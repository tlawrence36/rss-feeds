      "NEW YORK -- The 2025 Grammy Award nominations are just around the corner \u2014 who will compete for the top prizes?",
      "Nominees will be announced during a video stream live on the Grammy website and the Recording Academy\u2019s YouTube channel on Friday at 8 a.m. Pacific and 11 a.m. Eastern, kicking off with a pre-show 15 minutes earlier.",
      "A host of talent is on deck to announce the nominees, including Gayle King, Jim Gaffigan and a long list of past Grammy winners: Brandy Clark, Kirk Franklin, David Frost, Robert Gordon, Kylie Minogue, Gaby Moreno, Deanie Parker, Ben Platt, Mark Ronson, Hayley Williams and last year's best new artist recipient, Victoria Mon\u00e9t.",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 are eligible for nominations, so don\u2019t expect to see album nods for Future's \u201cMixtape Pluto\u201d (though Future and Metro Boomin's \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You\u201d is very likely to score a nomination), George Strait's \u201cCowboys and Dreamers,\u201d Tyler, the Creator\u2019s \u201cChromakopia,\u201d or \u201cWarriors,\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda's first full post-\u201cHamilton\u201d musical with Pulitzer finalist Eisa Davis.",
      "There's plenty of unknowns going into the announcements: Will Beyonc\u00e9 and Post Malone receive nominations in the country music categories following the success of their massive albums \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d and \u201cF-1 Trillion,\u201d respectively, even though they are megastars previously not directly associated with the genre?",
      "Will Shaboozey's \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy),\" the biggest song of the year that combines his country twang with the familiar sample of J Kwon\u2019s 2004 rap hit \u201cTipsy\" dominate?",
      "The 2025 Grammy Awards will air Feb. 2 live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles."

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 16:10:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
    "story": [
      "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
      "Megan Park feels a little bad that her movie is making so many people cry. It's not just a single tear either \u2014 more like full body sobs.",
      "She didn\u2019t set out to make a tearjerker with \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d now streaming on Prime Video. She just wanted to tell a story about a young woman in conversation with her older self. The film is quite funny (the dialogue between 18-year-old and almost 40-year-old Elliott happens because of a mushroom trip that includes a Justin Bieber cover), but it packs an emotional punch, too.",
      "Writing, Park said, is often her way of working through things. When she put pen to paper on \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d she was a new mom and staying in her childhood bedroom during the pandemic. One night, she and her whole nuclear family slept under the same roof. She didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the last time, and she started wondering what it would be like to have known that.",
      "In the film, older Elliott ( Aubrey Plaza ) advises younger Elliott ( Maisy Stella ) to not be so eager to leave her provincial town, her younger brothers and her parents and to slow down and appreciate things as they are. She also tells her to stay away from a guy named Chad who she meets the next day and discovers that, unfortunately, he's quite cute.",
      "At 38, Park is just getting started as a filmmaker. Her first, \u201cThe Fallout,\u201d in which Jenna Ortega plays a teen in the aftermath of a school shooting, had one of those pandemic releases that didn\u2019t even feel real. But it did get the attention of Margot Robbie \u2019s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, who reached out to Park to see what other ideas she had brewing.",
      "\u201cThey were very instrumental in encouraging me to go with it,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey\u2019re just really even-keeled, good people, which makes them great producers. They treat everybody the same, which is the vibe that I like. There\u2019s no ego, there\u2019s no hierarchy.\u201d",
      "LuckyChap even empowered her to cast Stella first and to build it out around her. In a more traditional setting, she said, you have to start with the most famous person.",
      "Park came to writing and directing after some 20 years of acting. The product of a small town in Canada (Lindsay, Ontario), she knew she loved the arts but had no connections to the industry. The only job she could imagine for herself was actor, she said. Luckily, she had some success at it, with roles in films (\"Charlie Bartlett\u201d) and television shows like \u201cLife with Derek\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d (she was Grace, the conservative cheerleader). It was on that show that she met one of her dearest friends, Shailene Woodley, and started to realize that perhaps acting wasn\u2019t quite her passion.",
      "There wasn\u2019t one \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, but she does remember seeing how passionate Woodley was about getting the role \u201cThe Descendants,\u201d which would prove to be her breakout.",
      "\u201cShe really wanted that role and she knew that it was her role and she was just like fighting for it and working so hard and was so passionate. I remember thinking that\u2019s so inspiring and so cool that she feels that way about this. And then I was like, \u2018(expletive), I don\u2019t feel that way about acting.\u2019\"",
      "Instead, Park found that spark in writing, and eventually directing, starting with shorts and music videos for the likes of Billie Eilish, Gucci Mane and even her husband, singer-songwriter Tyler Hilton, before setting off to do a feature.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know that writing and directing movies was a viable career. So I came about it a little bit backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so lucky that I had such an education of like 20 years on a film set before I was ever behind the camera, where I was really absorbing way more than I thought I was absorbing.\u201d",
      "As a filmmaker, Park said she has two aesthetic extremes inside of her. The first is \u201cheartfelt, evergreen, nostalgic movies.\u201d Think Chris Columbus, \u201cStepmom,\u201d \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d and \u201cMy Girl,\u201d she said. Her other passion is quiet, French, female-driven cinema. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cTomboy\u201d is the only movie she has downloaded on her computer. On set, she likes to keep things calm, reminding those around her that they\u2019re not \u201csaving lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI genuinely think that\u2019s an important mentality to have because people get so caught up in it. There\u2019s always going to be a fire, there\u2019s always going to be not enough time, but there\u2019s always going to be a fix to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to just be clear with what I need, but also really flexible. I think the best directors are people who consider their role as not as the end-all, be-all genius behind the magic because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re the curator of creating an environment for creativity to thrive.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s seen all the extremes as an actor: The energies that work, the ones that don\u2019t and how all actors need different things from the director. And her actors appreciate that about her.",
      "\u201cI want every single movie for the rest of my life to be directed by a woman,\u201d said Stella. \u201cIt was one of my favorite experiences. I was just constantly surrounded by female energy, which was very inspiring for me and very safe. It just felt very cozy and sweet and it was very easy to work in that environment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been almost a year now since \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d became one of the breakout films of the Sundance Film Festival, and almost three years since she started working on it, or, basically half of her nearly 5-year-old daughter\u2019s life (she calls it \u201cthe Maisie movie\u201d). With a new 4-month-old as well, she's just started work on another film. But she\u2019s still feeling the glow from \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d and the effect it\u2019s having on audiences.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really get your hopes that high that people are going to feel anything, let alone how deeply they seem to be feeling the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of surreal, honestly and really beautiful and hard to metabolize it all.\u201d"

      "Argentine prosecutors say that three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month",
      "BUENOS AIRES -- Three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "Prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea charged the three suspects, whose identities were not revealed, with \u200b\u200bthe crimes of \u201cabandonment of a person followed by death\u201d and \u201csupplying and facilitating the use of narcotics,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Madrea also requested their arrest to judge Laura Bruniard, who ruled the three cannot leave the country.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo, in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne\u2019s toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\u201d in the moments before his death.",
      "Investigators said hours after Payne\u2019s death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between Oct. 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer.",
      "The charges in Payne\u2019s case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor\u2019s personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic.",
      "Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018.",
      "Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cell phone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer\u2019s personal computer \u2013 which is damaged \u2013 and other devices that were seized.",
      "Payne\u2019s autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne committing suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",
      "The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan\u2019s concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.",

      "Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince\u2019s only full sibling, died Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",
      "Representatives for Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s private estate which is also a museum, studio, and concert venue in Chanhassen, Minnesota, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",

      "After months of reporting on what polls described as a remarkably close race, news outlets finally have the chance to report on actual results",
      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",
      "Neither Axios nor Politico would immediately confirm reports that some of their reporters were similarly banned, and the Trump campaign did not immediately return a call for comment.",

      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",
      "Trump stood to the side, grinning and beaming, as he listened to the commentator he once called \u201cnasty.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she posted a selfie with the former president on X that was captioned in part: \"God bless him. Go vote for him!\"",
      "Kelly was a popular Fox News host in 2016 when she questioned Trump during the first debate of the Republican primary about whether he had the temperament to be president.",
      "Trump largely dismissed Kelly\u2019s question at the debate, but later he went directly after her, first overnight on Twitter and later in interviews.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not very tough and not very sharp,\u201d Trump told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t respect her as a journalist.\u201d",
      "Referring to Kelly\u2019s questions during the debate, Trump said, \u201cThere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The comment was widely viewed as a sexist reference to menstruation.",
      "Trump later boycotted another debate on Fox because Kelly was one of the moderators.",
      "Kelly left Fox for NBC News. She was taken off the air following an uproar when she suggested it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween.",
      "She now hosts a SiriusXM satellite radio show that she has built into one of the highest-ranked on Chartable\u2019s list of news podcasts.",
      "\u201cAll that nonsense between us,\u201d Kelly said last year, \u201cis under the bridge.\u201d",
      "Kelly\u2019s appearance with Trump comes as early voting suggests a gender gap that favors Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Kelly was critical of some of the speakers who delivered crude and racist comments at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last month. One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",
      "The speakers, Kelly said, \u201ctook what was an amazing celebration of Trump, exciting and well-attended and hugely enthusiastic, and gave themselves a big black eye.\u201d"

The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

    "story": [
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d Generational ties also permeate the film adaptation, in which Malcolm Washington follows in his father Denzel Washington\u2019s footsteps in helping to bring the entirety of The Pittsburgh Cycle \u2014 a series of 10 plays \u2014 to the screen.",
      "Malcolm Washington did not start from scratch in his accomplished feature filmmaking debut. He enlisted much of the cast from the recent Broadway revival with Samuel L. Jackson (Doaker Charles), his brother, John David Washington (Boy Willie), Ray Fisher (Lymon) and Michael Potts (Whining Boy). Berniece, played by Danielle Brooks in the play, is now beautifully portrayed by Danielle Deadwyler. With such rich material and a cast for whom it\u2019s second nature, it would be hard, one imagines, to go wrong. Jackson\u2019s own history with the play goes back to its original run in 1987 when he was Boy Willie.",
      "It\u2019s not the simplest thing to make a play feel cinematic, but Malcolm Washington was up to the task. His film opens up the world of the Charles family beyond the living room. In fact, this adaptation, which Washington co-wrote with \u201cMudbound\u201d screenwriter Virgil Williams, goes beyond Wilson\u2019s text and shows us the past and the origins of the intricately engraved piano that\u2019s central to all the fuss. It even opens on a big, action-filled set piece in 1911, during which the piano is stolen from a white family\u2019s home. Another fleshes out Doaker's monologue in which he explains to the uninitiated, Fisher\u2019s Lymon, and the audience, the tortured history of the thing. While it might have been nice to keep the camera on Jackson, such a great, grounding presence throughout, the good news is that he really makes narration shine as well.",
      "Wilson purists will certainly have opinions on these artistic choices; But they let the film breathe a bit, offering some respite from the living room with the looming piano. And most of the film stays right there, in 1936. Boy Willie and Lymon descend early one morning, uninvited, on the Pittsburgh home of Berniece and her uncle Doaker. It\u2019s a family reunion with an agenda: They\u2019ve driven a truck full of watermelons up north from Mississippi, and Willie, Berniece\u2019s younger brother, wants to sell the watermelons and then the piano. The dusty old instrument represents to him a chance to let the past go and start a future. With the money, he wants to buy the land that his enslaved ancestors worked. Berniece has other ideas about the piano, namely keeping it. It\u2019s a connection to the past, not an anchor. Besides, it might be haunted.",
      "Yes, \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d in theaters Friday and streaming on Netflix on Nov. 22, isn\u2019t just a meditation on family history. It\u2019s also a literal ghost story, with creaks, spooks and shadows lurking when the piano is disturbed. Deadwyler is electric as Berniece, who bears the brunt of the haunting, walking on eggshells in her life, trying to care for her young daughter and fend off passes from men who assume she can only be fulfilled with one at her side. Now she must deal with her somewhat manic brother who might, Doaker wisely reminds, actually, annoyingly, have a point. Perhaps the film academy will make up for their snub of her performance in \u201cTill\u201d with this turn.",
      "Regardless of your familiarity with Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is a worthwhile, captivating and moving watch full of charismatic performers. Talent isn\u2019t always genetic, but the Washington family is putting in the work to prove otherwise. And with \u201cFences,\u201d\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and now \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d they\u2019re making a mark with a bold and ambitious project that is probably long overdue. Only seven more to go.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters Friday and streaming Nov. 22, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong language, violent content, some suggestive references and smoking.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "The deal with federal prosecutors was described in a letter partially endorsed by a Manhattan federal judge. It calls for the entertainer to be sentenced to a month in jail, followed by a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfew. He would also be subject to electronic monitoring.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he will sentence the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez immediately after he admits to the violations at a Nov. 12 hearing. He said he will require each side to explain why a one-month jail sentence followed by three months of home incarceration, detention or curfew are sufficient for repeated violations of probation.",
      "The terms of the deal also call for Tekashi 6ix9ine to submit to supervision from the court's Probation Department for another year.",
      "Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, was within a few months of being free from court supervision when he was arrested on Oct. 29 after his probation officer complained that he wasn't following rules about obtaining permission in advance to travel and that he had failed drug tests.",
      "In 2019, Engelmayer sentenced him to two years in prison in a racketeering case after the musician pleaded guilty that same year to charges accusing him of joining and directing violence by the gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was freed months early from his prison sentence after complaining that his ailments made him particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation's jails and prisons.",
      "Engelmayer, expressing dismay at the artist's apparent failure to follow the rules, noted at a hearing last month that he had granted compassionate release to him during the coronavirus crisis.",
      "The rapper apologized and told the judge he was \u201cnot a bad person.\u201d"

      "On the night before Election Day, at campaign events across the country, celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi turned out in force for Kamala Harris ' presidential bid.",
      "The battleground state of Pennsylvania was particularly starry: In Pittsburgh, the vice president's rally featured Cedric the Entertainer, Katy Perry and Andra Day. In Philadelphia, the finale of Harris' daylong dash across Pennsylvania, performers and presenters included DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe and Ricky Martin, while Gaga sang a soulful \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Winfrey brought first-time voters to the stage.",
      "Republican Donald Trump was decidedly unimpressed with Harris' celebrity lineup.",
      "At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyonc\u00e9. He spoke dismissively about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 would come in. Everyone\u2019s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 did not perform at the event but was joined onstage by her Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, and gave a joyful, impassioned speech met with cheers.",
      "Previously, Beyonc\u00e9 allowed the Harris campaign to take on her 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d a cut from her landmark 2016 album \u201cLemonade,\u201d as its anthem.",
      "Trump added that Harris should have learned a lesson from Hillary Clinton and had Beyonc\u00e9 speak after her, saying, \u201cThat way the people stay.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 performed at a campaign event for Democratic nominee Clinton in Cleveland in the days leading up to the election.",
      "\u201cThey booed like hell, but the press didn\u2019t play that,\u201d Trump continued in his description of Beyonc\u00e9's appearance at the Harris event.",
      "He insisted his campaign doesn't need celebrities to pack in a crowd, adding: \"We don\u2019t need a star because we have policy. We have great policy.\u201d",
      "At another point in the same rally, though, he enthused: \"So many celebrities here, it\u2019s incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up,\u201d introducing his former secretary of state.",
      "Trump also was joined by Megyn Kelly and baseball star Roberto Clemente\u2019s son.",
      "Harris lined up performers to speak and play at campaign rallies in all seven battleground states on Monday, and melded them all into one Democratic get-out-the-vote livestream.",
      "In Las Vegas, performers included Christina Aguilera and electro-dance duo Sofi Tukker. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, took the stage.",
      "In Detroit, performers included Jon Bon Jovi, who sang a quiet acoustic version of his band's working-class anthem \u201cLivin' on a Prayer.\u201d"

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "British filmmaker Andrea Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments",
      "\u201cIs it too real for ya?\u201d blares in the background of Andrea Arnold\u2019s latest film, \u201cBird,\u201d a 12-year-old Bailey (Nykiya Adams) rides with her shirtless, tattoo-covered dad, Bug (Barry Keoghan), on his electric scooter past scenes of poverty in working-class Kent.",
      "The song\u2019s question \u2014 courtesy of the Irish post-punk band Fontains D.C. \u2014 is an acute one for \u201cBird.\u201d Arnold\u2019s films ( \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cFish Tank\u201d) are rigorous in their gritty naturalism. Her fiction films \u2014 this is her first in eight years \u2014 tend toward bleak, hand-held verit\u00e9 in rough-and-tumble real-world locations. Her last film, \u201cCow,\u201d documented a mother cow separated from her calf on a dairy farm.",
      "Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments. A dream of something more is tantalizing just out of reach. In \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d peace comes to Star (Sasha Lane) only when she submerges underwater.",
      "In \u201cBird,\u201d though, this sense of otherworldly possibility is made flesh, or at least feathery. After a confusing night, Bailey awakens in a field where she encounters a strange figure in a skirt ( Franz Rogowski ) who arrives, like Mary Poppins, with a gust a wind. His name, he says, is Bird. He has a soft sweetness that doesn\u2019t otherwise exist in Bailey\u2019s hardscrabble and chaotic life.",
      "She\u2019s skeptical of him at first, but he keeps lurking about, hovering gull-like on rooftops. He cranes his neck now and again like he\u2019s watching out for Bailey. And he does watch out for her, helping Bailey through a hard coming of age: the abusive boyfriend (James Nelson-Joyce) of her mother (Jasmine Jobson); her half brother (Jason Buda) slipping into vigilante violence; her father marrying a new girlfriend.",
      "The introduction of surrealism has the ironic effect of breaking the spell that has marked Arnold\u2019s best films. \u201cBird,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is, like the writer-director\u2019s vivid previous work, a movie only she could make. Arnold has described it as the hardest thing she\u2019s ever created, and it\u2019s easy to applaud her for grasping at something in \u201cBird\u201d that ultimately is just out of reach. A resolutely realistic filmmaker turning to magical realism has the uncomfortable effect of making the whole movie, not just the Rogowski bits, feel inauthentic. Instead of being \u201ctoo real for ya,\u201d \u201cBird,\u201d with its in-your-face poverty and narrative extremes, never feels particularly real at all.",
      "The most incongruous parts of \u201cBird,\u201d though, might not be the mysterious avian friend. (Rogowski, a compelling performer, only ever feels half in the movie, as if \u201cBird\u201d can\u2019t quite commit to him being there, either.) Keoghan is a reliably arresting actor who here feels out of place. He doesn\u2019t seem even vaguely fatherly, and while that might be part of the point, too many other things about Bug feel more performative than genuine. There\u2019s his scheme to use hallucinogenic slime from a toad to pay for his wedding, for starters. Add in some karaoke scenes and the sensation creeps in that \u201cBird\u201d is being less compelled by its own story than it is by a pursuit of Arnold\u2019s previous style.",
      "\u201cBird\u201d may go down as a rare miss for Arnold but you can still see the keenness of her eye and the nimbleness of her camera, with her regular cinematographer Robbie Ryan. And that\u2019s true never so much as when the camera is on Adams, a talent, whose melancholy eyes say more than all the theatrics around her.",
      "\u201cBird,\u201d a Mubi release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage throughout, some violent content and drug material.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "DENVER -- A former Denver elections worker who says she was fired for speaking out about her safety concerns on comedian Jon Stewart's show filed a federal lawsuit Monday, alleging election officials wanted to silence her and violated her First Amendment rights.",
      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "On election night 2020, Fox News sparked an internal crisis with a bold call that Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona, putting the Democrat on the path to victory",
      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "RICHMOND, Va. -- U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat representing Virginia's most populous county in Congress, said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer.",
      "The announcement comes after Connolly, 74, handily won his ninth House term on Tuesday by defeating Republican Mike Van Meter, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, in Virginia's 11th District.",
      "\u201cI will attack this the only way I know how \u2013 with Irish fight and humor,\u201d Connolly said in a statement.",
      "As he enters his new term representing Fairfax County and the wealthy suburbs outside Washington, the congressman will be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, he said. In his statement, Connolly said he had no symptoms besides occasional abdominal aches.",
      "\u201cMy wonderful staff and I look forward to serving you all in this new term and in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "The congressman has been a fixture in northern Virginia politics for roughly 30 years after he was first elected as a Fairfax County supervisor in 1995. In Congress, he has played a leading role in oversight investigations.",
      "His tenure as a congressman has not been without hardship. Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to Connolly's Fairfax, Virginia, district office looking to kill him with a baseball bat. Connolly wasn\u2019t there, so the man, who a judge had since found not guilty by reason of insanity, attacked two staffers.",

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died has been sentenced to two years in prison",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil is currently \u201cinvaded by illegal websites that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7\u00e3o, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",
      "\u201cWelcome,\u201d one long-time attendee said, in a greeting that has become a regular for the group. \u201cToday, you are the most important person here.\u201d",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",

      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo.

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",

      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War.

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

    "summary": "An amendment to New York&rsquo;s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pregnancy outcomes.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

    "story": [
      "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing.\u201d",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 05:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
    "story": [
      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "The report came a day after former President Donald Trump won Tuesday\u2019s election, gaining a second term as president. Trump has pledged to increase tariffs on imports from China to 60%, adding to uncertainty over the outlook for exports to the U.S.",

      "Spain\u2019s catastrophic floods have left behind staggering devastation and despair",
      "MADRID -- The catastrophic torrential rains that overflowed rivers and normally dry canals in eastern Spain last week triggered flash floods that submerged entire communities and killed scores of people.",
      "The deluge left behind a landscape of devastation, especially in Valencia, the hardest-hit region. The search for the dead and missing continues, more than a week since the Oct. 29 floods hit \u2014 as well as a gargantuan cleanup and recovery effort.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Spain\u2019s deadliest natural disaster of the century, by the numbers:",
      "The historic floods caused 219 deaths, 211 of them in the Valencia region alone. Another seven people died in neighboring Castilla La Mancha and one more in southern Andalusia.",
      "Ninety-three people have been officially declared missing, but authorities admit that the real number could be higher. Another 54 bodies remain unidentified. In total, 36,605 people have been rescued, according to authorities.",
      "The full extent of the damage is unknown, but Spain\u2019s Consortium for Insurance Compensation, a public-private entity that pays insurance claims for extreme risks like floods, estimates that it will spend at least 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in compensation.",
      "The consortium has received 116,000 insurance claims for flood damage, with 60% of the claims for cars and 31% for homes. Spain\u2019s Association of Insurance Companies anticipates the flooding will break a historic record for payouts.",
      "The Transport Ministry has so far repaired 232 kilometers (144 miles) of road and rail tracks but the highspeed train line between Valencia and Madrid is still demolished.",
      "The central government has approved a 10.6 billion-euro ($11.6-billion) relief package for families, business and townhalls. The Valencia regional government is asking Madrid for 31 billion euros ($33 billion) in aid as well.",
      "The drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures helped magnify the floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain's meteorological agency says that 30.4 inches fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis, an all-time national record for rainfall set on Oct. 29. The devastated village of Chiva also received more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months.",
      "The storms honed in on the Magro and Turia Rivers and the Poyo canal, turning them into swift currents that swept away everything in their path. To the human eye, it looked as if a tsunami-like wave of water and mud cut a swath through the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia.",
      "The European Space Agency said that, according to satellite images captured on Oct. 31, water covered an area of 15,633 hectares (38,600 acres). About 190,000 people were directly affected, the agency said.",
      "In all, 78 municipalities had at least one resident perish in the floods.",
      "The emergency operation mobilized by central authorities has grown to more than 17,000 troops and police officers.",
      "The operation includes 8,000 soldiers \u2014 2,100 of them belonging to military emergency units specialized in disaster response \u2014 along with 9,200 additional police officers from other parts of Spain.",
      "Thousands of ordinary citizens volunteered, with no definite estimate as to exactly how many, have helped from day one with the cleanup effort.",
      "The government said that in the first week after the floods, authorities restored electricity to 147,000 homes and distributed some 178,000 bottles of water to places that were still without drinking water.",
      "Spanish authorities have yet to say how many calls about missing people they received, give an estimate of the property damage, or release a calculation of how much land was devastated.",
      "And at this point, no one can guess when the recovery effort will be concluded.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 10:35:49 -0500",
    "summary": "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of &ldquo;hugs, not bullets,&rdquo; in which the country&rsquo;s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
    "story": [
      "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of \u201chugs, not bullets,\u201d in which the country\u2019s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
      "MEXICO CITY -- For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d strategy, in which its leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country. The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \u201cno bullets\u201d part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country\u2019s 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren\u2019t harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But Sheinbaum has had to perform some verbal gymnastics to avoid disowning the policy entirely.",
      "\u201cClearly, it isn\u2019t a question of hugs for criminals, nobody has ever said that,\u201d Sheinbaum said soon after taking office. The hugs, she said, were meant for impoverished youths, to avoid having them recruited as cartel gunmen.",
      "\u201cThere are traces of a change in tone toward organized crime, but it\u2019s too early to call,\u201d said Falko Ernst, a security analyst. \u201cIt seems unlikely that the Sheinbaum administration would risk a politically inconvenient, steady stream of violent imagery by betting on wholesale balazos (bullets)-only strategy,\u201d but there may be more willingness to confront \u201cthe most overt and brazen displays of power\u201d by the cartels.",
      "But it is hard to imagine Sheinbaum issuing public praise for drug lords for behaving themselves, or saying \u2014 as L\u00f3pez Obrador did \u2014 that she will \u201ctell on them to their fathers and grandfathers\u201d if they cause too much violence.",
      "She has also been unwilling to tolerate criminals taking police and soldiers hostage, or to crow about reductions in Mexico\u2019s \u201clethality index\u201d \u2014 the measure of suspects killed, wounded or taken into custody, versus casualties on the law enforcement side \u2014 the way her predecessor did.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador famously called off the 2019 arrest of drug lord Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, and ordered his release, after his Sinaloa cartel threatened to plunge the northern city of Culiacan into chaos to win his freedom. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he made the decision to avoid bloodshed.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been a tad different. On her first day in office, soldiers in the southern state of Chiapas opened fire on a truck that \u201clooked like one used by criminal groups.\u201d But after shooting up the truck, they found only migrants, six of whom were killed and 10 wounded.",
      "Ten days later, army and National Guard troops killed three innocent bystanders as they were pursuing suspected gunmen. And this weekend, the National Guard opened fire on a truck carrying migrants, killing two Colombians and wounding at least four.",
      "Then there are the lopsided death tolls: L\u00f3pez Obrador always criticized previous administrations for shootouts in which all the suspects were killed, and very few were taken alive. But in Sheinbaum\u2019s third week in office, soldiers in Sinaloa killed 19 drug cartel suspects and arrested one in a confrontation, but suffered not a scratch themselves.",
      "And toward the end of her first month in office, soldiers pursuing cartel gunmen who had killed two local policemen killed 17 of them but lost no soldiers. Most of the dead, and 10 of the 15 gunmen arrested in the confrontation, were Guatemalan.",
      "\u201cThe hugs not bullets strategy ended some time ago,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo, pointing to an increased number of high-level drug arrests and extraditions of suspects. \u201cThe U.S. government pressured Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to resume the capture of high-level drug lords.\u201d",
      "One of the key differences Sheinbaum faces is that Mexican cartels have gotten involved in the lucrative trade of smuggling migrants from far-away countries.",
      "In the old days, the cartels took a cut from smugglers moving Central Americans, who used to make up the vast majority of those crossing Mexico to reach the United States. Those migrants paid hundreds or a few thousand dollars apiece.",
      "Since smugglers opened up a new route through the Darien Gap, people from farther away have been crossing Mexico, and they can pay far higher smuggling fees.",
      "Simultaneously, an immigration crackdown in the U.S. and Mexico has meant a significant number of Central and South Americans now have no avenue to get into the United States, said military analyst Juan Ibarrola, noting, \u201cIt is big business, and it is a far more profitable business than drugs.\u201d",
      "Ibarrola claims the cartels are now using migrants both as human shields, and sometimes as cannon fodder for their squads of hitmen.",
      "\u201cThe recruitment of larger batches of foreign fighters is yet another sign of the gradual deepening of Mexico\u2019s armed conflicts,\u201d said Ernst. \u201cLeft unchecked \u2014 much like the employment of homemade explosive devices \u2014 it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been allowed to expand.\u201d",
      "Expand is exactly what the cartels did during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s six-year term from late 2018 to 2024.",
      "\u201cFor six years we were ruled by the policies of a president who did not understand, or who did not realize, that the worst thing he could have done, the worst error he could have made, was not to use legal force against criminal violence,\u201d said Ibarrola, who is convinced the policy has now changed.",
      "The other problem Sheinbaum faces is the result of her determination to continue with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of militarizing Mexican law enforcement \u2014 essentially giving soldiers a task they weren\u2019t trained to do.",
      "Together with the mix of migrants and drug traffickers, it seems almost a certain recipe for more deaths of innocent bystanders.",
      "\u201cIt is a fact that the National Guard does not correctly apply the rules of engagement on the use of force,\u201d said Saucedo. \u201cThey tend to open fire before investigating or trying to detain criminal suspects.\u201d",

      "Lone Russian drones and also swarms of drones entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in what was an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents.",
      "Ukrainian air defenses \u201cneutralized\u201d three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital as well as residential and office buildings in Kyiv, local authorities said. A fire was ignited on the 33rd floor of an apartment building.",
      "At least two people were reported injured.",
      "Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost every day, with nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia\u2019s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Donald Trump elected as the next U.S. president. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine\u2019s appetite for the fight and sap the West\u2019s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict.",
      "The Russian barrages mostly involve Iranian Shahed drones, which terrorize civilians, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the state Center for Countering Disinformation.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down what bystanders described as an American drone early Friday, potentially the latest downing of a U.S. spy drone as the militants continue their attacks on the Red Sea corridor.",
      "The U.S. military acknowledged the videos circulating online showing what appeared to be a flaming aircraft dropping out of the sky and a field of burning debris in what those off-camera described as an area of Yemen's al-Jawf province. The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video.",
      "The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles capable of downing aircraft such as the Iranian missile known as the 358. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.",
      "The Houthis have been a key component of Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\" during the Mideast wars that includes Lebanon's Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for downing the aircraft. However, it can take their fighters hours or even days after an incident before they acknowledge it.",
      "Since Houthis seized the country\u2019s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the rebels have shot down MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military has declined to offer a total figure for the number of drones it has lost during that time.",
      "Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months.",
      "In October, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the Houthis."

      "It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October.",
      "The same ship transferred to Albania the first 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin \u2014 Bangladesh and Egypt \u2014 were not safe enough for them to be sent back.",
      "The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy\u2019s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board.",

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable.",
      "On Oct. 21, Italy\u2019s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama.",

      "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% on Thursday after inflation across the U.K. fell significantly, relieving some pressure on borrowers who have faced elevated mortgage and loan costs.",
      "The bank said eight of the nine members of its rate-setting panel backed the reduction \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 while one opted to keep borrowing costs on hold. The latest cut comes after inflation in the U.K. fell to an annual rate of 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Though inflation has fallen below the bank's target of 2%, Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned that interest rates would not be falling too fast over coming months, partly because last week's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here.\u201d",
      "He added that it's very unlikely that interest rates will fall to the very low levels that persisted in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008. During the coronavirus pandemic, which erupted in early 2020, interest rates around the world fell to zero, or just above zero in the case of the Bank of England.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to cut interest rates later Thursday.",
      "Economists have warned that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "\u201cEven though interest rates have further to fall, the upward pressure on inflation from the budget and growing global risks, including possible new U.S. tariffs, could mean that policy is loosened more modestly than many anticipated,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",
      "The decision comes a week after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "Rate-setters considered the budget measures during their deliberations and concluded they would likely boost growth by 0.75 percentage points and inflation by 0.5 percentage points over the coming year.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "Bailey said it was \u201cnot useful or wise to enter into speculation\u201d about what policies might be introduced by the incoming Trump administration and that the Bank of England only factors in policies that have already been announced when it compiles its economic projections."

      "Later the same day, a mortar fired by insurgents landed near a road in the Tirah valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, killing two schoolchildren who were going to school on foot, police said.",
      "The Pakistani military has launched dozens of operations against the Pakistani Taliban and other insurgents in South Waziristan and other former tribal regions nearby, but the militants continue to carry out frequent attacks.",
      "On Thursday, Naqvi met with Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong in Islamabad to brief him about an investigation into an attack Tuesday in which a guard shot and wounded two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in the port city of Karachi, allegedly over a private dispute.",
      "China has frequently demanded better security for its nationals who are in Pakistan to work for Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. An unknown number of Chinese people are also working at factories in the country."

      "JERUSALEM -- Armed Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned church compound in the contested city of Jerusalem on Thursday, the French foreign ministry said, briefly detaining two consulate employees and prompting the top French diplomat to abandon his planned visit to the site.",
      "The unusual incident threatened to further strain relations between Israel and France weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s call for an arms embargo on Israel prompted backlash from right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "The French Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Israeli ambassador in protest in the coming days.",
      "A strongly worded statement from France said Israeli security forces had intruded on the courtyard of the Church of the Pater Noster, angering French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot and prompting him to abandon his scheduled visit there.",
      "The ministry said Israeli police detained two staff members of the French Consulate in Jerusalem despite their diplomatic status, adding that the employees were released only after Barrot intervened.",
      "\u201cThis attack on the integrity of a domain placed under the responsibility of France is likely to weaken the bonds I have, in fact, come to cultivate with Israel at a time when we all need to make progress in the region on the road to peace,\u201d Barrot told reporters in Jerusalem.",
      "Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials Thursday in the city, where he pleaded for a cease-fire to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and called for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon \u2014 a former French protectorate that Israel invaded last month in its broadening military campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group.",
      "\u201cThese actions are unacceptable,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry statement said of Thursday's fracas between Israeli security forces and French diplomatic staffers. \u201cFrance condemns (these actions) all the more vigorously as they come at a time when it is doing everything it can to work towards de-escalating the violence in the region.\u201d",
      "Israeli police portrayed the controversy as a misunderstanding, saying that two church workers who declined to identify themselves had refused entry to Israeli security guards accompanying Minister Barrot on his church visit.",
      "Israeli police said they held the men for some 20 minutes and released them once they were identified as employees of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, which is the protector of French religious communities and four holy sites in the city.",
      "The Israeli police said all foreign ministers on official visits to Israel are assigned Israeli security guards for their trips. It said the logistics of Barrot's visit were worked out beforehand with the French Embassy in Israel, warning the public against contributing to \u201cmisleading narratives\" about the altercation.",
      "The compound that Barrot had planned to visit \u2014 on the Mount of Olives overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem \u2014 holds a church originally built by Crusaders that believed the site to be where Jesus taught the Pater Noster, or Lord\u2019s Prayer.",
      "It was later acquired by Princess H\u00e9lo\u00efse de la Tour d\u2019Auvergne, who had the prayer written in calligraphy in numerous languages on the walls of the cloisters and courtyard, also home to the the ruins of the Byzantine Eleona Church. The site was entrusted to French Carmelite nuns in 1874.",
      "\u201cThis domain is not only one that has belonged to France for over 150 years,\u201d Barrot said. \u201cIt's one where France has ensured security and maintenance with enormous care.\u201d",
      "Thursday's incident was reminiscent of several others skirmishes over the years between irritated French officials and assertive Israeli bodyguards.",
      "In 2020, President Macron lost his temper at Israeli security officers who had insisted on accompanying him inside another French church in Jerusalem.",
      "In 1996, then-French President Jacques Chirac accused Israeli security forces of pushing and shoving his entourage in a spat that even drew an apology from a young Prime Minister Netanyahu during his first year in office.",
      "Such stand-offs take on symbolic significance in Jerusalem, among the most fiercely contested swaths of real estate on earth.",
      "Israel has viewed Jerusalem as its \u201cunified, eternal\u201d capital since capturing east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel more than a year ago, President Macron has stressed his support of Israel and its right to defend itself. But tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Macron has demanded that Israel do more to avoid the rapidly mounting civilian casualties in its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Later Thursday, Minister Barrot held talks on the conflict with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank."

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- It\u2019s Friday night in Downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile, and a group of 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual.",
      "Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines \u2014 and unleashed a wave of panic \u2014 when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where\u202fhalf of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association.",
      "Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years.",
      "\u201cThese types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,\u201d said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that\u2019s because, \u201cuntil very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.\u201d",
      "Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions.",
      "While they embrace the term Satanist, they don\u2019t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life.",
      "Rather than gods, they praise humankind.",
      "\u201cYou are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,\u201d said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He notes that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed \u201cto bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.\u201d",
      "Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many hold public-facing jobs, citing growing threats.",
      "While Hollywood movies like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and TV series such as \u201cTrue Detective\u201d helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want people killing in the name of Satan,\u201d said Haborym.",
      "In order to join Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist.",
      "Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name \u2014 normally that of a demon or fallen angel \u2014 with which they will be identified inside the Temple and among other associates.",
      "Founded in 2021, Chile\u2019s Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested the country\u2019s Ministry of Justice to legally recognize it as a religious association.",
      "A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile\u2019s main religious denominations.",
      "\u201cThe history of Satanism is well known (and) it has often been the cause of tragedies,\u201d the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement.",
      "Following the steps of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices.",
      "Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists, others are witches or believe in the power of magic.",
      "\u201cWe do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,\u201d said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile.",
      "His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group.",
      "Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals.",
      "\u201cIn Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,\u201d said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah\u2019s Witness family. \u201cIf we compare both, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are the real sect,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9stor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches.",
      "\u201cIt may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,\u201d he said.",
      "It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society.",
      "Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions.",
      "\u201cWe comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,\u201d says Haborym. \u201cSo there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we\u2019re a controversial figure.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Israeli residents of a settlement named after Donald Trump hope his return to office will breathe new life into their tiny community in the Golan Heights",
      "RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights -- Israeli residents of \u201cTrump Heights\u201d are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights.",
      "During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel\u2019s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him.",
      "But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \u201cRamat Trump\u201d in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel\u2019s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation.",
      "Trump\u2019s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements.",
      "\u201cMaybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\u201d said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights\u2019 community manager.",
      "Ori Kallner, head of the Golan\u2019s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\u201d he said.",
      "Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes.",
      "An enormous sign with the settlement\u2019s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition.",
      "Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,\u201d said Freimann.",
      "Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter.",
      "Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized.",
      "That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would \u201cfully recognize\u201d Israel\u2019s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel\u2019s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation.",
      "Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there.",
      "According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people \u2014 roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation.",
      "Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel\u2019s economic center in Tel Aviv.",
      "That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later.",
      "In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump\u2019s birthday and said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.\u201d",
      "The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords.",
      "He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how.",
      "Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy.",
      "\u201cCongratulations on history\u2019s greatest comeback!\u201d the Israeli leader said in a statement. \u201cYour historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.\u201d",
      "At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: \u201cThe Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won\u2019t stop growing.\u201d"

      "The militia was initially formed in the 1990s as a defense against anti-India insurgents in remote Himalayan villages that government forces could not reach quickly. As the insurgency waned in their areas and as some militia members gained notoriety for brutality and rights violations, the militia was largely disbanded.",
      "However last year, after the killing of seven Hindus in two attacks in a remote mountainous village near the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, authorities revived the militia and began rearming and training thousands of villagers, including some teenagers.",

      "Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country.",
      "The protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging.",
      "Opposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the Oct. 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet.",
      "International rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed by police since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices.",
      "The internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it.",
      "The candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on Oct. 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years.",
      "Even before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, known as Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million.",
      "The European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies.",
      "Independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 18.",
      "The men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee.",
      "Since then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms.",
      "Mondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests \u201cso that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.\u201d",
      "Authorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests.",
      "Rights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard.",
      "Mozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias.",
      "The country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado.",
      "Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule.",

      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said."

    "summary": "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
    "story": [
      "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
      "Carbon pollution from private jets has soared in the past five years, with most of those small planes spewing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in about two hours of flying than the average person does in about a year, a new study finds.",
      "About a quarter million of the super wealthy \u2014 worth a total of $31 trillion \u2014 last year emitted 17.2 million tons (15.6 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide flying in private jets, according to Thursday's study in the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment. That's about the same amount as the 67 million people who live in Tanzania,",
      "Private jet emissions jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, according to the European research team that calculated those figures by examining more than 18.6 million flights of about 26,000 airplanes over five years.",
      "Only 1.8% of the carbon pollution from aviation is spewed by private jets and aviation as a whole is responsible for about 4% of the human-caused heat-trapping gases, the study said.",
      "It may seem like a small amount, but it's a matter of fairness and priorities, said the study's lead author, Stefan Gossling, a transportation researcher at the business school of Sweden's Linnaeus University.",
      "\u201cThe damage is done by those with a lot of money and the cost is borne by those with very little money,\" Gossling said.",
      "The highest emitting private jet user that the team tracked \u2014 but did not identify by name \u2014 spewed 2,645 tons (2,400 metric tons) of carbon dioxide in plane use, Gossling said. That's more than 500 times the global per person average of either 5.2 tons (4.7 metric tons) that the World Bank calculates or the 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) that the International Energy Agency figures and Gossling cites.",
      "\u201cThis report presents further proof that billionaires are causing the climate crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of the advocacy organization Climate Organizing Hub. \u201cThey are clinging to their private jets and oil profits while regular people see increasing floods, hurricanes and wildfires.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year the International Energy Agency calculated that the world's top 1% of super-emitting people had carbon footprints more than 1,000 times bigger than the globe's poorest 1%.",
      "Gossling's study counted more than 35,600 tons (32,300 metric tons) of carbon pollution from just five global events \u2014 2022\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, 2023\u2019s World Economic Forum, 2023\u2019s Super Bowl, the 2023 Cannes film festival and the 2023 United Nations climate negotiations in Dubai. That came from 3,500 private jet flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a grim joke that the billionaire class is flying private jets to the annual climate conferences, and the United Nations should crack down on this hypocritical practice,\u201d said Jean Su, energy justice director for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "Researchers also examined more than 1,200 flights by celebrity actors, singers and directors, but Gossling declined to give the public figures\u2019 names.",
      "Many private flights aren't even for business \u201cnor are they necessary,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThey are very often lifestyle related.\u201d",
      "While the study \u201cdoes shine a bright light on some of the most gluttonous emitters, i.e. the very wealthy,\u201d University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said the focus shouldn't be on individual behaviors and someone's carbon footprint. He called that \u201ca distraction from the primary task at hand, which is decarbonizing our societal infrastructure through systematic change and policy.\u201d",
      "That's the problem, Gossling said.",
      "\u201cWe have been told for a long time that it is the system that needs to change, not the individual,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThat has meant that nobody has been responsible for their lifestyles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is that the 26,000 aircraft and the individuals using them will say \u2018We are just a small group. We are not relevant in terms of emissions.\u2019 But everybody else will look at the small group and say, 'Look these are the super-emitters, if they are not relevant, how can we be relevant?\u201d Gossling said. \u201cAnd then you have this pointing at each other of two different groups that locks us in a circular argument.\u201d",
      "About 51% of those private jets burn at least 239 gallons of fuel per hour. That's translates to more carbon emissions in two hours and one minute than the IEA's estimate of the average person's yearly 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) of pollutants, the study calculated.",
      "\u201cGiven that technology is not going to resolve (climate change), I think the answer is clear. We need to start at the top,\u201d Gossling said.",
      "Gossling said the way to address the high-flying emissions is to charge a tax or landing fee equivalent to the damage done by each ton of emissions. That's about $200 or 200 euros. Westin called for a private jet ban.",
      "The United States is by far the hub of private jets with more than 68% of the globe's private aircraft, about 5 per 100,000 people, the study found. But Gossling said private jets are everywhere, even in poor countries.",
      "In the United States, Alaska has the most private jet flights per person, at nearly 5,000 per 100,000 residents, according to a different study by the student travel company Rustic Pathways.",

      "The economy has shown signs of life in the last two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

    "story": [
      "About 1,100 workers at the Stellantis Jeep factory in Toledo, Ohio, are facing layoffs early next year as the company takes further steps to cut high inventory at dealers",
      "DETROIT -- About 1,100 workers at the Stellantis Jeep factory in Toledo, Ohio, are facing layoffs early next year as the company takes further steps to cut high inventory at dealerships.",
      "Stellantis said Thursday that the Toledo South plant, which makes the Jeep Gladiator midsize pickup truck, will go from two daily shifts to one as early as Jan. 5.",
      "Sales of the Gladiator, the pickup truck version of the Jeep Wrangler SUV, are down nearly 21% so far this year to 36,519, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "\u201cThese are difficult actions to take, but they are necessary to enable the company to regain its competitive edge and eventually return production to prior levels,\u201d Stellantis said.",
      "A message was left Thursday seeking comment from the United Auto Workers union, which represents employees at the Toledo plant.",
      "Under the union contract with Stellantis, laid-off workers will get supplemental pay for one year that, when combined with state unemployment benefits, will equal 74% of regular pay. They\u2019ll also get health insurance coverage for two years, Stellantis said.",
      "The move is the latest action by the company as it struggles with high inventory on dealer lots in the U.S. Stellantis' overall sales have been down most of the year in the U.S., and discounts to counter high sticker prices that came after a poor second quarter didn\u2019t work.",
      "In August, the company warned that it could lay off as many as 2,450 of the 3,700 union workers at the pickup truck plant in Warren, Michigan, north of Detroit. It said at the time the number of job cuts will be lower because of early retirement offers.",
      "In the U.S., Stellantis\u2019 dealer inventory ballooned to just over 430,000 vehicles in June. Third-quarter sales fell 20%, and they\u2019re down over 17% for the first nine months. The rest of the auto industry saw sales increase 1% from January through September.",
      "CEO Carlos Tavares said in October that inventory dropped by 52,000 in recent months, and the company is trying to get below 350,000 by Christmas for a \u201cfresh start\u201d going into the new year.",
      "Last month the world's fourth-largest automaker, which was created by the 2021 merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, reported a 27% drop in net revenues for the third quarter.",
      "Tavares has been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union this year, caught off guard by too many high-priced vehicles on dealer lots. Tavares has been trying to cut costs by delaying factory openings, laying off union workers and offering buyouts to salaried employees.",
      "The union is threatening to strike against the company over delays in reopening an assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, which Stellantis blames on a slowing market."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:10:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "Amazon workers in Alabama will have the opportunity decide whether to unionize for the third time in three years",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Amazon workers in Alabama will decide for the third time in three years whether to unionize after a federal judge ruled that the retail giant improperly influenced the most recent vote in which employees rejected a union.",
      "Administrative law judge Michael Silverstein on Tuesday ordered the third vote for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Birmingham, after determining that Amazon committed six violations leading up to the second election in March 2022.",
      "Amazon managers surveilled employees' union activities and threatened workers with plant closure if they voted with the union, Silverstein said in an 87-page decision. Amazon managers also removed pro-union materials from areas where anti-union materials were available, the judge determined.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board also found improper interference in the first election in 2021, leading to the redo in 2022.",
      "Silverstein\u2019s decision comes after months of testimony and is the latest development in a nationwide legal battle involving Amazon, the National Labor Relations Board and unions spearheading unionization efforts. Some states, like California, have fined the mega retailer for labor violations.",
      "Both Amazon and the union that organized the vote in Bessemer said that they would appeal the judge's order.",
      "The president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Stuart Appelbaum, affirmed the court's findings that Amazon broke labor laws.",
      "But he also said that he believed Amazon was likely to commit similar violations in a third election if the court did not order \u201csignificant and meaningful remedies\u201d to protect the vote.",
      "Specifically, the union requested access to private meetings between Amazon representatives and workers, as well as training for Amazon supervisors on labor laws. The judge declined those requests.",
      "\u201cThe record reveals that there are over a hundred managers at BHM1, but my findings of unfair labor practices are limited to four managers, who each committed isolated unfair labor practice,\u201d the judge ruled, referring to the Bessemer facility.",
      "Appelbaum said that the union would appeal that decision.",
      "\u201cAmazon must be held accountable, and we\u2019ll be filing accordingly,\u201d Appelbaum said.",
      "Mary Kate Paradis, a spokesperson for Amazon, said the company vehemently disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling and indicated that there would be an appeal.",
      "\u201cOur team at BHM1 has already made their choice clear, twice that they don\u2019t want a Union. This decision is wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d Paradis said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the NLRB and RWDSU keep trying to force a third vote instead of accepting the facts and the will of our team members.\u201d",
      "With approximately 6,000 employees, Bessemer in 2021 became the largest U.S. facility to vote on unionization in Amazon's over 20-year history. Since then, similar battles have ensued at Amazon facilities across the country.",
      "Workers in Staten Island, New York, successfully voted to unionize in 2022, becoming the first Amazon union in the U.S. But the union has yet to begin bargaining with Amazon amidst legal challenges from the country's second largest employer.",
      "The bid to unionize in Bessemer in particular was always viewed as an uphill battle: Alabama is one of 27 \u201cright-to-work\u201d states where workers don\u2019t have to pay dues to unions that represent them.",
      "Amazon\u2019s sprawling fulfillment center in Bessemer opened in 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic began. The city is more than 70% Black, with about a quarter of its residents living in poverty, according to the United States Census.",
      "A vote will likely be delayed until after the court hears anticipated appeals from both parties.",

      "The collapse of Germany\u2019s governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The collapse of Germany's governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy, already in a troubling decline.",
      "Germany's economy has been shrinking for the past two years in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, war in Ukraine and competition from China. Amid both structural problems at home and global challenges, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's fractious three-party coalition failed to find a way forward on some key issues.",
      "The situation came to a head Wednesday night when Scholz announced he was firing Finance Minister Christian Lindner. The move effectively meant the collapse of the chancellor's coalition, which relied on Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democratic Party, and left the government bereft of a parliamentary majority.",
      "The coalition's breakdown followed weeks of internal disputes over how to boost Germany's ailing economy.",
      "Scholz said he planned to seek a vote of confidence in parliament on Jan. 15, a move that could lead to an early election by the end of March if he loses. Germany's next regularly scheduled election is not until September. In the meantime, he said he would reach out to opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the center-right Christian Democrats to discuss ideas for strengthening the country's economy and defense.",
      "But business leaders called Thursday for Scholz to act much more quickly to produce a stable government that is poised to tackle the crisis.",
      "\u201cEvery additional day with this federal government is a lost day. We demand new elections as soon as possible,\u201d said Dirk Jandura, president of the German wholesale lobby BGA. \u201cGermany needs an economic turnaround. We have to turn the tide before the waves get too high.\u201d",
      "The coalition's collapse came in the final hours of a day in which European leaders began to digest the certainty of another Trump presidency, which will have serious implications for European security and the economy.",
      "\u201cAt the European level, political instability in Germany is not good news,'' Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the Italian think tank ISPI, said, noting that a strong Franco-German alliance at the center of the European Union provided an important counterweight during Trump's first presidency.",
      "Trump has threatened a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also threatened to slap tariffs of up to 20% on goods from the EU, (and even higher tariffs on goods from China), raising the prospect of a trade war with Washington's European allies.",
      "Tariffs would deal a sharp blow to German exports and serve another painful setback to an economy long powered by cheap and plentiful energy from Russia and large export markets.",
      "German industry still has not fully recovered from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then came Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led Germany and other Western countries to cut themselves off from Russian gas and oil. Competition from China, including its electric vehicles, has meanwhile forced German and other and European carmakers to lower production and lay off workers.",
      "\u201cPolitical developments over the last 24 hours have further darkened the already bleak short-term outlook for the German economy,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch banking firm ING, said.",
      "\u201cA second term in office for Donald Trump in the U.S., with the expected new trade tensions, will hit the German economy, which has 10% of its exports going into the U.S.,\" Brzeski said in a note published Thursday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a lot of imagination to see U.S. tariffs on European cars sending the German automotive industry into deeper problems.\u201d",
      "Other analysts say Trump\u2019s embrace of tariffs might actually benefit Germany\u2019s automobile industry, whose woes have been one of the reasons for the weakening economy. While Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on European products, President Joe Biden already placed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles vehicles, which are flooding the global market.",
      "\u201cTrump can save the German automotive sector\u201d by keeping the tariffs on Chinese EVs, said Daniel Gros, director of the Institute for European Policymaking at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. \u201cThe United States is the only market in the world where German carmakers don\u2019t encounter much competition from China.\u201d",
      "Last month, Volkswagen said it planned to close at least three factories in Germany, the first domestic closures in its 87-year history.",
      "\"Some factories will have to close, but perhaps fewer,'' Gros said.",
      "Scholz's firing of the finance minister came after his center-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist, left-leaning Greens had discussed plans for massive state investments. The Free Democrats, however, rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of refusing to find common ground on economic issues, including by publicly calling for what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all recipients.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent, that is not fair,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u2019s Greens and Lindner\u2019s Free Democrats, a party that in recent decades was mostly allied with conservatives, set out in 2021 to form an ambitious, progressive coalition straddling ideological divisions that would modernize Germany.",
      "The government can point to achievements: preventing an energy crunch after Russia cut off its gas supplies to Germany, initiating the modernization of the military and a series of social reforms. But the impression it has left with many Germans is of deepening dysfunction.",
      "\u201cIn view of the global political situation and the poor economic development of Germany as a location, we now need a new, capable government with its own parliamentary majority as quickly as possible,\" said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the Federation of German Industries.",
      "\"With the inauguration of the new U.S. government at the beginning of 2025, uncertainty is expected to increase,\u201d Russwurm said.",

      "The drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures helped magnify the floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain's meteorological agency says that 30.4 inches fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis, an all-time national record for rainfall set on Oct. 29. The devastated village of Chiva also received more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months.",
      "The storms honed in on the Magro and Turia Rivers and the Poyo canal, turning them into swift currents that swept away everything in their path. To the human eye, it looked as if a tsunami-like wave of water and mud cut a swath through the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia.",
      "The European Space Agency said that, according to satellite images captured on Oct. 31, water covered an area of 15,633 hectares (38,600 acres). About 190,000 people were directly affected, the agency said.",

      "The Federal Reserve cut its key rate by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week.",
      "The rate cut follows a larger half-point reduction in September, and it reflects the Fed\u2019s renewed focus on supporting the job market as well as fighting inflation, which now barely exceeds the central bank\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Asked at a news conference how Trump's election might affect the Fed's policymaking, Chair Jerome Powell said that \"in the near term, the election will have no effects on our (interest rate) decisions.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s election, beyond its economic consequences, has raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed\u2019s policy decisions. Trump has argued that as president, he should have a voice in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. The Fed has long guarded its role as an independent agency able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet in his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again.",
      "Asked whether he would resign if Trump asked him to, Powell, who will have a year left in his second four-year term as Fed chair when Trump takes office, replied simply, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "And Powell said that in his view, Trump could not fire or demote him: It would \u201cnot be permitted under the law,\u201d he said.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Fed rate cut reduced its benchmark rate to about 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%. The Fed had kept its rate that high for more than a year to fight the worst inflation streak in four decades. Annual inflation has since fallen from a 9.1% peak in mid-2022 to a 3 1/2-year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "When its latest policy meeting ended Thursday, the Fed issued a statement noting that the \"unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\u201d and while inflation has fallen closer to the 2% target level, it \u201cremains somewhat elevated.\u201d",
      "After their rate cut in September \u2014 their first such move in more than four years \u2014 the policymakers had projected that they would make further quarter-point cuts in November and December and four more next year. But with the economy now mostly solid and Wall Street anticipating faster growth, larger budget deficits and higher inflation under a Trump presidency, further rate cuts may have become less likely. Rate cuts by the Fed typically lead over time to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "Powell declined to be pinned down Thursday on whether the Fed would proceed with an additional quarter-point rate cut in December or the four rate cuts its policymakers penciled in for 2025.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting giant KPMG, said she thought Powell was reluctant to provide hints about the Fed\u2019s next moves because of the uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s election victory.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not willing to go too far out ahead of his skis, given how much could change,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an environment where you don\u2019t know how promises on the campaign trail translate to actual policies, you don\u2019t want to front-run it.\u201d",
      "Still, Matthew Luzzetti, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said there were signs that the Fed might end up announcing fewer rate cuts next year than many economists expect. The job market and the economy are looking healthier than they appeared in September, when the Fed announced an outsize half-point rate cut.",
      "\u201cNothing in the economic data,\u201d Luzzetti said, \u201csuggests that the (Fed) has any need to be in a hurry\u201d to get rates down substantially.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Powell did express confidence that inflation, despite some recent higher-than-expected readings, would keep falling back to the Fed\u2019s target.",
      "\u201cWe feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years, and settling around 2%,\u201d he said.",
      "The economy is clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Consumer spending, though, has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation.",
      "Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed\u2019s half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting.",
      "Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. Trump\u2019s plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump\u2019s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026.",
      "The economy grew at a solid annual rate just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending \u2014 fueled by higher-income shoppers \u2014 rose strongly in the July-September quarter.",
      "But companies have scaled back hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. If economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, though, the central bank will come under pressure to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "Asked at his news conference about Americans who are feeling little relief from the pain of high prices and who helped fuel Trump\u2019s victory, Powell said:",
      "\u201cIt takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to create, and I think we\u2019re well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down, the economy is still strong here, wages are moving up, but at a sustainable level.",
      "\u201cI think what needs to happen is happening, and for the most part has happened, but it will be some time before people regain their confidence and feel that.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said."

      "A man charged with fraud for claiming to own a storied Manhattan hotel where he had been living rent-free for years has been found unfit to stand trial",
      "NEW YORK -- A man charged with fraud for claiming to own a storied Manhattan hotel where he had been living rent-free for years has been found unfit to stand trial, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "Doctors examining Mickey Barreto deemed he's not mentally competent to face criminal charges, and prosecutors confirmed the results during a court hearing Wednesday, according to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.",
      "Judge Cori Weston gave Barreto until Nov. 13. to find suitable inpatient psychiatric care, Bragg's office said.",
      "Barreto had been receiving outpatient treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues, but doctors concluded after a recent evaluation that he did not fully understand the criminal proceedings, the New York Times first reported.",
      "Barreto dismissed the allegations of a drug problem to some \u201cpartying,\u201d and said prosecutors are trying to have him hospitalized because they did not have a strong case against him. He does see some upside.",
      "\u201cIt went from being unfriendly, \u2018He\u2019s a criminal,\u2019 to oh, they don\u2019t talk about crime anymore. Now the main thing is, like, \u2018Oh, poor thing. Finally, we convinced him to go seek treatment,\u2019\u201d Barreto told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "Brian Hutchinson, an attorney for Barreto, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. But during Wednesday's hearing, he said he planned to ask his client's current treatment provider to accept him, the Times reported.",
      "In February, prosecutors charged Barreto with 24 counts, including felony fraud and criminal contempt.",
      "They say he forged a deed to the New Yorker Hotel purporting to transfer ownership of the entire building to him.",
      "He then tried to charge one of the hotel's tenants rent and demanded the hotel\u2019s bank transfer its accounts to him, among other steps.",
      "Barreto started living at the hotel in 2018 after arguing in court that he had paid about $200 for a one-night stay and therefore had tenant\u2019s rights, based on a quirk of the city's housing laws and the fact that the hotel failed to send a lawyer to a key hearing.",
      "Barreto has said he lived at the hotel without paying any rent because the building\u2019s owners, the Unification Church, never wanted to negotiate a lease with him, but they also couldn\u2019t legally kick him out.",
      "Now, his criminal case may be steering him toward a sort of loophole.",
      "\u201cSo if you ask me if it\u2019s a better thing, in a way it is. Because I\u2019m not being treated as a criminal but I\u2019m treated like a nutjob,\u201d Barreto told the AP.",
      "Built in 1930, the hulking Art Deco structure and its huge red \u201cNew Yorker\u201d sign is an oft-photographed landmark in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Muhammad Ali and other famous boxers stayed there when they had bouts at nearby Madison Square Garden, about a block away. Inventor Nikola Tesla even lived in one of its more than 1,000 rooms for a decade. And NBC broadcasted from its Terrace Room.",
      "But the New Yorker closed as a hotel in 1972 and was used for years for church purposes before part of the building reopened as a hotel in 1994."

      "Nissan now expects to sell 3.4 million vehicles around the world in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, down from an earlier projected 3.65 million vehicles. The new number is about the same that Nissan sold last fiscal year.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:06:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% on Thursday after inflation across the U.K. fell significantly, relieving some pressure on borrowers who have faced elevated mortgage and loan costs.",
      "The bank said eight of the nine members of its rate-setting panel backed the reduction \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 while one opted to keep borrowing costs on hold. The latest cut comes after inflation in the U.K. fell to an annual rate of 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Though inflation has fallen below the bank's target of 2%, Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned that interest rates would not be falling too fast over coming months, partly because last week's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here.\u201d",
      "He added that it's very unlikely that interest rates will fall to the very low levels that persisted in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008. During the coronavirus pandemic, which erupted in early 2020, interest rates around the world fell to zero, or just above zero in the case of the Bank of England.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to cut interest rates later Thursday.",
      "Economists have warned that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "\u201cEven though interest rates have further to fall, the upward pressure on inflation from the budget and growing global risks, including possible new U.S. tariffs, could mean that policy is loosened more modestly than many anticipated,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",
      "The decision comes a week after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "Rate-setters considered the budget measures during their deliberations and concluded they would likely boost growth by 0.75 percentage points and inflation by 0.5 percentage points over the coming year.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "Bailey said it was \u201cnot useful or wise to enter into speculation\u201d about what policies might be introduced by the incoming Trump administration and that the Bank of England only factors in policies that have already been announced when it compiles its economic projections.",

      "Alex Ovechkin scored his 130th career game-winning goal to keep his hot streak going, the Washington Capitals winning and the Nashville Predators losing",
      "WASHINGTON -- Alex Ovechkin scoring to hand the Nashville Predators another defeat and keep his Washington Capitals rolling was not surprising to the folks on the other side who have seen him a lot over the years.",
      "\u201cYou knew it was coming,\u201d said Predators coach Andrew Brunette, whose final seven seasons as a player overlapped with Ovechkin's first seven in the NHL. \"You\u2019re on the bench and I guess I\u2019ve seen him too many times. I\u2019ve played against him, I\u2019ve coached against him, I\u2019ve watched him and he just finds that and when it\u2019s on his stick it\u2019s gone.",

      "Ovechkin is now six away from breaking Jaromir Jagr's record for the most career game-winning goals. His 130th helped the Capitals improve to 9-3-0 this season and sent the Predators to their ninth loss in 13 games.",
      "\u201cIt (stinks) that he scored against us tonight and got the game-winner, but a guy that is still producing at this age is impressive,\u201d said Predators forward Steven Stamkos, who played his first 16 years in the league with Tampa Bay. \u201cTo keep doing it at this age is very impressive.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin has six goals in his past five games to reach 861 for his career. He's 34 away from breaking Wayne Gretzky's career mark that for decades had seemed unapproachable.",
      "Washington's longtime captain also became just the third player age 39 or older to score in five or more consecutive games, after Johnny Bucyk in 1974 and Brett Hull in 2003.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to go down as the guy with the most goals ever at some point here,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a generational goal scorer and a guy that I\u2019ve always looked up to in terms of how he scores goals. It\u2019s the hardest thing to do in the NHL is score and he\u2019s found a way to do it better than \u2014 soon \u2014 anyone ever.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin also continued his streak of scoring every game the Capitals wear their black \u201cScreaming Eagle\u201d jersey, on this occasion the first time in this, their 50th season. The player known as the \u201cGreat Eight\u201d is now 8 for 8 in this uniform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know the stats, but I love this jersey,\" Ovechkin said. \"Fans love it, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin set up Aliaksei Protas earlier in the game, too, and has eight goals and eight assists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always having fun,\" Ovechkin said. \"But when you're winning games, when you're producing opportunities to have a chance to score goals, it\u2019s always fun to play.\u201d",

      "Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways.",
      "Athletic director Scott Stricklin made the announcement in a \u201cletter to Gator Nation\u201d on Thursday that said the team is \u201cbuilding a foundation that promises greater success next season and beyond.\u201d",
      "The letter does not specicially mention the 2025 season, but a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press that the intent was to send a message of stability for next year, not just the upcoming recruiting season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Florida's internal discussions are private.",
      "\u201cI wanted to let you know that Billy Napier will continue as head football coach of the Florida Gators,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen these past several weeks, the young men on this team represent what it means to be a Gator. Their resolve, effort and execution are evident in their performance and growth each week \u2014 building a foundation that promises greater success next season and beyond.\u201d",
      "The Gators (4-4, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) have made significant strides since lopsided losses to Miami and Texas A&M during the first month of the season. Napier shored up the team's shaky defense, found a potential star in freshman quarterback DJ Lagway and developed young talent on both sides of the ball.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of progress that should help Stricklin's case to keep Napier despite his 15-18 record heading into Saturday's game at No. 5 Texas.",
      "\u201cUF's commitment to excellence and a championship-caliber program is unwavering,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cIn these times of change across college athletics, we are dedicated to a disciplined, stable approach that is focused on long-term, sustained success for Gator athletes, recruits and fans. I am confident that Billy will meet the challenges and opportunities ahead.\u201d",
      "The Gators went toe-to-toe with then-No. 8 Tennessee in Knoxville last month and again with second-ranked Georgia last week in Jacksonville.",
      "Florida lost 23-17 in overtime to the Volunteers after squandering several chances to pull off a stunner. And there are plenty who believe the Gators would have beaten Georgia had Lagway not pulled his hamstring in the second quarter while leading 10-3.",
      "\u201cBefore the season started, nobody expected us to be anything,\" running back Ja'Kobi Jackson said Wednesday. \"But we\u2019re proving to people day-in and day-out that we can play in the SEC, that we\u2019re capable of beating teams.\u201d",
      "No one saw that coming in September, and it appeared Napier might not make it through the first month of the season.",
      "Florida was inept on both sides of the ball in a 41-17 loss to rival Miami to open the season and showed no improvement in a 33-20 loss to Texas A&M two weeks later.",
      "But Napier\u2019s popularity started to turn with a dominant victory at Mississippi State and then a bye week that became a series of ultra-competitive practices \u2014 on-field work that players point to as the key to getting on track.",
      "While some wondered if the Gators would start giving up or opting out, they dug in for Napier.",
      "\u201cEverything Coach Napier says, everybody\u2019s bought into it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for each other at the end of the day. We play for everyone that\u2019s in this building.\"",
      "Florida would owe Napier roughly $26 million by firing him in 2024. His buyout drops to around $19 million in 2025, although that figure would be considerably higher with his legion of assistants and behind-the-scenes help.",
      "Even with Napier remaining in place, staff changes are expected. And he's still likely to open next year on the proverbial hot seat \u2014 and for good reason.",
      "Florida is 2-12 against ranked teams and 1-10 against rivals Florida State, Georgia, LSU, Miami and Tennessee. And Napier\u2019s in-game mistakes continue to mount (see Tennessee), although at a much slower pace.",
      "Nonetheless, growth outweighs growing pains. And with November being a key recruiting month, Florida administrators opted to give Napier a vote of confidence, especially with his team so banged up. The Gators could be down their top two quarterbacks, including Lagway, their top two running backs, two of their top four receivers and four cornerbacks when they take the field in Austin.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Billy will meet the challenges and opportunities ahead,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cNow, I call on all of Gator Nation to continue standing behind Billy and his dedicated team while we work together to build a championship program.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- A remarkable era of parity in Major League Baseball hit a bit of a snag this October when the big-spending New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets finished as three of the top four teams in this year's postseason.",
      "Sometimes, all that money really is an advantage.",
      "Now it's time for the sport's middle-sized and small-market franchises to look for ways to counter during this offseason. Given several factors \u2014 particularly cash flow uncertainty due to the collapse of the regional sports network model \u2014 that could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be a challenge for Major League Baseball leadership,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said on Wednesday. \u201cHow do you remain with some level of competitive balance when there are so many teams that have so much higher revenues than the lower end?\u201d",
      "The fact that the Cardinals are worried about their financial future should be fairly alarming. This is a franchise that's been among baseball's most consistent over the past several decades, winning World Series titles in 2006 and 2011. They may not spend like the Dodgers, Yankees or Mets, but they've usually had reasonably deep pockets.",
      "\u201cWe've always punched above our weight, so to speak,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cBut now we're having the realization that we're going to be affected from our media package, our ticket sales, so our reality is changing.\u201d",
      "The Cardinals' dilemma is one shared by several other teams. MLB announced in October it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.",
      "The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.",
      "The addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025. The Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres were the first three to make the switch.",
      "MLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "The Cardinals reached a new media rights on Thursday, though financial terms were not disclosed. They are one of five teams that are part owners of their regional sports network, along with the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins. The stations are FanDuel Sports Network affiliates after Diamond reached a naming rights deal with FanDuel last month.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has remained bullish about the long-term financial prospects of all 30 teams, but has also acknowledged that there might be some short-term pain as the transition continues.",
      "D-backs general manager Mike Hazen has always believed that a lower payroll is no excuse for poor performance. Arizona advanced to the World Series in 2023 despite having ranked No. 21 in the league in that category.",
      "The team spent more last offseason thanks to postseason revenue, rising to the middle of the MLB pack. He said his team is ready to be active in free agency once again, even if he conceded that there are challenges.",
      "\u201cObviously, it builds in some sort of uncertainty for us, but we get with (ownership) and figure out what we have to spend, what we can add and then we act accordingly,\u201d Hazen said.",
      "The Mets ($332 million), Yankees ($311 million) and Dodgers ($266 million) had the top three payrolls in baseball last season, though those numbers will change slightly this winter when bonuses are calculated. The Guardians ranked No. 23 at $109 million. Unlike the NFL, NBA and NHL, baseball does not have a salary cap.",
      "As the Guardians showed, it's not impossible to go deep into the playoffs with a modest payroll. But it's not easy and it's not getting any easier.",
      "\u201cYou have to scratch and claw and match up and make moves, take shots and hope that it works,\u201d Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said last month. \u201cWhereas for the other three teams, for the majorities, they set their lineup and go play.\u201d",
      "Not everyone believes that MLB teams are suffering much financial hardship. Baseball super agent Scott Boras called the regional sports network uncertainty \u201clast year's news\u201d and doesn't believe it will have much affect on the free agent market this winter.",
      "\u201cClubs have been offered contracts from RSNs and they've rejected them, they're building their own platforms, they're using different methods for streaming,\u201d Boras said. \"You've seen it with Texas, Milwaukee. They're offered money but they feel they can do better with other elements.",
      "\u201cThat should tell you about their evolution of thought \u2014 how they feel going forward with streaming.\u201d",

      "Where academics rates as a priority varies with each individual. But several Division I athletes said in interviews the money available to them through NIL remains a small consideration compared with earning a degree and competing in the sports they love.",
      "Anthony Leal, a guard for Indiana University's basketball team, said he is coming back as a fifth-year senior because of school, even though he received his undergraduate degree last year. He said earning a master's in business administration was always the goal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about 70% through the program in the Kelley School of Business,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get that degree.\u201d",
      "NCAA eligibility rules allow athletes five years to compete athletically across four seasons. Under the redshirt eligibility rule, many receive an athletic scholarship and practice their first year, but do not compete in games or matches. The NCAA also allowed athletes to extend their eligibility by a year if their team was affected by the pandemic.",
      "For some athletes, NIL money is an incentive to attend and stay in college, but Leal said it's not often that athletes are completely disinterested in school.",
      "\u201cEvery student knows that it has to be a piece of the puzzle at some level. So everyone kind of understands the value of school,\u201d Leal said. \u201cBut, yeah, sure, some people may have other goals. There are plenty of people, maybe not at Indiana, but there are plenty of people throughout college basketball who don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve got NIL (money) and the transfer portal.\u201d",
      "The transfer portal has become a plug-and-play method for powerhouses and rebuilding programs alike. It has made it easy for athletes to switch colleges and play the next season, rather than sitting out a year under previous rules. And it has become a way for top athletes to shop around for more lucrative opportunities. UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka, for one, walked away from the team in a dispute over a $100,000 NIL payment his agent says was promised but never paid.",
      "The NIL market is expected to reach $1.67 billion in the 2024-2025 school year, according to an estimate by the NIL platform Opendorse. The highest earnings go to top men's basketball and football players.",
      "Even though the NCAA now allows players to transfer without sitting out, the academic transition can be more complicated.",
      "Ray Harrison started at Presbyterian College in 2020, but transferred in 2022 to Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university in Phoenix where he is a senior guard on the basketball team. He said NIL money wasn't a factor. It was about finding a better fit for him.",
      "\u201cI just came out here because this is where God led my heart. Of course, we win two (conference) championships and that changes things,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t a smooth transition \u2014 a lot of his course credits didn\u2019t transfer. \u201cWhen I got here, I had to do some catching up.\u201d",
      "Trinity San Antonio, another student who transferred to Grand Canyon, previously attended California Baptist, a private university in Riverside, California. Finding a school that would accept the majority of her previously earned college credits was harder than she expected.",
      "\u201cComing in as a freshman when you\u2019re really a junior is not ideal,\u201d said San Antonio, who also played basketball for Puerto Rico last summer in the Paris Olympics.",
      "A shot at a college education remains a dream for many younger athletes.",
      "Tavarius Covington, a wide receiver on his high school football team in Chicago, has ambitions of playing in college. But he said his priority is school. He hopes to pursue a business degree.",
      "Covington took a break from football but came back to it last year, hoping it would help him become the first in his family to go to college and earn a degree, he said.",
      "\u201cI was watching my little brother play. We were going to his games and the family was excited for him. It made me interested in the game again,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of it is trying to establish a foundation for him, too, as a first-generation college student, hopefully. I want him to know there is more to look forward to coming out of high school.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 03:14:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The NCAA Division I Council has cleared the way for players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season",
    "story": [
      "The NCAA Division I Council has cleared the way for players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season",
      "The NCAA Division I Council approved a rule Thursday allowing players with Canadian Hockey League experience to compete at U.S. colleges starting next season, a landmark decision that has the potential of shaking up the NHL\u2019s two largest sources of developmental talent.",
      "The decision, effective Aug. 1, lifts the NCAA\u2019s longstanding ban on CHL players who were previously deemed to be professionals because they received a stipend of up to $600 per month for living expenses.",
      "The approval was expected after the council introduced a proposal to lift the ban last month. Players competing at the major junior level or on professional teams can retain NCAA eligibility as long as they are not paid more than actual and necessary expenses.",
      "The decision also applies to skiing, bringing both in line with NCAA eligibility rules for other sports",
      "In doing so, the council opened the door for a major change in how players approaching their 16th birthdays decide where to play. Rather than having to choose between one or the other, CHL players can now play NCAA hockey when they become college eligible.",
      "\u201cEveryone expected the rule to change. Now we will have to adapt,\" Central Collegiate Hockey Association Commissioner Don Lucia wrote in a text to The Associated Press. \"There may be a few issues as we transition. But hopefully, in time, it will prove to be a positive change for all involved.\u201d",
      "NHL agent Allan Walsh called the ruling a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis revolutionary development is great news for young players and their families, who will no longer be faced with the momentous decision of playing major junior or going the NCAA route,\u201d Walsh added in a text message to The AP. \u201cThe young players and their families can now make decisions based on what\u2019s best for them, not what\u2019s best for the CHL or NCAA.\u201d",
      "The CHL oversees the Western Hockey, Ontario Hockey and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey leagues.",
      "The decision could potentially spur the CHL to invest more toward player development and education to compete with the NCAA teams or risk losing its top 18-and-older talent to U.S. colleges. Meantime, an increase of CHL players could eat up college roster spots previously filled by Americans.",
      "One option the CHL is considering in response to the ruling is increasing its current limit of two non-North American import players per roster. Otherwise, the CHL called the decision \u201ca positive development\u201d in providing players more athletic and academic opportunities.",
      "The NCAA\u2019s ruling follows a class-action lawsuit filed Aug. 13 in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York, challenging the ban.",
      "\u201cIt's long overdue, but this is a great result,\u201d Stephen Lagos, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to players and fans seeing the benefits of a more competitive and fair market, without the rule, beginning next season.\u201d",
      "Lagos said the attorneys will continue pursuing the lawsuit in seeking damages for players who join the class-action case affected by the ban dating to Aug. 12, 2020.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Riley Masterson of Fort Erie, Ontario, who lost his college eligibility two years ago when, at 16, he appeared in two exhibition games for the OHL\u2019s Windsor Spitfires. It lists 10 Division I hockey programs, which were selected to show they follow the NCAA\u2019s bylaws in barring current or former CHL players.",
      "NHL agent Brian Bartlett hailed the decision for opening choices for players.",
      "\u201cJust like the transfer portal and NIL rule changes of recent years, there will be some growing pains and early chaos, but we expect it will be a positive development in the long term,\u201d Bartlett wrote in a text. \u201cWith a larger player pool, hopefully more NCAA schools will consider adding hockey programs to provide opportunities for those additional players.\u201d",
      "In September, Braxton Whitehead said he had verbally committed to Arizona State, making him the first CHL player to attempt to play hockey at the Division I U.S. college level. The 20-year-old Whitehead said he plans to play this season for the WHL Regina Pats before playing for the Sun Devils in 2025-26.",
      "The stipends CHL players receive are not considered as income for tax purposes. College players, meantime, receive scholarships and now can earn money through endorsements and other use of their name, image or likeness.",
      "The eligibility change could have a trickle down effect by impacting Canada's various junior A leagues and the USHL's ability to attract talent for those pursuing plans to play at U.S. colleges. Two recent NHL No. 1 draft picks, San Jose forward Macklin Celebrini and Buffalo defenseman Owen Power, played in the USHL.",
      "\u201cThe USHL remains the world\u2019s premier development path. All aspects of the league are focused on preparing athletes for collegiate and professional hockey, inclusive of on-ice, academic and character development,\u201d the USHL said in a statement after the NCAA ruling.",

      "Don Bosseler, an All-American fullback who led Miami to the No. 6 ranking in The Associated Press poll in 1956 and was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame, has died, his family and the National Football Foundation announced",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Don Bosseler, an All-American fullback who led Miami to the No. 6 ranking in The Associated Press poll in 1956 and was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame, has died, his family and the National Football Foundation announced Thursday. He was 88.",
      "Bosseler, who played eight years in the NFL, died Wednesday in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cDon Bosseler\u2019s talents helped the Miami football program achieve national prominence in the 1950s,\u201d National Football Foundation Chairman Archie Manning said in a release. \u201cAn All-American, he epitomized toughness, earning the nickname \u2018Bull,\u2019 and you can still find his name in the records books at the \u2018U\u2019 nearly 70 years later.\u201d",
      "Bosseler was a first-round selection by Washington in 1957, drafted ninth overall that year, and rushed for 3,112 yards and 22 touchdowns in eight NFL seasons. He made the Pro Bowl in 1959.",
      "Among those taken ahead of Bosseler in that 1957 draft: No. 1 pick Paul Hornung and No. 6 pick Jim Brown. Bosseler called them both after the draft to ask what they signed for, then secured a $10,000 contract with a $500 signing bonus from Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd in typical Don Bosseler fashion, he came home with that $500 and spent it all with his University of Miami teammate friends in one night,\u201d his son, Greg Bosseler, said Thursday. \u201cI think they had a good time.\u201d",
      "Don Bosseler played his high school football in Batavia, New York, near Buffalo, and was heavily recruited. He chose Miami, but nearly left after a couple weeks because he was homesick. He packed his bags and headed to the train station.",
      "His roommate, fellow running back Don Dorshimer, called Miami coach Andy Gustafson with a message. \u201cBosseler's on the loose,\u201d Dorshimer said. Gustafson raced out of his house, got to the train station, found Bosseler and pleaded with him to come back for just one more day.",
      "\u201cAnd the rest is history,\u201d Greg Bosseler said.",
      "The bags got unpacked. Bosseler led the team in rushing as a junior and senior, was a first-team AP All-American in 1956, picked as the outstanding player in Florida and was MVP of the Senior Bowl. One of his finest games was against the Florida Gators in 1956, when he led Miami to a 20-7 win.",
      "\u201cThe Batavia, N.Y. bulldozer raced up 148 yards on the ground \u2014 23 yards more than the entire Gator team \u2014 scored two touchdowns, intercepted one pass, recovered one fumble, was impregnable on defense and quick kicked once for 47 yards,\u201d Fort Lauderdale News sports editor Joe Kolb wrote that day. \u201cIs that All-America, or isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "Greg Bosseler wound up going to Florida and playing football for the Gators. Don Bosseler respected the decision, and father and son shared some laughs about it over the years.",
      "\u201cI was not anywhere near as talented as my father,\u201d Greg Bosseler said.",
      "After football, Don Bosseler kept Miami as his home until the final years of his life when he moved to Atlanta. He was a successful stockbroker, went into the Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1970 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1990. His name is also part of the Hurricanes' ring of honor.",
      "\u201cAfter all this time, that people still recognize the name is certainly a treasured gift for all of us at this point,\u201d Greg Bosseler said. \"My dad was my hero.\u201d",

      "A person with knowledge of the situation says Dak Prescott\u2019s injured hamstring is partially torn away from the bone and surgery for the star quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys is possible",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Dak Prescott's injured hamstring is partially torn away from the bone and surgery for the star quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys is possible, a person with knowledge of the situation said Thursday.",
      "The injury, known as a partial avulsion, is likely to lead to an absence longer than the minimum of four games that would be required by putting Prescott on injured reserve.",
      "Potentially season-ending surgery is among the options being considered, the person told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team hasn't disclosed details of Prescott's injury publicly. NFL Network was the first to report the extent of Prescott's injury.",
      "In training camp two years ago, former Cowboys left tackle Tyron Smith sustained what is called a full avulsion, a complete tear of the hamstring off the bone that requires surgery, and missed 13 games.",
      "Prescott was injured in the second half of the Cowboys' 27-21 loss to Atlanta on Sunday. Dallas (3-5) is preparing for Cooper Rush to start multiple games, beginning Sunday at home against NFC East rival Philadelphia.",
      "Rush went 4-1 filling in two years ago after Prescott broke the thumb on his throwing hand in a season-opening loss. He also won a game in 2021 when Prescott was out with a strained calf.",
      "The Cowboys have made the playoffs three consecutive years with a 12-5 record, but have already matched that loss total and are three games behind Washington and the Eagles in the loss column in the NFC East.",
      "If Prescott doesn't return, it will be the second time in five years the 2016 AP Offensive Rookie of the Year has been sidelined most of the season. He broke an ankle in Week 5 of the 2020 season and missed 11 games.",

      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "Forty-three monkeys escaped from a compound used for medical research in South Carolina but the nearby police chief said there is \"almost no danger\u201d to the public.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website. The company did not respond to an email asking about Wednesday's escape.",
      "In 2018, federal officials fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 after dozens of primates escaped as well as for an incident that left a few others without water and other problems with how the monkeys were housed.",
      "Officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

    "story": [
      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Racist text messages invoking slavery raised alarm across the country this week after they were sent to Black men, women and students, including middle schoolers, prompting inquiries by the FBI and other agencies.",
      "The messages, sent anonymously, were reported in several states, including New York, Alabama, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. They generally used a similar tone but varied in wording.",
      "Some instructed the recipient to show up at an address at a particular time \u201cwith your belongings,\u201d while others didn't include a location. Some of them mentioned the incoming presidential administration.",
      "It wasn't yet clear who was behind the messages and there was no comprehensive list of where they were sent, but high school and college students were among the recipients.",
      "The FBI said it was in touch with the Justice Department on the messages, and the Federal Communications Commission said it was investigating the texts \u201calongside federal and state law enforcement.\u201d The Ohio Attorney General's office also said it was looking into the matter.",
      "Tasha Dunham of Lodi, California, said her 16-year-old daughter showed her one of the messages Wednesday evening before her basketball practice.",
      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",
      "\u201cIt was very disturbing,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just trying to figure out what does this all mean for me? So, I definitely had a lot of fear and concern.\u201d",
      "Her daughter initially thought it was a prank, but emotions are high following Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Dunham and her family thought it could be more nefarious and reported it to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in slavery. My mother wasn't in slavery. But we\u2019re a couple of generations away. So, when you think about how brutal and awful slavery was for our people, it\u2019s awful and concerning,\u201d Dunham said.",
      "About six middle school students in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received the messages too, said Megan Shafer, acting superintendent of the Lower Merion School District.",
      "\u201cThe racist nature of these text messages is extremely disturbing, made even more so by the fact that children have been targeted,\u201d she wrote in a letter to parents.",
      "Students at some major universities, including Clemson in South Carolina and the University of Alabama, said they received the messages. The Clemson Police Department said in a statement that it had been notified of the \u201cdeplorable racially motivated text and email messages\u201d and encouraged anyone who received one to report it.",
      "Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement calling the messages that targeted some of its students \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d It urged calm and assured students that the texts likely were from bots or malicious actors with \u201cno real intentions or credibility.\u201d",
      "Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel said Black students who are members of the organization's Missouri State University chapter received texts citing Trump\u2019s win and calling them out by name as being \u201cselected to pick cotton\u201d next Tuesday. Chapel said police in the southeastern Missouri city of Springfield, home of the university, have been notified.",
      "\u201cIt points to a well-organized and resourced group that has decided to target Americans on our home soil based on the color of our skin,\u201d Chapel said in a statement.",
      "Nick Ludlum, a senior vice president for the wireless industry trade group CTIA, said: \u201cWireless providers are aware of these threatening spam messages and are aggressively working to block them and the numbers that they are coming from.\u201d",
      "David Brody, director of the Digital Justice Initiative at The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that they aren\u2019t sure who is behind the messages but estimated they had been sent to more than 10 states, including most Southern states, Maryland, Oklahoma and even the District of Columbia. The district's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement that its intelligence unit was investigating the origins of the message.",
      "Brody said a number of civil rights laws can be applied to hate-related incidents. The leaders of several other civil rights organizations condemned the messages, including Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who said, \u201cHate speech has no place in the South or our nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe threat \u2014 and the mention of slavery in 2024 \u2014 is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \u201cThese actions are not normal.

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "The explosions in mid-September were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The blasts killed at least 37 people, including two children, wounded more than 3,000 and deeply unsettled even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation.",
      "Lebanese Labor Minister Moustafa Bayram said he traveled to Geneva to formally file the complaint against Israel at the International Labor Organization, a sprawling U.N. agency that brings together governments, businesses and workers.",

      "NEW YORK -- Shares of Tesla soared Wednesday as investors bet that the electric vehicle maker and its CEO Elon Musk will benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",
      "Tesla shares jumped 14.8% Wednesday while shares of rival electric vehicle makers tumbled. Nio, based in Shanghai, fell 5.3%. Shares of electric truck maker Rivian dropped 8.3% and Lucid Group fell 5.3%.",
      "Tesla dominates sales of electric vehicles in the U.S, with 48.9% in market share through the middle of 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Subsidies for clean energy are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. It included tax credits for manufacturing, along with tax credits for consumers of electric vehicles.",
      "Musk was one of Trump\u2019s biggest donors, spending at least $119 million mobilizing Trump\u2019s supporters to back the Republican nominee. He also pledged to give away $1 million a day to voters signing a petition for his political action committee.",
      "In some ways, it has been a rocky year for Tesla, with sales and profit declining through the first half of the year. Profit did rise 17.3% in the third quarter.",
      "The U.S. opened an investigation into the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system after reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian. The investigation covers roughly 2.4 million Teslas from the 2016 through 2024 model years.",
      "And investors sent company shares tumbling last month after Tesla unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night, seeing not much progress at Tesla on autonomous vehicles while other companies have been making notable progress.",
      "Tesla began selling the software, which is called \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d nine years ago. But there are doubts about its reliability.",
      "The stock is now showing a 16.1% gain for the year after rising the past two days."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s privacy watchdog on Tuesday fined social media company Meta 21.6 billion won ($15 million) for illegally collecting sensitive personal information from Facebook users, including data about their political views and sexual orientation, and sharing it with thousands of advertisers.",
      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved.",
      "The commission said Meta amassed sensitive information by analyzing the pages the Facebook users liked or the advertisements they clicked on.",
      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",
      "Meta\u2019s South Korean office said it would \u201ccarefully review\u201d the commission\u2019s decision, but didn\u2019t immediately provide more comment.",
      "In 2022, the commission fined Google and Meta a combined 100 billion won ($72 million) for tracking consumers\u2019 online behavior without their consent and using their data for targeted advertisements, in the biggest penalties ever imposed in South Korea for privacy law violations.",
      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",
      "The commission also hit Meta with a 6.7 billion won ($4.8 million) fine in 2020 for providing personal information about itsx users to third parties without consent."

      "Trump Media and Technology Group reported late Tuesday that much of that loss stemmed from more than $12 million in legal fees, along with a decline in revenue, according to the surprise Election Day earnings report.

      "It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms. But school administrators in one South Florida county working to pull students\u2019 eyes away from their screens are facing some resistance from another group as well \u2013 parents.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2024 school year in August, students in Broward County Public Schools, the country\u2019s sixth largest district, have been barred from using cellphones during the school day, including during lunch and breaks, unless given special permission.",
      "The schools are some of the many across the country wrestling with how to crack down on cellphones, at a time when experts say social media use among young people is nearly universal \u2013 and that screen time is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression among kids.",
      "But a survey sent out by the South Florida school district earlier this fall found that of the more than 70,000 students, teachers and parents surveyed, nearly one in five parents believe the cellphone ban is having a negative impact on their student\u2019s wellbeing.",
      "Among the top concerns for the students and parents surveyed is not being able to communicate with their family members, especially in an emergency \u2014 an anxiety that cuts deep in the district that\u2019s home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a 2018 shooting killed 17 people.",
      "District officials have said students can use their phones during an emergency and that teachers have the flexibility to grant kids access for other reasons too.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thinks kids should be on their phones during class,\u201d said Erin Gohl, a parent and advocate in the district.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about giving kids tools during those times when they need it,\u201d she added, including letting students use their phones for \u201cpositive mental health purposes\u201d.",
      "Officials in the Fort Lauderdale-area district have acknowledged that implementation of the policy has been inconsistent. Some teachers have struggled to monitor students\u2019 phone use, and are facing the reality that for some kids, phones can be a needed tool to access online lessons and turn in assignments, especially for those who don\u2019t have a school-issued laptop. And parents have argued their students are better off with their phones, helping them coordinate afternoon pickup times or text their parents for advice about a school bully.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect students to say \u2014 or parents of high schoolers to say \u2014 right, that, they don\u2019t want their kids to have cellphones,\u201d said Howard Hepburn, Broward superintendent of schools. \u201cThe expectation that we\u2019re going to just have a hard stop is not reality. It takes time.\u201d",
      "Landyn Spellberg, a student advisor to the Broward school board, said there are a lot of benefits to phones \u2014 and that the district's blanket ban isn't helping students with something many adults still struggle with: learning how to use technology in a healthy way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we teach students about the negatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t inform students of those things.\u201d",

      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "TOKYO -- Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a \u201cconveyor belt road\u201d by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers.",
      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",
      "The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet.",
      "The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future.",
      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",
      "\u201cThat means the 2024 problem isn\u2019t just a transportation problem but really a people\u2019s problem,\u201d Yano said.",

      "Two sister meteor showers are already flashing across night skies \u2014 and will peak a week apart",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two sister meteor showers are already flashing across night skies \u2014 and will peak a week apart.",
      "The Southern Taurids will reach their zenith early Tuesday morning and the Northern Taurids on Nov. 12.",
      "While the two showers only produce around five visible meteors per hour under ideal viewing conditions, they are often very bright fireballs, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s notable is that they\u2019re likely to produce brighter and longer-lasting meteors than some other showers, even if there aren\u2019t as many\u201d at a time, she said.",
      "The Southern Taurids will peak on an evening with only a slim crescent moon just 11% full. The Northern Taurids may be more obstructed by moonlight since the moon will be 79% full.",
      "Viewing of both showers will last into December. Here\u2019s what to know about the Taurids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. Both showers share the same parent source \u2014 originating from the debris of comet Encke.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",
      "The two showers share similar names because, when seen in the night sky, they appear to originate from different points in the constellation Taurus.",
      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",
      "And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "Not long after the Taurids, the next big meteor shower, the Leonids, will peak on the early morning of Nov. 17.",

      "A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it survived a massive earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant has been shut down again due to an equipment problem",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 09:02:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The English village of Abbots Langley has become a flashpoint in a British battle over data centers",
    "story": [
      "The English village of Abbots Langley has become a flashpoint in a British battle over data centers",
      "ABBOTS LANGLEY, England -- Originally built to store crops from peasant farmers, the Tithe Barn on the edge of the English village of Abbots Langley was converted into homes that preserve its centuries of history. Now, its residents are fighting to stop a development next door that represents the future.",
      "A proposal to build a data center on a field across the road was rejected by local authorities amid fierce opposition from villagers. But it's getting a second chance from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is pursuing reforms to boost economic growth following his Labour party's election victory in July.",
      "Residents of Abbots Langley, 18 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of London, worry the facility will strain local resources and create noise and traffic that damages the character of the quiet village, which is home to just over 20,000 people. Off the main street there's a church with a stone tower built in the 12th century and, further down the road, a picturesque circular courtyard of rustic thatched-roof cottages that used to be a farm modeled on one built for French Queen Marie Antoinette.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just hideously inappropriate,\u201d said Stewart Lewis, 70, who lives in one of the converted houses in the 600-year-old Tithe Barn. \u201cI think any reasonable person anywhere would say, \u2018Hang on, they want a data center? This isn\u2019t the place for it.'\u201d",
      "As the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for cloud-based computing from server farms around the world, such projects are pitting business considerations, national priorities and local interests against each other.",
      "Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has stepped in to review the appeals filed by developers of three data center projects after they were rejected by local authorities, taking the decision out of the hands of town planners. Those proposals include Abbots Langley and two projects in Buckinghamshire, which sits west of London. The first decision is expected by January.",
      "The projects are controversial because the data centers would be built on \u201cgreenbelt\u201d land, which has been set aside to prevent urbanization. Rayner wants to tap the greenbelt for development, saying much of it is low quality. One proposed Buckinghamshire project, for example, involves redeveloping an industrial park next to a busy highway.",
      "\u201cWhilst it\u2019s officially greenbelt designated land, there isn\u2019t anything \u2018green\u2019 about the site today,\u201d said Stephen Beard, global head of data centers at Knight Frank, a property consultancy that\u2019s working on the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually an eyesore which is very prominent from the M25\u2033 highway, he said.",
      "Greystoke, the company behind the Abbots Langley center and a second Buckinghamshire project to be built on a former landfill, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In an online video for Abbots Langley, a company representative says, \u201cWe have carried out a comprehensive search for sites, and this one is the very best.\u201d It doesn't specify which companies would possibly use the center.",
      "The British government is making data centers a core element of its economic growth plans, deeming them \u201ccritical national infrastructure\u201d to give businesses confidence to invest in them. Starmer has announced deals for new centers, including a 10 billion pound ($13 billion) investment from private equity firm Blackstone to build what will be Europe's biggest AI data center in northeast England.",
      "The land for the Abbots Langley data center is currently used to graze horses. It's bordered on two other sides by a cluster of affordable housing and a highway.",
      "Greystoke's plans to construct two large buildings totaling 84,000 square meters (904,00 square feet) and standing up to 20 meters (66 feet) tall have alarmed Lewis and other villagers, who worry that it will dwarf everything else nearby.",
      "They also doubt Greystoke's promise that it will create up to 260 jobs.",
      "\u201cEverything will be automated, so they wouldn\u2019t need people,\" said tech consultant Jennifer Stirrup, 51, who lives in the area.",
      "Not everyone in the village is opposed.",
      "Retiree Bryan Power says he would welcome the data center, believing it would benefit the area in a similar way as another big project on the other side of the village, the Warner Bros.' Studio Tour featuring a Harry Potter exhibition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll bring some jobs, whatever. It\u2019ll be good. Yeah. No problem. Because if it doesn\u2019t come, it\u2019ll go somewhere else,\u201d said Power, 56.",
      "One of the biggest concerns about data centers is their environmental impact, especially the huge amounts of electricity they need. Greystoke says the facility will draw 96 megawatts of \u201cIT load.\" But James Felstead, director of a renewable energy company and Lewis\u2019 neighbor, said the area\u2019s power grid wouldn\u2019t be able to handle so much extra demand.",
      "It's a problem reflected across Europe, where data center power demand is expected to triple by the end of the decade, according to consulting firm McKinsey. While the AI-fueled data boom has prompted Google, Amazon and Microsoft to look to nuclear power as a source of clean energy, worries about their ecological footprint have already sparked tensions over data centers elsewhere.",
      "Google was forced to halt plans in September for a $200 million data center in Chile\u2019s capital, Santiago, after community complaints about its potential water and energy usage.",
      "In Ireland, where many Silicon Valley companies have European headquarters, the grid operator has temporarily halted new data centers around Dublin until 2028 over worries they\u2019re guzzling too much electricity.",
      "A massive data center project in northern Virginia narrowly won county approval last year, amid heavy opposition from residents concerned about its environmental impact. Other places like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Singapore have imposed various restrictions on data centers.",
      "Public knowledge about the industry is still low but \u201cpeople are realizing more that these data centers are quite problematic,\u201d said Sebastian Lehuede, a lecturer in ethics, AI and society at King\u2019s College London who studied the Google case in Chile.",
      "As awareness grows about their environmental impact, Lehuede said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have more opposition from different communities.\""

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:38:31 -0500",
    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",

      "Trump's win was a vindication of his actions, Zachary Alam claimed.",
      "Moments before a convicted Jan. 6 rioter was sentenced to eight years in prison on Thursday, he sought a full pardon by claiming that Donald Trump's victory on Election Day vindicated his actions.",
      "Zachary Alam told the court that he wanted a new classification of pardon, which he called a \"full pardon of patriotism,\" for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021. That would come with monetary compensation, expungement of the charges from his criminal record and the assurance that he would never again be charged for his crimes.",
      "Alam seemed to characterize anything less as a \"second-class pardon\" and implied that he would not accept it.",
      "Although Alam did not deny his actions during the riot on the Capitol, stating, \"I will 100% admit my actions were not lawful on January 6,\" he also justified them by saying he was doing the right thing to protect democracy.",
      "\u201cTrue patriots do the right thing in spite of everything else,\u201c he claimed, adding that his fellow rioters had \u201cfought, cried, bled and died for what is right.\u201d",
      "\"Trump wasn't lying,\" Alam said in court, emphasizing that the American people voted for him \"four years later.\"",
      "Judge Dabney Friedrich described Alam's actions as a \"full-throated\" attack on the Constitution and \"not the acts of a patriot.\"",
      "She called Alam one of the \"most violent and aggressive\" rioters that day, noting that Capitol Police officers also described him as the loudest among them.",
      "At his trial, law enforcement officials recalled him repeatedly telling them, \"I'm going to f--- you up.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Justice Department, meanwhile, noted that Alam stood out on Jan. 6 \"because of his actions.\"",
      "Those included knocking out the glass door of the Speaker's Lobby and pushing up against three Capitol Police officers who were trying to keep the mob from entering the floor of the House of Representatives.",
      "He scaled four floors of the Capitol, kicked doors and threw a velvet rope over a balcony in an attempt to hit officers below.",
      "In the courtroom, the Justice Department asserted, \u201cThere are consequences to taking law into your own hands.\u201d",
      "Leaving the Capitol after Ashli Babbitt was shot, Alam shouted to fellow rioters that they \"need guns.\"",
      "He then fled and tried to conceal his identity.",
      "He was arrested about a month later.",
      "Alam also claimed in court that the Justice Department coerced defendants into taking plea deals -- an argument the judge dismissed on Thursday.",
      "He asked if the insurgence on Jan. 6 had truly threatened democracy, observing in court that the American people had reelected Trump just 48 hours prior.",
      "\"Sometimes you have to break the rules to do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "Alam's attorney Steven Metcalf argued that his client should serve five years in prison, including the nearly four years he had already served, along with time in a halfway house.",
      "Metcalf noted that his client had no friends and had been in and out of solitary confinement, both for his behavior and concerns about his safety.",
      "The attorney said in court that some people are not going to change their beliefs, but conceded that Alam \"can't choose to take things in his own hands.\"",
      "He emphasized the need for rehabilitation to help people like his client.",
      "Alam's attorney depicted him as a defendant who lacked a support system. At the time of the Jan. 6 riot, he was living inside a storage unit and was not close with his family, according to Metcalf. His parents never appeared in court.",
      "He asserted that Capitol Police officers were not traumatized by Alam specifically, arguing that they were not physically hurt by him or his direct actions.",
      "The judge challenged Metcalf's argument, emphasizing that the Capitol Police officers stationed in the Speaker's Lobby were the \"last stand\" between rioters and lawmakers.",
      "She said Alam's actions contributed to the trauma that those officers faced on Jan 6.",
      "Alam said that he was willing to undergo rehabilitation, but the judge -- citing his lack of remorse -- instead sentenced him to over eight years in prison and three years of supervised release.",

    "story": [
      "Trump also led among \"double hater\" voters, poll finds.",
      "Claiming superior leadership and casting himself as the true agent of change were keys to Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election, per ABC News exit poll results.",
      "He also prevailed by a wide margin among the small group of so-called \"double haters\" -- voters with an unfavorable opinion of both candidates.",
      "In a list of four candidate qualities, 30% of voters nationally rated \"has the ability to lead\" as most important to their vote, and about as many, 28%, chose \"can bring needed change.\" Fewer picked \"has good judgment\" (20%) or \"cares about people like me\" (18%).",
      "These choices were closely tied to candidate preferences. Among those who cited leadership ability as the top candidate attribute, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 2-1, 66-33%. On bringing about change, the gap widened to 3-1, 74-24%.",
      "That huge gap on change reflects Harris' difficulties distancing herself from the unpopular Biden administration, a dynamic covered in ABC News/Ipsos pre-election polling. Seventy-four percent of Americans said they wanted Harris, if elected, to take a new direction from President Joe Biden's. Only 33% thought she would.",
      "Harris pushed back with big leads among voters who picked judgment or empathy as most important -- but there were fewer of them.",
      "Taken another way, among Trump supporters, 41% chose \"can bring needed change\" as the most important candidate attribute in their vote and 40% chose leadership, totaling to eight in 10 of all his voters.",
      "By contrast, about six in 10 Harris supporters chose judgment or caring as top qualities to them. Compared with Trump, half as many cited leadership and a third as many picked the ability to bring change.",
      "Personal favorability was another factor.",
      "In 2020, Biden was seen favorably by 52%, 6 percentage points above Trump's 46%. This year, Harris ended up rated essentially as unfavorably as Trump -- 47-52%, favorable-unfavorable, for Harris, and 46-53% for Trump. (This is a change from preliminary exit poll results, in which Trump was 11 points underwater in favorability, Harris just 2 points.)",
      "Notably, Trump won the 8% of voters who rated both candidates unfavorably, by 26 points, 56-30%.",
      "Look also at assessments of how extreme the candidates' views were: 47% said Harris' views were too extreme; 54% said that of Trump. But among those who said both were too extreme, again 8% of voters, Trump won by a broad 42 points, 63-21%.",

    "story": [
      "Vance will leave a vacancy when he departs for the Trump administration.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance has served in the United States Senate for less than two years, but after President-elect Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's election, Vance is about to get a promotion to president of the Senate -- and leave his post as one of Ohio's senators.",
      "When Vance becomes vice president in January, he'll leave a vacancy in the Senate that will need to be filled by a new Ohio senator. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022, and his term in the Senate does not expire until 2028.",
      "If Vance follows the example set by past active senators who became vice president-elects, he'll likely retain his position as Ohio's junior senator until January, only resigning his seat as the inauguration approaches.",
      "Different states have different rules for how Senate vacancies are filled. In Ohio, the governor of the state has the power to appoint someone to temporarily fill the vacancy. A special election will then be held in November 2026 to fill the vacancy through the remainder of Vance's existing term in 2028.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who won't face reelection until 2026, will get to select who fills Vance's seat after he resigns. DeWine is a Republican, so the seat would probably remain safely in Republican hands -- at least until the next state election.",
      "But DeWine and Vance are ideologically quite far apart, which means a Republican DeWine appoints to the Senate could bring quite a different energy to the chamber than Vance does. DeWine is a more moderate, establishment Republican while Vance often criticizes that faction of the party.",
      "Speculation is ongoing about who DeWine could possibly select to replace Vance when the time comes. ABC News reached out to DeWine's team for comment, but didn't hear back by the time of publication.",
      "DeWine issued a statement congratulating Vance when Trump selected him as his running mate over the summer.",
      "\"President Trump has made a great choice and Senator Vance will be a great partner as they campaign together this fall,\" DeWine said.",
      "Vance's replacement won't be the only new senator from Ohio to join the incoming Congress in the new year.",
      "In one of the most closely watched Senate races of this election cycle, three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his race against Republican Bernie Moreno.",
      "Moreno's victory helped to deliver a Senate majority for Republicans.",
      "Depending on the timing of Vance's resignation, Moreno could be in the unique position of becoming Ohio's senior senator within moments of assuming the job.",
      "Vance, along with Trump, backed Moreno in a crowded Ohio Republican primary earlier this year.",
      "Moreno, following the news of Vance's selection as Trump's running made, issued a glowing statement on X calling him a \"brilliant selection\" and \"visionary leader.\"",
      "Though Moreno won in the primary match-up, DeWine had endorsed a different, more moderate choice: Matt Dolan.",
      "DeWine's primary endorsement could be a sign of the sort of person he'd be interested in selecting to fill the Vance vacancy.",

      "They \"busted their necks and took risks,\" Biden said in his remarks. \"Thank them for staffing voting sites, counting the votes, protecting the very integrity of the election. Many of them are volunteers who do it simply out of love for their country.\"",
      "One measure of their success: the absence of lawsuits contesting vote procedures or election results processing and certification. After the most litigated pre-election period in history, neither party has any major pending post-election litigation in state or federal courts."

      "In some cases, it may be more accurate to say that Republican candidates underperformed Trump, more than Democrats overperformed Harris. For example, in Pennsylvania, Harris is netting around 36,000 more votes than Casey, while Trump has over 140,000 more votes than McCormick \u2014 that means Trump voters weren't necessarily splitting their tickets to support Casey, but sitting out the downballot races completely. Much will surely be said in coming days and weeks about this ticket-splitting and what it may mean for both parties' strategies going forward.",
      "More updates on the outstanding vote in Pennsylvania",
      "As Nathaniel noted earlier, Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race is coming down to the wire with some uncertainty over how many outstanding votes are still remaining. The Pennsylvania Department of State has clarified that there are at least 100,000 total ballots left to be counted.",
      "McCormick's lead currently stands at around 33,000 votes, suggesting that \u2014 based on that outstanding vote estimate \u2014 Casey has a narrow path if he wins a little over two-thirds of the outstanding votes. And notably, this race could be headed for an automatic recount, which would be triggered under state rules if the margin of victory is 0.5% or less. McCormick is sitting just under that threshold right now.",
      "A Democratic hold in Virginia's 7th District",
      "ABC News projects that Democrat Eugene Vindman, an Army veteran and Trump whistleblower, will win the open-seat race in Virginia's 7th District, defeating Derrick Anderson. Readers may remember that Anderson, a former Army Green Beret, made news when campaign photos of him posing with his friend's wife and children emerged. The campaign didn't use the images, but there was speculation that because Anderson is single (he is now engaged), these photos were orchestrated to soften his image.",
      "Vindman's win means Democrats will retain this blue-leaning seat currently held by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who chose not to run in favor of running for governor in 2025.",
      "The AP has called Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race, but we're not there yet",
      "The AP has called the Pennsylvania Senate race for Republican Dave McCormick. However, ABC News is not yet reporting a projection in the race.",
      "As Geoffrey wrote yesterday, this seems to boil down to a question about how many ballots remain to be counted in Pennsylvania. Edison Research \u2014 from which ABC gets its election results \u2014 estimates that there are about 123,000 votes left to count in Philadelphia alone. But according to the Pennsylvania Department of State, only 99 precincts are not reporting statewide, and only 36,000 mail ballots are still uncounted (including 9,000 in Philadelphia).",
      "McCormick currently leads Democratic Sen. Bob Casey 48.9% to 48.5%, or a margin of almost 32,000 votes.",

    "title": "Democrats sift through 'unmitigated disaster' after Trump victory: ANALYSIS",
    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 23:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats hoped that voters wanted to move on from Donald Trump. Instead, they wanted more of him.",
    "story": [
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track,\" one Democrat said.",
      "In the end, most voters did want to go back.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats pounded away at a message of turning the page on former President Donald Trump and his brand of politics, promoting former aides who questioned his commitment to democracy and producing their own plans to combat things like price gouging and high home costs.",
      "Wednesday morning, though, they were reckoning with a stunning sweep by Trump, who as the now-president-elect, appeared set for a swing-state sweep and left Democrats wondering how it all went so wrong.",
      "\"Complete, unmitigated disaster,\" Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said when asked about the results. \"That was a wholesale repudiation of the Democratic message, the Democratic strategy, Harris' candidacy. There is no way to sugarcoat what an abject disaster this was.\"",
      "Trump's victory was thorough. He was projected to win or on pace to take all seven swing states up for grabs, while cutting down his margins in blue states from Minnesota to Virginia to New York. He lost women by 10 points after losing them by 15 in 2020, even after fury erupted over the scrapping of constitutional abortion protections. And he cut Harris' margin among Latino voters to 8 points after losing them by 33 points four years ago.",
      "Democrats, still licking their wounds as they spoke to ABC News Wednesday, had a laundry list of prescriptions for the party's woes, both strategically in how the 2024 race was waged and more fundamentally in how the party is perceived coast to coast and the state of its coalition.",
      "Harris took over in a particularly hectic series of events, taking over as Democrats' nominee from Joe Biden after the president's ruinous June debate poured jet fuel on concerns over his age and fitness for office.",
      "Many expressed dismay and frustration, distressed that Harris' historic candidacy and the party brand overall held insufficient appeal to win over voters who instead backed a twice-impeached former president convicted of 34 felonies whose closing message was so unfocused that it included riffing on a famous golfer's genitalia.",
      "Logistically, most pointed out the compressed timeline. In a country where elections have begun to run nearly two years long, Harris had about 100 days, leading some to point the finger at Biden for staying in the race as long as he did over the summer -- or even running for reelection at all.",
      "\"He never should've\" run for reelection, said Jim Kessler, the founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. \"Democrats and the Biden White House did not do a good enough job listening to the people, and they were saying loud and clear, 'your age is a concern.' And they chose to ignore that. They were also saying, the border's a concern, and so is crime. And they got to the right place on all of those things, including Biden's age. But it took them too long.\"",
      "Harris and Biden for weeks before the election touted policies they said would help Americans deal with rising costs and hammered Trump for essentially killing a bipartisan bill that would've strengthened border enforcement.",
      "But for months before that, the White House had insisted that the economy was strong, noting low unemployment numbers and the stock market while batting down worries over things like grocery costs, and was frustrated over the inability to stem the rise in unauthorized border crossings before leaning on executive orders that echoed those Trump himself had enacted.",
      "Trump and his allies went to work to paint Harris as out of touch on even more issues, blanketing the airwaves with ads highlighting Harris' policies from her 2019 run, including one underscoring her support for surgeries for transgender inmates, with a narrator saying that she was \"for they/them\" while Trump is \"for you.\"",
      "All the while, Harris, a loyal No. 2, appeared uncomfortable distancing herself from her boss.",
      "Later in the race, she insisted that her administration would not be a \"continuation\" of Biden's and that she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, which Biden hadn't done. But a viral clip on ABC's \"The View\" in which she said she couldn't think of anything substantively she'd do differently helped cement the existing link she had to a president whose approval rating was historically low enough to sink his party in a presidential race.",
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track, and she became the status quo candidate,\" said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville. \"And the history of status quo candidates\u2026is not good.\"",
      "Some Democrats boiled it down to a phrase that Carville himself made famous: it's the economy, stupid.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in September 2020 -- the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic -- found that Americans said they were better off than they were four years ago by a 22-point margin. The same poll conducted last September fond that Americans believed they were worse off than they were four years ago by a 13-point margin -- a 35-point swing.",
      "\"It's the inflation, stupid, right?\" said one source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking. \"At the end of the day, the biggest driver of people's voting behavior is their economic self-interest, and they felt, by a wide margin, that they were doing pretty well under Donald Trump and that they were not doing well under the current administration. Not to say that other stuff wasn't important, but it was all superseded by their own economic conditions.\"",
      "Beyond her association with Biden, Harris also leaned into one of his favorite arguments against Trump -- that he posed a threat to democracy.",
      "She had shunted the theme early in her campaign, instead working to introduce herself in an atmosphere of \"joy.\" But as old administration aides like John Kelly rebuked him as undemocratic, she pounced on a message that Democrats ultimately said felt unconnected to voters' everyday struggles.",
      "\"Democrats often make the mistake of focusing on long term problems at a time when voters have immediate concerns. And democracy seems like a long-term issue, and it's not quite tangible. But gas prices, grocery prices, border crossings, a sense that crime is rising, those you feel every day,\" Kessler said.",
      "Some Democrats saw deeper troubles.",
      "Gone were the days when Democrats appealed to working and middle-class Americans they said. In their place were rallies with Beyonce and concerts with Bruce Springsteen, while Democrats, in critics' telling, lectured voters on why the party was right on the issues instead of empathizing with their underlying concerns.",
      "In short, philosophizing rather than fighting.",
      "\"It was the economy, was inflation, it was concerned about the border, and those were, for the most part, the top two issues,\" Kofinis said. \"We had no strategy in order to address that. And as a result, we just fed that alienation. Then in classic Democratic presidential campaign strategy that was eerily reminiscent to 2016, we embrace celebrities and the elites to somehow influence and dictate to the average voter how they should vote.\"",
      "\"I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to fight NAFTA trade deals. I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I joined the Democratic Party because I was tired of seeing my tax dollars go to foreign wars while my community was crumbling. That sounds like Donald Trump today. We have to take that message back,\" added Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha.",
      "For Republicans, everything went right this election.",
      "Rather than deepen opposition, Trump's controversies and legal struggles deepened loyalties among his base. Rather than gin Democratic turnout, abortion ballot measures appeared to offer voters an off-ramp to fight for reproductive autonomy while separately registering their discontent with the current administration. And instead of running against a candidate who offered a fresh vision from the current White House, Trump faced the second-highest ranking official in it.",
      "Now, the struggle will be continuing the success.",
      "Trump's romp has the wind at Republicans' backs, and, should the GOP take the House of Representatives, he'll have at least two years to cement a string of accomplishments with a pliant Congress. But term limits bar Trump from running again, and replicating his coalition is easier said than done.",
      "\"That's what's going to be very, very difficult,\" said GOP pollster Robert Blizzard, who worked on the 2024 presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- one of several Republicans who ran for the White House adopting Trump's pugilistic style only to be overwhelmingly rejected by primary voters this year.",
      "Yet in recognition of the gravitation pull that Trump has on the country's politics, even some Democrats said their path back to electoral success lies in part on the president-elect.",
      "Voters \"are hoping to get a repeat of the economy that they liked in his first term. If they get that, the path back for Democrats in 2028 is going to be quite difficult. But if his tariffs drive up inflation and his recklessness really demonstrates to voters that he does not have the special sauce on the economy that many think that he does, that will create a real opening,\" said the source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.",
      "\"It's tough, but it's just the reality of Trump in many ways.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:40:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump has proposed featuring prayer in public schools and dismantling the Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "Trump has previously proposed dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "Former President Donald Trump -- now projected to be the next president of the United States -- has proposed sweeping reform for the nation's educational systems.",
      "Here's a look at what areas of education his second term might impact:",
      "Department of Education",
      "Trump's Agenda47 campaign proposed eliminating the Department of Education -- which, according to the DOE website, \"establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education.\"",
      "The DOE, established by President Jimmy Carter, provides programs such as Title I funding for low-achieving or high-poverty K-12 schools in need of support, as well as Pell Grants for undergraduate students in high financial need.",
      "Throughout Trump's first presidency, he proposed billions in cuts to the Department of Education's budget.",
      "In a campaign video, Trump said he wants states -- not the federal government -- to have control over schools.",
      "However, he has also outlined plans to further restrict content or classroom discussion in schools based on guidelines that would be executed at the federal level.",
      "Content restrictions",
      "Trump's campaign has outlined a plan that features prayer in public schools, an expansion of parental rights in education, patriotism as a centerpiece of education and an emphasis on the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "He has also called for the dismantling of diversity initiatives in education and federal funding cuts for schools or programs that feature \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.\" Republican-backed legislation across the country has similarly sought to limit these topics, and the efforts have been criticized for being vague and leading to \"censorship\" in schools and classrooms on topics concerning race, gender and politics.",
      "Similar policies and rhetoric against school content concerning race, gender, sex and more have coincided with the removal of more than 10,000 books from library shelves over the 2023-2024 school year, according to the free-expression advocacy group PEN America.",
      "Trump has also suggested that he would create a new credentialing body to certify teachers \"who embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life\" and reinstate his administration's 1776 Commission to align the teaching of history with the \"values\" of the founding of the United States -- though Agenda47 does not elaborate further on what such values are or define the criteria for embracing the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "School choice",
      "Trump also backs nationwide universal school choice programs, which allow a student's allotment of public education funds to be transferred to nonpublic schooling options -- including private schools or homeschooling.",
      "This comes as voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- have rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of school choice.",
      "Teacher pay and tenure",
      "Trump's Agenda47 also anticipates an end to teacher tenure laws. These laws are described by the United Federation of Teachers as state laws that prevent a school district from dismissing a tenured teacher without due process. Most states have tenure laws in place; however, at least 10 states have zero or limited tenure laws, according to the National Education Association.",
      "He also said he will adopt a merit pay for teachers. Some studies have shown that merit pay programs improve student outcomes, but critics argue there is not enough evidence and that various factors impact student performance -- including funding and resource inequity.",
      "Higher education",
      "Trump's agenda for higher education includes creating a new, free university called the \"American Academy\" and fund it by \"taxing, fining and suing\" private universities.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 16:59:53 -0500",
    "summary": "ABC News follows gun violence survivor Drew Spiegel and Rep. Maxwell Frost as they push for stricter gun laws.",
    "story": [
      "Survivor Drew Spiegel and Rep. Maxwell Frost are taking the long view.",
      "Drew Spiegel was preparing to march in the 2022 Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park when gunfire rang out.",
      "\"In that short time span, seven people died, 48 more [were] injured,\" the 19-year-old told ABC News. \"I texted my parents that I might not be coming home from the Fourth of July parade. And my life forever changed.\"",
      "For more than a year after the shooting, Spiegel didn't talk about it. That changed when he got to college and encountered the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "\"They asked me straight up like, 'Are you a survivor of gun violence?' \" he said. \"And I was like, no, but technically I was at a mass shooting. And they were like, so then yes.\"",
      "The U.S. sees 43,000 fatal shootings every year, and 120 people are fatally shot every day, according to Angela Ferrell-Zabala, the executive director of Moms Demand Action, an Everytown subsidiary group.",
      "\"This is bigger than a mass shooting problem, it's a gun violence epidemic,\" Spiegel said, citing the July assassination attempt and apparent September attempt on former President Donald Trump, who won a second term in the White House on Tuesday, as evidence of the problem's scale.",
      "\"If Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, is not safe from gun violence, then nobody is,\" he said.",
      "Now, Spiegel is sharing his story with people who may have different opinions than him.",
      "\"The change we're fighting for, is not mutually exclusive with the Second Amendment. They can coexist,\" he told ABC News. \"We can have a country where people are allowed to have guns and also a country where you don't have to worry about going to school.\"",
      "But he isn't just thinking in terms of the next four years -- he's looking at how the laws made in the coming decades could save lives.",
      "He's found an ally in Rep. Maxwell Frost, who won election in Florida's 10th Congressional District in 2022 and won reelection on Tuesday. The 27-year-old Democrat is also a survivor of gun violence and was previously the national organizing director for gun control advocacy group March For Our Lives.",
      "That movement didn't result in gun control legislation getting passed, but Frost accepts that change takes time.",
      "\"The way you measure the success of a movement is, you see the seeds are planted in people,\" Frost told ABC News. \"I'm the first person from that movement to be in Congress. That's a win, right? And then we got the Office of Gun Violence Prevention [in 2023]. That's a win.\"",
      "However, Frost warned ABC News in August that he foresees this progress being rolled back.",
      "\"If Donald Trump wins this election, one of the things he's going to do on Day One is get rid of the office completely. Get rid of it,\" he said. \"This office is helping to save lives across the entire country. So getting rid of the office literally means more people will die due to gun violence.\"",
      "With Trump returning to the White House in January, it's unclear how much progress gun control will make. In 2018, the Trump administration banned bump stocks, which allow guns to essentially operate as automatic weapons. However, the Supreme Court struck down that ban in June.",
      "\"When I'm back in the Oval Office, no one will lay a finger on your firearms,\" he told National Rifle Association (NRA) members in February.",
      "Despite this, Spiegel is hoping people will keep fighting for gun violence prevention laws, to prevent stories similar to his own from happening all over again.",
      "\"I think our rights and freedoms will be under a higher attack than ever before. But I don't think it's completely over,\" he told ABC News. \"I think there's still a country and, more importantly, our friends and family in the country that are worth fighting for. And we just put our heads down and get back to work. You just keep fighting.\"",

    "summary": "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "A judge is blocking a Georgia county from approving larger homes in a tiny community of Black slave descendants as they ask the state's highest court to reinstate a canceled referendum on the rezoning of their island enclave",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A judge has blocked a Georgia county from approving larger homes in a tiny island community of Black slave descendants until the state's highest court decides whether residents can challenge by referendum zoning changes they fear will lead to unaffordable tax increases.",
      "Hogg Hummock on Sapelo Island was founded after the Civil War by slaves who worked the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding. It's one of the South's few remaining communities of people known as Gullah-Geechee, whose isolation from the mainland resulted in a unique culture with deep ties to Africa.",
      "The few dozen Black residents remaining on the Georgia island have spent the past year fighting local officials in McIntosh County over a new zoning ordinance. Commissioners voted in September 2023 to double the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock, weakening development restrictions enacted nearly three decades earlier to protect the shrinking community of modest houses along dirt roads.",
      "Residents and their advocates sought to repeal the zoning changes under a rarely used provision of Georgia's constitution that empowers citizens to call special elections to challenge local laws. They spent months collecting more than 1,800 petition signatures and a referendum was scheduled for Oct. 1.",
      "McIntosh County commissioners filed suit to stop the vote. Senior Judge Gary McCorvey halted the referendum days before the scheduled election and after hundreds of ballots were cast early. He sided with commissioners' argument that zoning ordinances are exempt from being overturned by voters.",
      "Hogg Hummock residents are appealing the judge's ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court, hoping to revive and reschedule the referendum.",
      "On Monday, McCorvey granted their request to stop county officials from approving new building permits and permit applications under the new zoning ordinance until the state Supreme Court decides the case.",
      "The new zoning law increased the maximum size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock to 3,000 square feet (278 square meters) of total enclosed space. The previous limit was 1,400 square feet (130 square meters) of heated and air-conditioned space.",
      "Residents say larger homes in their small community would lead to higher property taxes, increasing pressure to sell land held in their families for generations.",
      "McCorvey in his ruling Monday said Hogg Hummock residents have a \u201cchance of success\" appealing his decision to cancel the referendum, and that permitting larger homes in the island community before the case is decided could cause irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cA victory in the Supreme Court would be hollow indeed, tantamount to closing a barn door after all the horses had escaped,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "Attorneys for McIntosh County argued it is wrong to block an ordinance adopted more than a year ago. Under the judge's order, any new building permits will have to meet the prior, stricter size limits.",
      "Less than a month after the referendum on Hogg Hummock's zoning was scrapped, Sapelo Island found itself reeling from an unrelated tragedy.",
      "Hundreds of tourists were visiting the island on Oct. 19 when a walkway collapsed at the state-operated ferry dock, killing seven people. It happened as Hogg Hummock was celebrating its annual Cultural Day festival, a day intended to be a joyful respite from worries about the community's uncertain future.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court has not scheduled when it will hear the Sapelo Island case. The court last year upheld a citizen-called referendum from 2022 that stopped coastal Camden County from building a commercial spaceport.",
      "The spaceport vote relied on a provision of Georgia\u2019s constitution that allows organizers to force special elections to challenge \u201clocal acts or ordinances, resolutions, or regulations\u201d of local governments if they get a petition signed by 10% to 25%, depending on population, of a county\u2019s voters.",
      "In the Sapelo Island case, McCorvey ruled that voters can't call special elections to veto zoning ordinances because they fall under a different section of the state constitution."

      "A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died has been sentenced to two years in prison",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "Republican Jeff Hurd has won the U.S. House seat in Colorado that Rep. Lauren Boebert left",
      "Republican Jeff Hurd has won the U.S. House seat in Colorado that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert nearly lost in 2022 then left for another race, a risky but ultimately successful bet she took in the hopes of keeping the seat in GOP hands and staying in Congress herself.",
      "Hurd, more mild-mannered than Boebert and hewing to an older GOP tradition, beat Adam Frisch, the Democrat who nearly unseated Boebert two years ago in the 3rd Congressional District, which covers the state\u2019s Rocky Mountains. Boebert, meanwhile, won a seat in the 4th Congressional District.",
      "Hurd was leading by about 12,000 votes in unofficial results as of Thursday \u2014 a much larger margin than the 546 votes Boebert won by in 2022.",
      "Hurd campaigned on a platform centered around rural jobs and the cost of living, alongside more national issues such as border security. He was not endorsed by former and incoming President Donald Trump and rarely mentioned him during the campaign. That's in stark contrast to Boebert, who spoke and prayed often for Trump on the campaign trail, and swung an endorsement from him in the 4th District.",
      "\u201cI got into this race to ensure that our rural communities are not forgotten,\u201d Hurd said in a written statement. \u201cIt will be an honor and privilege to represent the district where I was raised.\u201d",
      "Hurd thanked Frisch and voters for participating in the elections process, saying, \u201cYour engagement is the lifeblood of our democracy. Let us move forward with confidence in our democratic institutions.\u201d",
      "Hurd overcame a massive fundraising deficit against Frisch, who had one of the largest U.S. House campaign chests in the nation. Frisch\u2019s contributions were fueled by donations from around the country from Democrats who disliked Boebert. Frisch is a businessman and former city councilmember in Aspen.",
      "Frisch, in a phone call, said Trump's sweeping victory this week presented a challenge for his own prospects in the historically Republican-leaning district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can swim against the tide,\u201d he said. As for whether Frisch would have won if Boebert hadn\u2019t left the race, he remarked, \u201cDo I think we would\u2019ve beaten Boebert? Yes. Can I guarantee that? No.\"",
      "Boebert is an ardent Trump loyalist and a rabble-rouser who\u2019s helped define an ultra-conservative flank of the House. She left the race to run in the 4th District, a Republican stronghold covering a sweep of the Great Plains, saying she didn\u2019t want to give Democrats a chance to \u201cbuy\u201d the seat in the 3rd.",
      "Boebert's move came after Frisch nearly beat her two years ago. She was later caught on tape vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even loyal supporters.",
      "Justifying her change of districts, Boebert said, \u201cThere is a need for my voice in Congress.\u201d",
      "She later said she wanted a fresh start for her family after a messy and public divorce.",
      "After successfully fighting through a packed Republican primary election, where she avoided a surprise political threat with some behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Boebert is now the incumbent in a safely red seat formerly held by conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck.",
      "When Buck resigned earlier this year, he cited the flank of the party that is known for its hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump \u2014 traits that made Boebert a name brand.",
      "Hurd's victory also bore out Boebert's hope that her move would allow Republicans to maintain control of the district that first elected her in 2020.",
      "Boebert has been criticized for her intractable politics \u2014 stonewalling the January 2023 vote to elect Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, for example \u2014 but has said that her actions are aimed at keeping the promises she made on the campaign trail."

      "Some of the Donald Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago are celebrating the president-elect's electoral victory",
      "WASHINGTON -- As it became clear Donald Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. \u201cY\u2019all are in trouble,\u201d he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media.",
      "Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump\u2019s victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he has called \u201chostages\u201d and \u201cpatriots,\u201d during his victory speech on Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump's praise of Jan. 6 defendants was a centerpiece of his campaign, with rallies honoring them as heroes featuring a song he collaborated on with a group of jailed rioters. Trump hasn't explained how he will decide who gets pardoned. But he has suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot in 2020 to keep Trump in power.",
      "During his first term as president, Trump deployed his pardon power in overtly political ways, granting clemency in his final days in office to a broad range of political allies -- including five defendants convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation -- as well as celebrities, Republican members of Congress and the father of Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.",
      "Jacob Lang, a Capitol riot defendant who's jailed while awaiting a trial in Washington, posted within hours of Trump's victory that he and other Jan. 6 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d were \u201cfinally coming home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will be no bitterness in my heart as I walk out of these doors in 75 days on inauguration day,\u201d Lang wrote.",
      "Lawyers for some Jan. 6 defendants cited Trump's victory in requests to hold off on sentencing their clients.",
      "Defense attorney Marina Medvin said her client, Christopher Carnell, is \u201cexpecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\u201d Michelle Peterson, an assistant federal public defender, argued it would be \"fundamentally unfair\" to sentence a client whose case may be dismissed by Trump's Justice Department.",
      "Judges swiftly denied both requests and refused to delay separate hearings for their respective cases on Friday.",
      "Other defense attorneys on Wednesday asked for a Jan. 6 defendant's trial to be postponed. They argued that their client, Mitchell Bosch, cannot receive a fair trial in Washington so soon after the election given that voters in the nation's capital overwhelmingly supported Harris over Trump.",
      "\u201cMr. Bosch understands that the President-elect\u2019s proclamations of stolen elections and pardons for patriots are not relevant evidence in his trial. However, they are highly relevant to the ability of the jury pool to be fair and impartial,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A trial is scheduled to start next week for Steve Baker, a writer charged with Capitol riot-related misdemeanors. Baker, who has written articles about the Jan. 6 riot for the conservative outlet Blaze News, posted a photo of a press credential for him to cover Congress.",
      "\"I plan on covering J6, 2025 \u2018inside\u2019 the Capitol,\" he wrote on Wednesday, adding a winking face emoji.",
      "Of the more than 1,000 convicted rioters who have been sentenced, over 650 have received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years. Hundreds of people who went into the Capitol but did not attack police or damage the building were charged only with misdemeanors. The violence and destruction by other members of the mob have been documented in videos and other evidence heard in court, including testimony from police officers about being beaten and scared for their lives as they defended the Capitol.",
      "Trump has said he would issue pardons to Capitol rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency. He told Time Magazine he would consider pardoning all of the Jan. 6 defendants, though later added: \u201cIf somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently.\u201d He told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last year that he would consider pardoning former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy. Trump said Tarrio was treated \u201chorribly.\u201d",
      "When pressed during an event in July, Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would pardon rioters accused of assaulting police \u2014 if they were \u201cinnocent.\u201d When the interviewer noted she was talking about convicted rioters, Trump replied that they were convicted \u201cby a very tough system.\u201d",
      "Kim Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor and author of a book about presidential pardons, said presidents have the unfettered power to issue mass pardons.",
      "\u201cThe pardon system is set up for winners and losers. Who gets them and who doesn\u2019t get them is completely subjective. It\u2019s completely arbitrary and based on the whims of the president,\u201d Wehle said. \u201cDonald Trump could fashion the pardon however he wants to fashion the pardon, and the general public wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge it.\u201d",
      "Presidents have used their power to issue mass pardons for the sake of promoting national unity. George Washington pardoned Whiskey Rebellion rebels. Abraham Lincoln pardoned former Confederate soldiers after the Civil War. Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam War draft dodgers.",
      "Many of those expressing support for Jan. 6 defendants also echoed Trump's campaign talk of seeking retribution against political foes. Julie Kelly, a right-wing political commentator who calls herself a \u201cJ6 conspiracy theorist\u201d on her social media profile, posted that Washington-based U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves' \u201creign of terror is going to end soon.\"",

      "Lawyers for a man charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students have asked a judge to take the death penalty off the table",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Attorneys for a man charged in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students asked a judge to take the death penalty off the table Thursday, arguing that international, federal and state law all make it inappropriate for the case.",
      "Bryan Kohberger is accused of the Nov. 13, 2022, killings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. Investigators said they were able to link Kohberger \u2014 then a graduate student at nearby Washington State University \u2014 to the crime from DNA found on a knife sheath at the scene, surveillance videos and cellphone data.",
      "When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "During a pre-trial motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team made a broad range of arguments against the death penalty, saying in part that it does not fit today's standards of decency, that it is cruel to make condemned inmates sit for decades on death row awaiting execution and that it violates an international treaty prohibiting the torture of prisoners.",
      "But 4th District Judge Stephen Hippler questioned many of those claims, saying that the international treaty they referenced was focused on ensuring that prisoners are given due process so they are not convicted and executed without a fair trial.",
      "Prosecutors noted that the Idaho Supreme Court has already considered many of those arguments in other capital cases and allowed the the death penalty to stand.",
      "Still, by bringing up the issues during the motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team took the first step toward preserving their legal arguments in the court record, potentially allowing them to raise them again on appeal.",
      "The judge said he would issue a written ruling on the motions later.",
      "Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, attended the hearing. Afterward they said the details of the case show the death penalty is merited.",
      "\u201cYou've got four victims, all in one house \u2014 that's more than enough,\u201d Steve Goncalves said.",
      "Kristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIf he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,\u201d she said.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys have said he was out for a drive the night of the killings, something he often did to look at the sky.",
      "His trial is scheduled to begin next August and is expected to last up to three months. The Goncalves family said they have rented a home in Boise so they can attend."

      "The charges against Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and council member Aaron B. Banks were brought after two people working for the FBI posed as real estate developers who wanted to build a hotel near the convention center in downtown Jackson and provided payments to officials, including $50,000 for the mayor\u2019s reelection campaign, according to court documents.",
      "Lumumba, Jody Owens and Banks each pleaded not guilty Thursday during an appearance before a magistrate judge, with supporters of the mayor filling the small courtroom. The three men will remain free while awaiting trial.",
      "Outside the courthouse, Lumumba said he is grateful to people who have reached out to him locally, nationally and internationally.",
      "\u201cI am not guilty, and so I will not proceed as a guilty man,\u201d Lumumba said. \u201cI will continue to handle the business of the city of Jackson while my attorneys continue to handle the business of these court proceedings.\u201d",
      "The mayor released a video statement Wednesday saying the indictment is a \u201cpolitical prosecution\u201d to hurt his 2025 campaign for reelection. He also said: \u201cI have never accepted a bribe of any type.\u201d",
      "Owens told reporters outside the courthouse Thursday that the indictment is \u201ca horrible example of a flawed FBI investigation\u201d and \u201can assassination attempt on my character.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think the truth has to come out, that cherry-picked statements of drunken, locker-room banter is not a crime,\u201d Owens said.

      "In May, FBI agents raided Owens' office and a cigar bar he owns in downtown Jackson. Among the items found in the district attorney's office was a lockbox made to look like a book labeled as the U.S. Constitution, containing about $20,000 in cash, with about $9,900 showing serial numbers confirming it was paid by the purported developers to Owens, according to the newly unsealed indictment.",
      "Owens boasted to the purported developers about having influence over Jackson officials and \u201cfacilitated over $80,000 in bribe payments\u201d to Lumumba, Banks and Lee in exchange for their agreement to ensure approval of the multimillion-dollar downtown development, according to the indictment.",
      "The document also says Owens \u201csolicited and accepted at least $115,000 in cash and promises of future financial benefits\u201d from the purported developers to use his relationships with Lumumba, Banks and Lee and act as an intermediary for the payments to them.",
      "Lumumba directed a city employee to move a deadline to favor the purported developers\u2019 project, and Banks and Lee agreed to vote in favor of it, according to the indictments unsealed Thursday.",
      "Sherik Marve Smith \u2014 who is an insurance broker and a relative of Owens, according to court documents \u2014 waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a federal bribery charge in the case on Oct. 17. He agreed to forfeit $20,000, and his sentencing is set for Feb. 19.",
      "Smith conspired to give cash payments and campaign contributions to two Jackson elected officials, and the money came from the purported developers who were working for the FBI, according to court documents.",
      "Owens, Lumumba, Smith and the purported developers traveled in April on a private jet paid by the FBI to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to the newly unsealed indictment.",
      "During a meeting on a yacht that was recorded on audio and video, Lumumba received five campaign checks for $10,000 each, and he called a Jackson city employee and instructed that person to move a deadline for submission of proposals to develop the property near the convention center, the indictment says.",
      "The deadline was moved in a way to benefit the purported developers who were working for the FBI by likely eliminating any of their competition, the indictment says."

      "Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, is in a tight race to keep his seat in Congress against Austin Theriault, a stock car driver and Republican state lawmaker",
      "LEWISTON, Maine -- With control of the U.S. House of Representatives still in question, Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, led by a thin margin over Republican Austin Theriault on Thursday in a race that was still too early to call two days after voting ended.",
      "The matchup between Golden and Theriault is one of a handful of pivotal races with a chance to influence control of the U.S. House of Representatives during a competitive election year. It played out in the largest congressional district by area on the East Coast, a largely rural part of Maine where former President Donald Trump has proven very popular with voters.",
      "Thursday afternoon, Golden and Theriault were in a tight race with some of the vote yet to be counted. Theriault requested a recount Thursday, although the final tallies were not yet finished.",
      "Golden is a former Marine in his third term representing the 2nd Congressional District, which is typically described as a swing district. The district covers a vast part of Maine that includes a handful of small cities but is perhaps best known as the home of traditional northern New England industries such as lobster fishing and logging.",
      "During the campaign, Golden touted his ability to work with members of either political party along with his advocacy on behalf of the lobster industry, which is the lifeblood of the region\u2019s economy. He declared himself the winner of the race Wednesday, though it has not been called by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has observed this race knows that this was my toughest election yet. Across the country, no Democrat has withstood stronger headwinds from the top of the ticket, the pundits and the organized opposition,\u201d Golden said, wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans at a news conference in Lewiston.",
      "Theriault, who was first elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2022, spent much of the campaign portraying Golden as too liberal for the district. Although Theriault had the backing of Trump, he also attempted to portray himself as a potential uniter during a divided time in Washington.",
      "Theriault said Wednesday that he was \u201cwell within the margin\u201d where a recount was possible \u201cand every vote should be counted.\u201d Thursday, he made that request formal.",
      "Maine has no mandatory recounts even in close elections. But the state does allow candidates to request a recount. The state does not require a deposit for a recount if the margin of victory is 1% or less for statewide or multicounty races.",
      "\u201cWe must work together to ensure the Mainers\u2019 voices are heard and the final result reflects the will of the people,\u201d said Theriault campaign manager Shawn Roderick.",
      "Golden \u201chas trust and faith in the process of determining the victor, and is ready for a recount if one is necessary,\u201d said Mario Moretto, a spokesperson for the congressman.",
      "It was also possible neither candidate would crack 50% of the total vote, and that would necessitate a ranked choice count. There was no third-party candidate on the ballot, but write-in candidates were still possible, and some voters used that option.",
      "Golden was first elected to Congress in 2018, when he needed the ranked choice voting count to defeat Republican incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin.",
      "Golden has held onto his seat despite Trump dominating the district in recent presidential elections. Maine is one of two states to apportion electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 Nebraska is the other \u2014 and Trump has won his sole New England electoral vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd District three times.",
      "In the 1st Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree won her ninth term against Republican challenger Ron Russell and independent Ethan Alcorn."

      "San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie after a brutal campaign over homelessness and public safety",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor, London Breed, conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie on Thursday, pledging a smooth transition as he takes over the job.",
      "The Associated Press has not yet declared a winner because tens of thousand of ballots have not yet been counted and added to the ranked choice voting calculations.",
      "Breed, who was raised by her grandmother in public housing, could not overcome deep voter discontent and was trailing Lurie, a philanthropist and anti-poverty nonprofit founder.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this job is bigger than any one person and what matters is that we keep moving this City forward,\u201d Breed said, adding that she had called Lurie to congratulate him. \u201cI know we are both committed to improving this City we love.\u201d",
      "While San Francisco\u2019s streets have been cleaner and homeless tents much harder to find in recent months, Breed\u2019s fellow Democratic challengers on the campaign trail repeatedly hammered her administration for doing too little, too late as homeless tent encampments, open-air drug use and brazen retail theft proliferated during her six years in office.",
      "Political analyst Dan Schnur said there\u2019s been a demand nationwide for change in leadership.",
      "\u201cLondon Breed didn\u2019t create the crime and homelessness crises, but voters blamed her for not fixing them,\u201d he said.",
      "She faced four big-name challengers, including two San Francisco supervisors and a former interim mayor.",
      "But voters flocked to Lurie, 47, a city native from a storied family who pledged to bring accountability and public service back to City Hall. He is the founder of Tipping Point Community, which says it has invested more than $400 million since 2005 in programs to help people with housing, education and early childhood.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to my incredible family, campaign team and every San Franciscan who voted for accountability, service, and change,\u201d Lurie said in a statement. \u201cNo matter who you supported in this election, we stand united in the fight for San Francisco\u2019s future and a safer and more affordable city for all.\u201d",
      "Lurie pumped nearly $9 million of his own money into his first-time bid for mayor, which drew criticism from Breed and other opponents. But he said that as a political outsider, he needed to introduce himself to voters and in the end, some voters said they liked that Lurie\u2019s financial wealth shielded him from being beholden to special interests.",
      "Lurie is an heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune through his mother, Mimi Haas, who wed Peter Haas when Daniel was a child. Peter Haas, a great-grandnephew of Levi Strauss, was a longtime CEO of the iconic clothing company who died in 2005.",
      "Both the Levi\u2019s name and Haas family philanthropic foundations are deeply embedded in San Francisco\u2019s history and identity.",
      "Lurie\u2019s father, Brian Lurie, is a rabbi and longtime former executive director of the San Francisco-based Jewish Community Federation.",
      "Breed won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s term.",
      "She was reelected in 2019 to a full term that has lasted five years instead of the typical four, after voters changed the election calendar to line up with presidential contests."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback.",
      "\u201cGoodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\u201d Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he'd arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. \u201cWe will see you soon.\u201d",
      "Four years later, he's fulfilled his prophecy.",
      "With his commanding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump achieved a comeback that seemed unimaginable after the 2020 election ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol after he refused to accept his defeat.",
      "In the years that followed, Trump was widely blamed for Republican losses, indicted four times, convicted on 34 felony counts, ruled to have inflated his assets in a civil fraud trial and found liable for sexual abuse. He still faces fines that top more than half a billion dollars and the prospect of jail time.",
      "But Trump managed to turn his legal woes into fuel that channeled voters' anger. He seized on widespread discontent over the direction of a country battered by years of high inflation. And he spoke to a new generation \u2014 using podcasts and social media \u2014 to tell those who felt forgotten that he shared their disdain for the status quo.",
      "And he did so while surviving two attempted assassinations and a late-stage candidate replacement by Democrats.",
      "\u201cThis was a campaign of October surprises,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said hours after clinching victory. \u201cWhen you think about it, whether it was indictments, convictions, assassination attempts, the switching out of the candidate \u2014 I mean it was a campaign of firsts on so many different levels.\u201d",
      "Trump had entered the general election after sweeping the GOP primaries and routing a crowded field of candidates. The indictments against him dominated news coverage and forced even his rivals to rally around him as he cast himself as the victim of a politically motivated effort to hobble his candidacy.",
      "A late June debate against President Joe Biden \u2014 which the Biden campaign had pushed for \u2014 ended disastrously for the president, who struggled to put words together and repeatedly lost his train of thought.",
      "When Trump arrived at the Republican National Convention to formally accept his party's nomination for the second time weeks later, he seemed unstoppable. Just two days earlier, a gunman had opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, unleashing a hail of bullets that grazed his ear and left one supporter dead.",
      "After the gunman had been killed, Trump stood, surrounded by Secret Service agents, his face streaked by blood, and raised his fist in the air \u2014 shouting \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 as the crow erupted into cheers. The moment became a rallying cry for his campaign.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make somebody iconic, try to throw them in jail. Try to bankrupt them. ... If you want to make somebody iconic, try to kill him,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who has known Trump for 45 years and was pardoned by the former president. \u201dAll of those things failed. They just made him bigger and more powerful as a political force. Every one of those things turbocharged his candidacy.\"",
      "Trump had appeared to be on a glide path to victory. But just days later, Democrats, fearing a blowout loss and panicking over Biden's age and ability to do the job for another four years, successfully persuaded the president to step aside and end his bid, making way for Harris\u2019 history-shattering candidacy.",
      "Trump campaign aides insisted they were prepared. Videos for the convention had been cut with two different versions: One featuring Biden, the other Harris, and versions attacking both were played on the big screens in Milwaukee.",
      "But the change sent Trump into a tailspin. He had spent millions, he complained, beating Biden, and now had to \u201cstart all over\u201d again \u2014 this time facing a candidate who was not only nearly two decades younger, embodying the generational change voters had said they wanted, but also a woman who would have become the country's first female president.",
      "In one particularly hostile appearance, Trump questioned the racial identity of the first woman of color to serve as vice president and to lead a major-party ticket before the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said of the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, who had attended a historically Black college and served as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
      "On his Truth Social site, he amplified a post that suggested Harris had used sexual favors to advance her career.",
      "Trump's campaign aides quickly pivoted to taking Harris down. They belittled her as unserious, with ads focused on her laugh. They labeled her \u201cdangerously liberal,\" highlighting the progressive policies she had embraced when she first ran for president in 2020.",
      "They argued her \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d messaging was fundamentally at odds with the sour mood of the electorate, and responded gleefully to Harris telling voters \u201cWe are not going back\" when many voters seemed to want just that.",
      "Though Trump had left office with a dismal approval rating, that number had ticked up considerably in the years that followed, amid concerns over high prices and the influx of migrants who entered the country illegally after Biden relaxed restrictions.",
      "Harris\u2019 momentum was just a sugar high, they said. Tony Fabrizio, the campaign pollster, called it \u201ca kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality.\u201d Soon, they predicted, what they dubbed the \u201cHarris honeymoon\u201d would subside.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign insisted they did not fundamentally change their strategy with Harris as their rival. Instead, they tried to cast her as the incumbent, tying her to every one of the Biden administration's most unpopular policies. Trump, the 78-year-old former president, would be the candidate of change \u2014 and one who had been tested.",
      "Harris played right into their hands. Asked during an October appearance on \u201cThe View\" if there was anything she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, she responded that there was \u201cnot a thing that comes to mind.\u201d",
      "Trump's campaign rejoiced when they heard the clip, which they quickly cut into ads.",
      "Harris, they believed, failed to articulate a forward-looking agenda that represented a break from the unpopular incumbent. And she struggled to distance herself from some of the far-left positions she had taken during the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 sometimes denying positions she was on record as having taken, or failing to offer a clear explanation for her change of heart.",
      "She spent much of the final stretch of the campaign reverting to Biden\u2019s strategy of casting Trump as a fundamental threat to democracy.",
      "But the country made clear it was \"ready to move in a different direction,\u201d said longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski. \u201cThey want someone who\u2019s going to change. They don\u2019t have to think back 20 or 30 years. They can think back to four and five years ago. And they want that back in the White House.\u201d",
      "After his 2020 loss, Trump's campaign worked to grow his appeal beyond the white working-class base that had delivered his first victory. The campaign would court young people and Black and Latino men, including many who rarely voted but felt like they weren't getting ahead. They seized on divisions in the Democratic Party, courting both Jewish voters and Muslims.",
      "In a scene that would have seemed unthinkable eight years ago, Trump \u2014 the man who called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\" entering the country and later perused targeted travel bans \u2014 appeared onstage at his last rally of the campaign with Amer Ghalib, the Democratic, Arab American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan. Days earlier, Trump had gone to the majority Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, for a campaign stop.",
      "\u201cThey saw him as their last hope to end these wars in the Middle East and bring back peace. And this was made very clear when he came to Dearborn,\" said Massad Boulos, the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who led Trump\u2019s outreach with Arab Americans. He noted Harris \"didn\u2019t even come close to Dearborn.\u201d",
      "Trump received another boost when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse either candidate, citing a lack of consensus among its 1.3 million members.",
      "While much of the campaign's messaging centered on the economy and immigration, Trump also tried to court voters with giveaways, promising to end taxes on tips, on overtime pay and on Social Security benefits.",
      "And his aides seized on the culture wars surrounding transgender rights, pouring money into ads aimed at young men \u2014 especially young Hispanic men \u2014 attacking Harris for supporting \u201ctaxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,\" including one spot featuring popular radio host Charlamagne tha God that aired predominantly during football games.",
      "\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\" the narrator said.",
      "Trump's campaign succeeded in its mission, picking up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters, and forging a new working-class coalition crossing racial lines.",
      "\u201cThey came from all quarters: union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American,\u201d Trump in his victory speech. \u201cWe had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment, uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense.\u201d",
      "The campaign decided early that it would focus much of its efforts on low-propensity voters \u2014 people who rarely turn out to the polls and are more likely to get their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "To reach them, Trump began a podcast blitz, appearing with hosts who are popular with young men, including Adin Ross, Theo Von and Joe Rogan. He attended football games and UFC fights, where audiences erupted into cheers at arrivals broadcast live on sports channels.",
      "The campaign also worked to create viral moments. Trump paid a visit to McDonald's, where he donned an apron, manned the fry station and served supporters through the drive-through window. Days later he delivered a news conference from the passenger seat of a garbage truck, while wearing a yellow safety vest.",
      "Clips of those appearances racked up hundreds of millions of views on platforms like TikTok, which Trump embraced, despite having tried to previously ban the app at the White House.",
      "The appearances helped to highlight an aspect of Trump's appeal that is often lost on those who aren't supporters.",
      "Jaden Wurn, 20, a student at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania who was casting his ballot for Trump, said he was drawn to the former president in part because of his sense of humor.",
      "\u201cTrump is able to just chat,\" he said. \u201cIt can be policy. It can be culture. It could be golf. It could be whatever it is, and he\u2019s just able to sit down and have a nice, good conversation. Be relatable. Crack some jokes. He\u2019s a funny guy. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d",
      "Unlike past campaigns marked by backstabbing and turnover, Trump's operation was widely praised for being his most competent and disciplined, with credit given to Florida operative Susie Wiles, who will now serve as his White House chief of staff.",
      "Haunted by lessons from 2020, aides were careful to save money for the race's final stretch even as they were dramatically outraised by Democrats and shelled out millions on legal expenses.",
      "And they took risks, including outsourcing a large portion of their paid get-out-the-vote operation to outside groups, taking advantage of an FEC ruling that allowed unprecedented coordination with a PAC formed by billionaire Elon Musk, his newest benefactor, and Charlie Kirk's Turning Point group.",
      "As the race headed into the race's final stretch, Trump's team continued to project confidence, even as public polling showing a dead heat. They were on offensive, scheduling rallies in Democratic states like Virginia and New Mexico, as well as what was intended to be the marquee event of the campaign's end: a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden.",
      "But the event \u2014 which Trump had talked of for years \u2014 was derailed long before he even took the stage as a series of pre-show speakers delivered vile, crude and racist insults, including a comedian who called Puerto Rico \u201ca floating pile of garbage.\u201d",
      "Trump was livid, angry that the event had been overshadowed by vetting failures and he was being attacked for something he hadn't said.",
      "While aides insisted they saw no impact on their polling \u2014 their internal data had him leading through the final three weeks of the race, albeit with a razor-thin margin \u2014 even Trump's most diehard supporters expressed concerns that the fallout was resonating with undecided friends and family members.",
      "\u201cA couple of them were making the comment that he was against Puerto Rico or he\u2019s racist and I\u2019ve been trying to educate them,\u201d said Donna Sheets, 51, a caregiver who lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, describing friends who had yet to make up their minds in the race's final stretch.",
      "But yet again Trump caught a break. Biden, in a call organized by a Hispanic advocacy group, responded to the insults by calling Trump's supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Trump quickly seized on the gaffe, coming up with the idea of hiring a garbage truck to ride in. Aides quickly scrambled to find a truck and print a \u201cTrump\u201d campaign decal to tape to its side.",
      "They also presented him with an orange worker's vest \u2014 which he decided he liked so much that he continued to wear it onstage at a subsequent rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Supporters began showing up at his rallies wearing their own vests and garbage bags.",
      "Still, Trump continued what felt, at times, like self-sabotage. He doubled down on his controversial pledge to \u201cprotect women,\" saying he would do so whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d He railed against former Rep. Liz Cheney, saying she would be less inclined to send Americans into war if she experienced what it felt like to be standing with nine rifles \u201ctrained at her face.\u201d",
      "And on the Sunday before the election, at a rally in Pennsylvania, an exhausted Trump, fully unleashed, abandoned his stump speech altogether to deliver a profane and conspiracy-laden diatribe in which he said he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 loss and wouldn't mind much if reporters were shot.",
      "The performance was so unhinged that Wiles was spotted coming out to stare at Trump as he spoke.",
      "While aides were alarmed, they urged him to stick with the plan. Trump, onstage the next day, seemed to acknowledge their efforts as he repeated a familiar complaint about how he\u2019s not allowed to call women \u201cbeautiful\u201d anymore, and then asked that it be struck from the record \u2014 saying, \u201cSo I\u2019m allowed to do that, aren\u2019t I, Susan Wiles?\u201d",
      "As his top aides huddled upstairs in his office at Mar-a-Lago, Trump spent much of election night holding court with friends and club members as well as Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 leaders of a new Make America Great Again majority that bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of old.",
      "While aides described him as confident, Trump watched the TVs that had been set up in the ballroom intensely as he mingled. This was more than an election, friends noted. He was fighting for his freedom. He will be able to end the federal investigations he faces as soon as he takes office.",
      "After Fox News had called the race, Trump emerged, flanked by campaign staff and family.",
      "\u201cThis will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their country,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea deals again, McCall's ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in exchange for the guilty pleas.",
      "Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the agreements.",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this summer.",
      "Within days, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.",
      "Lawdragon, a legal news site that long has covered the courtroom proceedings from Guantanamo, and The New York Times first reported the ruling.",
      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. But Lawdragon said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals, and acted too late, after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals.",
      "Abiding by Austin\u2019s order would give defense secretaries \u201cabsolute veto power\u201d over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials, the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling.",
      "While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it's not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.",
      "The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin\u2019s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by \u201cclean teams\u201d of FBI agents that did not involve violence.",

The couple, married for more than half a century, were later found dead, clinging to a tree and to each other.",
      "Wright County Sheriff Sonny Byerley said the Baldwins \u2014 who regularly volunteered to help in elections \u2014 tried to swim to dry ground but drowned, among at least five people killed Tuesday as torrential rains drenched the state.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019d go to the polling locations, they were there and they were always happy to be a part of it,\" said Byerley, who polices the county of about 19,000 residents, 210 miles (340 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City. \u201cThey did believe in the American republic and the polling system.\u201d",
      "The state's highway patrol and the sheriff have not released their names, saying only that the man who died was 70 and the woman was 73. But the Baldwins' daughter, Michelle Baldwin-Bostian, of North Carolina, confirmed their identities Wednesday.",
      "News spread fast among the couple's friends in tiny, tightknit unincorporated Manes, Missouri, where voters filled out their ballots in a music hall that regularly hosts performances by local artists.",
      "In this heavily Republican-leaning community, the Baldwins were rare Democrats, which is why they were tapped to join a bipartisan team working the polls, said 52-year-old Patty Squirell, who worked with Cathie Baldwin at a liquor store in nearby Mountain Grove.",
      "\u201cCathie was an angel here on earth,\u201d she said. \"She was so nonjudgmental and so loving and so kind. And we\u2019re all in deep mourning.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t go wrong with either one of them,\u201d Ledford said. \u201cChuck stood up for the innocent, and Cathie would feed the poor. She did. I watched her do it. No one went hungry around her.\u201d",
      "Lindsi Snyder, a teacher at Manes Elementary, said her parents were close to the Baldwins. She described how Chuck wasn't even 18 when he met Cathie and that the besotted young couple decided very quickly that they wanted to marry.",
      "In 2022, Cathie Baldwin marked their 52nd wedding anniversary with a Facebook post calling Chuck \u201cthe love of my life.\u201d",
      "The sheriff said the Baldwins were driving in the dark on a two-lane highway around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when their car was suddenly swept away by floodwaters from the fast-rising Beaver Creek.",
      "Three teenage boys in another car that was swept away at about the same time were able to swim to safety, and they knocked on the door of a nearby house to call 911. Byerley said the boys then returned to the surging water to try to reach the Baldwins.",
      "\u201cThey were out of their car, clinging to a tree,\u201d Byerley said of the couple.",
      "But the current was too strong and the teens couldn\u2019t get to them.",
      "Byerley used a drone and spotted the hugging couple holding onto low-lying tree limbs, but rescuers were unable to reach them in time. Cathie and Chuck died in each other's arms, the sheriff said.",

    "summary": "Amazon workers in Alabama will have the opportunity decide whether to unionize for the third time in three years",
    "story": [
      "Amazon workers in Alabama will have the opportunity decide whether to unionize for the third time in three years",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Amazon workers in Alabama will decide for the third time in three years whether to unionize after a federal judge ruled that the retail giant improperly influenced the most recent vote in which employees rejected a union.",
      "Administrative law judge Michael Silverstein on Tuesday ordered the third vote for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Birmingham, after determining that Amazon committed six violations leading up to the second election in March 2022.",
      "Amazon managers surveilled employees' union activities and threatened workers with plant closure if they voted with the union, Silverstein said in an 87-page decision. Amazon managers also removed pro-union materials from areas where anti-union materials were available, the judge determined.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board also found improper interference in the first election in 2021, leading to the redo in 2022.",
      "Silverstein\u2019s decision comes after months of testimony and is the latest development in a nationwide legal battle involving Amazon, the National Labor Relations Board and unions spearheading unionization efforts. Some states, like California, have fined the mega retailer for labor violations.",
      "Both Amazon and the union that organized the vote in Bessemer said that they would appeal the judge's order.",
      "The president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Stuart Appelbaum, affirmed the court's findings that Amazon broke labor laws.",
      "But he also said that he believed Amazon was likely to commit similar violations in a third election if the court did not order \u201csignificant and meaningful remedies\u201d to protect the vote.",
      "Specifically, the union requested access to private meetings between Amazon representatives and workers, as well as training for Amazon supervisors on labor laws. The judge declined those requests.",
      "\u201cThe record reveals that there are over a hundred managers at BHM1, but my findings of unfair labor practices are limited to four managers, who each committed isolated unfair labor practice,\u201d the judge ruled, referring to the Bessemer facility.",
      "Appelbaum said that the union would appeal that decision.",
      "\u201cAmazon must be held accountable, and we\u2019ll be filing accordingly,\u201d Appelbaum said.",
      "Mary Kate Paradis, a spokesperson for Amazon, said the company vehemently disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling and indicated that there would be an appeal.",
      "\u201cOur team at BHM1 has already made their choice clear, twice that they don\u2019t want a Union. This decision is wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d Paradis said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the NLRB and RWDSU keep trying to force a third vote instead of accepting the facts and the will of our team members.\u201d",
      "With approximately 6,000 employees, Bessemer in 2021 became the largest U.S. facility to vote on unionization in Amazon's over 20-year history. Since then, similar battles have ensued at Amazon facilities across the country.",

      "Republicans running on the ballot underneath President-elect Donald Trump have made gains in numerous state legislatures",
      "Republicans running on the ballot underneath President-elect Donald Trump made gains in numerous state legislative chambers, though Democrats also notched a few victories in an expensive battle for state power.",
      "The most notable change from Tuesday's elections came in Michigan, where Republicans won back the House just two years after Democrats claimed full control of both legislative chambers and the governor's office for the first time in 40 years. Republicans also appeared on track to force a tie with Democrats in the Minnesota House, which would break a Democratic trifecta won two years ago.",
      "Democrats had flexed their powers in the upper Midwestern states to enact a sweeping agenda supporting abortion rights, gun control, union bargaining powers and more. That will likely end under a new era of split partisan control.",
      "Votes were still being counted Thursday in some states, including Arizona, where Republicans were trying to defend slim majorities in both legislative chambers against an aggressive campaign by Democratic-aligned groups. In Pennsylvania, Democrats were trying to hold on to a one-seat majority in the House while Republicans retained control of the Senate.",
      "Nationally, Republicans will continue to hold a majority of state legislative chambers and governor's offices. None of the 11 governorships up for election flipped control. Overall, it appears there will be only modest change in the composition of state legislatures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republicans touted that as a big achievement.",
      "\u201cRepublicans at the state level were definitive winners all across the country,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, adding that \u201cRepublicans are well positioned to advance conservative policies in the states.\u201d",
      "Though few chambers flipped control Tuesday, the parties waged a fierce battle over the strength of their majorities.",
      "When one party holds a supermajority, it has margins so large that it can enact laws despite a governor\u2019s veto, convene special sessions or place constitutional amendments on the ballot without needing any support from lawmakers of an opposing party.",
      "Republicans appeared to gain enough seats Tuesday to achieve new supermajorities in Iowa and South Carolina and break up existing Democratic supermajorities in New York and Vermont. The Vermont victories were particularly meaningful, because they will fortify Republican Gov. Phil Scott's veto pen. In June, Democrats overrode six of Scott's vetoes, including ones concerning a 14% average property tax increase and a requirement for state utilities to shift to renewable energy.",
      "Vermont House Speaker Jill Krowinski, a Democrat, said it's essential for Democrats to \u201ctake stock of the messages sent by the voters.\u201d",
      "Yet Democrats also claimed some successes. They appeared on track to gain a legislative supermajority in Connecticut and made significant gains in Republican-led legislatures in Montana and Wisconsin, where they were running for the first time under new district maps that gave them a better shot at winning.",
      "Democrats also appeared on track to pick up a seat in the North Carolina House, which would prevent Republicans from being able to singlehandedly override vetoes by Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Stein.",
      "North Carolina was a big target for Democrats, because Republicans overrode more than two dozen vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, including on legislation barring most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and restricting medical treatments and sports activities for transgender youths.",
      "Though was \u201ca brutal night for Democrats\u201d at the national level, the party \u201cheld onto more ground than would have been expected\" in state legislatures, the Democratic-aligned group Forward Majority said in a statement.",
      "The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Forward Majority and The States Project, which is another Democratic-aligned group, collectively poured about $175 million into state legislative races \u2014 outspending national Republican-aligned groups. Those efforts \u201cprevented a Republican wave from taking shape in our state legislatures,\u201d said Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.",
      "Democrats had hoped to break additional Republican supermajorities, including in Kansas. But Republicans instead appeared on track to add to their power there. Republicans called the result a repudiation of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, whose Middle of the Road political action committee spent about $2 million trying to break the supermajority.",
      "The closely divided New Hampshire legislature also shifted rightward, even though a slim majority of voters there backed Democrat Kamala Harris for president. Heading into the election, Republicans held a majority of just a few seats in the 400-member House, the nation's largest chamber. But they will have a majority of several dozen seats in that chamber and a new supermajority in the Senate.",
      "In heavily Democratic Massachusetts, Republicans also were celebrating several wins. Since 1984, only one Republican has flipped a state legislative seat in a presidential election year, according to Massachusetts Republican Party Chair Amy Carnevale. On Tuesday, the party flipped three legislative seats, though Democrats still hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers and the governor's office.",

      "Voters in Portland, Oregon, have elected political outsider Keith Wilson as their next mayor",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Voters in Portland, Oregon, have elected political outsider Keith Wilson as their new mayor, following a campaign in which he capitalized on years of growing frustration over homeless encampments, open drug use and quality of life concerns to outperform three City Council members \u2014 including one ensnared in a driving record scandal \u2014 who had also sought to lead the city.",
      "Wilson, the CEO of a trucking company and founder of a nonprofit working to increase homeless shelter capacity, ran on an ambitious pledge to end unsheltered homelessness within a year of taking office. The Portland native says he will accomplish this in part by increasing the number of nighttime walk-in emergency shelters in existing facilities such as churches and community centers.",
      "His message appears to have resonated in a city where surveys conducted over the past few years have shown that residents view homelessness as a top issue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to end unsheltered homelessness and open drug use, and it\u2019s time to restore public safety in Portland,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech Thursday, speaking at a community center in north Portland that has also served as an emergency overnight shelter during extreme cold and heat waves. \"Voters aren\u2019t interested in pointing fingers. They just want us to get things done.\"",
      "The mayoral race, which featured 19 candidates, was thrown open when Mayor Ted Wheeler decided against seeking reelection after holding the city\u2019s top post since 2017. Wheeler rose to national prominence in 2020 as nightly protests erupted on Portland streets and around the country in response to the the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "Wilson won in an election in which Portland voters used ranked-choice voting for the first time. Under ranked-choice voting, voters rank their picks in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate wins.",
      "Otherwise, the count continues to a second round. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. The process continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.",
      "About 35% of voters ranked Wilson as their first choice, according to the first and second rounds of preliminary results released Tuesday and Wednesday. That is compared with City Council members Carmen Rubio and Rene Gonzalez, who were ranked first by roughly 19% of voters, and Mingus Mapps, ranked first by some 13% of voters.",
      "Rubio and Gonzalez said they called Wilson to congratulate him on his new role.",
      "For much of the year, the two City Council members were viewed as frontrunners. But recent revelations about Rubio\u2019s driving record \u2014 as well as Gonzalez\u2019s, to a much lesser extent \u2014 shook up the race.",
      "Rubio has received roughly 150 parking and traffic violations over the last two decades. She failed to pay many of them for months or even years and had her license suspended six times. She lost some endorsements following the news, which was first reported by The Oregonian/OregonLive.",
      "Gonzalez also had his license suspended twice over 20 years ago and racked up seven speeding tickets between 1998 and 2013, including one that was dismissed, as first reported by Willamette Week.",
      "In previous statements, Rubio apologized for her actions, and Gonzalez said he had grown more responsible with age.",
      "Wilson will oversee a completely new system of government. Portland is expanding its City Council from five to 12 members, elected by voters in individual districts rather than citywide, and adding a city manager position."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",
      "The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "When inflation is high, the Bank may decide to raise rates to keep it at or near the 2% target.",
      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand.",
      "Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "When will UK interest rates go down further?",
      "The current Bank rate is 4.75%, after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years.",
      "However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, hitting 17% in November 1979, external.",
      "Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, rose by 1.7% in the 12 months to September 2024 which was down from 2.2% in August. This means prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers.",
      "It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards.",
      "How much could interest rates fall?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as this depends whether inflation remains consistently below the Bank's target.",
      "The picture has altered following October's Budget by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. It included plans to borrow and spend billions of pounds, so financial markets and the Bank expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated.",
      "Some retailers have also suggested prices could rise owing to the extra burden of tax they face.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race is also likely to have an impact on prices globally owing to his position on tariffs, and this will influence the Bank of England's decision making in the coming months.",

      "Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.42%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts. A five-year deal is 5.13%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",

      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",

      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

      "\"We believe this deal has the potential to be pro-competitive for the UK mobile sector if our concerns are addressed,\" said Stuart McIntosh, who is leading the CMA panel investigating the merger.",
      "\"We anticipate in the longer term that the significant commitment to upgrade the merged companies network over the next 10 years or so will ultimately create a competitive environment that will maintain the competition we've seen in mobile in recent years,\" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.",
      "But he also made clear that short term commitments not to increase the price of certain existing mobile tariffs and data plans for at least three years were also key to making sure consumers did not lose out.",

      "Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC it marked \"another key step towards approval\" and showed all concerned were trying to find a way to make the deal happen.",
      "The two largest players in the market are currently EE and 02 - Mr Pescatore said a merged Vodafone and Three would be in a better place to take them on.",
      "\"To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,\" he said.",

      "In a report, the body in charge of linking new projects to the grid said Labour's target to decarbonise electricity by 2030 was \"achievable\" but a \"huge challenge\".",
      "It will warn that infrastructure for the electricity network will need to be built much faster than it has been over the last decade to meet the pledge.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said ministers were committed to \"significant reforms\" of the planning system to speed up new connections.",
      "Faster grid hook-ups planned for some green energy projects",
      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "Miliband asked the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to review ministers' clean energy plans after Labour's return to power at July's general election.",
      "The body was originally owned by National Grid, a private company, but transferred to government ownership last month.",
      "The government is expected to publish its action plan for modernising the grid in the coming months.",
      "Sources within government see its report, to be published on Tuesday, as a vindication of its pledge to deliver a net zero carbon electricity system in Great Britain by 2030, a key part of Labour's election manifesto.",
      "But it also highlights the scale of the task when it comes to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and connecting it to the grid.",
      "Meeting the pledge, it finds, would require a significant boost to offshore wind capacity, alongside increased electrification of heat, transport and industry.",
      "Nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of new power lines would be required to connect new renewable energy to the grid, along with 4,800 km of undersea cables, it said.",

      "The GMB union, which represents oil and gas workers and donates to Labour, said any government plans to boost wind and solar power should come with a \"cast iron commitment to delivering quality jobs here\".",
      "Impact on bills",
      "NESO's report estimated that the 2030 clean energy plan would require an average of \u00a340bn in investment a year, most of it from the private sector, requiring a significant boost from current levels.",
      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",
      "The exact timing of any drop in costs depends on how quickly clean energy infrastructure can be built and related policy decisions, the report said.",
      "It argued that consumer costs were unlikely to rise, as fixed prices for renewable projects would offset reduced natural gas needs.",
      "It also said the 2030 target would depend on a four to fivefold expansion of its demand flexibility service, under which households and firms are encouraged to save money by using less electricity at busy times.",

      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",

      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",

      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",

      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",

      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",

      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "Angela Frazer-Wicks\u2019 two sons were removed from her care and adopted in 2004, when they were aged five and one. She was in an abusive relationship and had problems with addiction and her mental health.",
      "By 2011 Angela had recovered, she was in a new relationship, and had a baby daughter. The local authority was not involved in her daughter\u2019s care.",

But when the older of the two boys became a teenager, he told his adoptive mother he no longer wanted to write to his birth mother. Angela carried on sending cards, but heard nothing back for years.",
      "Then out of the blue, in 2020, Angela received an email from her eldest son. It turned out he had been trying to contact her, but the local authority had told him that wasn\u2019t possible.",

      "Adoption is the state\u2019s most powerful intervention in family life. It is a permanent break between a child and their birth family, and alters the child's identity forever.  In law they are no longer the child of their birth parents, and most adopted children grow up without seeing or knowing any of their birth family.",
      "Around 3,000 children are adopted in England each year. It\u2019s a process that must be authorised by judges in family courts, who set out the level of contact the child will have with their birth parents - usually just letters, sent twice a year, via an intermediary.",
      "While adoption law has evolved over the years - allowing children to know more about their history than they once did, in some ways, families say, adoption is still very much stuck in the past.",

    "story": [
      "UK students will pay more for university in England next year, as undergraduate tuition fees rise to \u00a39,535 a year.",
      "It is an increase of \u00a3285 on the fees, which have been frozen at a maximum of \u00a39,250 since 2017.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told MPs in Parliament on Monday that maintenance loans would also go up to help students manage the cost of living.",
      "The National Union of Students called the tuition fees rise a \"sticking plaster\", but said higher maintenance loans \"will make a real difference to the poorest students\".",
      "For universities, the higher fees are a cash injection to assist with their most immediate financial challenges.",
      "However, the announcement only affects fees and loans in the 2025/26 academic year \u2013 and vice-chancellors will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",
      "Phillipson said the government would announce further \"major reform\" for long-term investment in universities in the coming months.",
      "She said the government was having to \"take the tough decisions needed to put universities on a firmer financial footing\".",
      "But she told the BBC they would also be \"demanding more of universities\", and looking at things like how much top bosses are paid, in order to \"drive better value for students and for the taxpayer\".",

      "When are UK student loans written off?",
      "How much does university cost in the UK?",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer had said he wanted to abolish tuition fees altogether when he ran for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2020.",
      "But in 2023, he said Labour was \"likely to move on\" from the pledge. In this year's general election campaign, he confirmed he would be doing so as he wanted to prioritise spending on the NHS.",
      "In the Commons on Monday, Conservative shadow education secretary Laura Trott called the tuition fee rise \u201ca hike in the effective tax graduates have to pay\u201d.",
      "Next year both tuition fees and maintenance loans will be linked to a measure of inflation called RPIX, which counts the cost of everything except mortgage interest costs.",
      "It is currently set at 3.1%.",
      "That will increase maintenance loan caps from \u00a310,227 to \u00a310,544 for students living away from their parents outside of London, and from \u00a313,348 to \u00a313,762 in London.",
      "Maintenance grants, which were non-repayable, were scrapped in 2016.",
      "In their analysis of the changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the tuition fees increase would spare universities a further real-terms cut to their teaching resources.",
      "But they urged the government to say whether fees would continue to increase after next year, \"to provide some certainty to universities and prospective students alike\".",
      "They also said that, under current repayment terms, around a quarter of the extended loans would eventually be written off and paid by the taxpayer.",
      "Although students taking out the highest possible maintenance loans would be getting more money next year, the IFS said they would still be borrowing 9% less in real terms than they would have done in 2020/21.",
      "The changes announced on Monday will affect students starting university next year, as well as current students - although universities can have contracts that protect their students from fee hikes part-way through a course.",
      "Students Shay and Zay, both in their first year studying product design at Manchester Metropolitan University, said higher fees could put off prospective students.",
      "Zay said tuition fees were \"already quite a big factor playing on a lot of people's minds\" when deciding whether to go to university.",
      "Shay said university was \"already expensive as it is\", but added that he was more worried about his maintenance money being able to cover the cost of living.",
      "Personal finance expert Martin Lewis has said the tuition fee changes are \"likely to be trivial\", especially compared with students who started university in 2023.",
      "Last year, loan terms were increased from 30 to 40 years and repayment threshold salaries were dropped from \u00a327,295 to \u00a325,000, meaning more graduates would be repaying their loans for longer.",
      "Tom Allingham, from the Save the Student money advice website, said that despite their \"dismay\" at the increase in fees, it would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",
      "That sentiment was reflected by sixth formers in Oldham considering their university choices for next year.",
      "Niamh, who wants to study English literature, said tuition fees were not rising by a \"huge amount\", but that maintenance loan increases were \"definitely needed\" to support students.",
      "She said costs for university students were \"ridiculous\", so \"even a little bit of extra support is welcome\".",
      "James, who wants to study engineering, said he thought it was \"unfair\" that he was going to have to work to help fund his living costs at university, even with the increased maintenance loans.",
      "Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, a financial services firm, said parents of young children should start saving now for their university years.",
      "She advised parents of older children to \"be clear about what level of financial support they can expect from you\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 141 universities, said the government's decision to change tuition fees was \"the right thing to do\".",
      "She said the freeze had been \"completely unsustainable for both students and universities\".",
      "But Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said raising tuition fees was \"economically and morally wrong\" and that the government was \"taking more money from debt-ridden students\" to support universities.",
      "The changes come after growing concerns about the state of university finances in the UK.",
      "The Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, warned that 40% of universities have predicted a deficit in this academic year.",
      "In July, Phillipson said universities should \u201cmanage their budgets\u201d amid calls for the government to bail out struggling institutions.",
      "Universities UK has previously suggested tuition fees would need to rise to \u00a312,500 a year to adequately meet teaching costs.",
      "But they also acknowledged that asking for that amount would seem \"clueless\" and \"out of touch\".",
      "The government hopes that increasing maintenance support will help students with day-to-day living costs like food and accommodation.",
      "But higher tuition fees and increased maintenance loans will mean students need to borrow more to go to university, and will leave with more debt.",
      "The Department for Education will publish an impact assessment soon, alongside legislation setting out the changes. It will look at the impact of the changes on students' debt at graduation, and their repayments over time.",
      "The tripling of fees in England in 2012 prompted widespread protests.",

    "summary": "India\u2019s ban on the import of Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses is under scrutiny - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones lived for 50 years after attending his own memorial service.",
      "When the musician suffered a brain aneurysm in 1974, his chances of survival were said to be so slim, and his stature so high, that his famous friends started planning a tribute concert.",
      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",
      "When he pulled through, the show went ahead anyway.",
      "Jones went along, accompanied by his neurologist, who gave strict instructions not to get too excited.",
      "\"That was hard to do with Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan and Sidney Poitier singing your praises,\" he told Newsweek in 2008.",
      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",
      "Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr, while his solo album Body Heat reached the US top 10.",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "Quincy Jones, giant of US music, has died aged 91",
      "Meanwhile, he was forging a career writing soundtracks for TV shows and films including In Cold Blood, The Italian Job and Roots.",
      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "BBC Sounds: Remembering Quincy Jones",
      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",

      "Luna Kids Casting held auditions in April, July and October 2023, with pop-up banners in the Wigan studio suggesting children signed by Jamie went on to work for Cbeebies, Sky, Disney and Fox.",

      "Health assessment body NICE has stressed to GPs hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered as the first treatment option to ease menopause symptoms.",
      "In its updated guidance, the use of talking therapy is set out as an additional method of help.",
      "After a detailed analysis of data on links between HRT and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers and dementia, NICE concluded HRT does not affect life expectancy.",
      "The guidance includes a new discussion aid to help GPs give patients the most useful information they can about the HRT drugs and what they do.",
      "HRT replaces the hormones oestrogen or progestogen, or both, when women's periods stop - normally between the ages of 45 and 55.",
      "It is administered using gels, creams, pessaries, tablets, patches or sprays and is sometimes prescribed during perimenopause, as the hormones start to fluctuate but before menstruation stops altogether.",

      "The guidance is clear that HRT is the go-to treatment option for hot flushes and night sweats caused by the menopause.",
      "Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is to be offered to women over 40 alongside HRT or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.",
      "That is a change from draft guidelines, published in late 2023, which caused controversy by suggesting that talking therapy could replace HRT as a treatment.",
      "The level of feedback received by NICE on that point led to a longer than usual delay in issuing the final guidance.",
      "The document highlights that while there are some increased risks linked to taking HRT, it is unlikely to lengthen or shorten overall life expectancy.",
      "Easy-to-read illustrations of the likelihood of developing certain health conditions are featured. These are intended to help GPs have informed conversations with patients.",
      "Dr Marie Anne Ledingham, consultant clinical adviser to NICE, explained that an independent panel assessed available scientific evidence to come up with the information.",
      "She said the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and ovarian and endometrial cancer was no higher among women aged 45 and over taking combined HRT, compared to those who had never taken it.",
      "And HRT actually reduced the risk of fractures linked to the bone condition osteoporosis, which is more likely to develop after the menopause.",
      "But the risk of breast cancer for women did rise slightly, affecting:",

    "summary": "The government says it wants to mitigate the \"harm\" social media is inflicting on children.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "The debate: Should smartphones be banned for under 16s?",
      "US states want to ban phones in schools. It might be a challenge",
      "How mobile phones have changed our brains",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",
      "\"These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is part of an overhaul of decades-old mental health legislation in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Police will no longer be able to hold people who are being detained for mental-health reasons in police cells, under government plans for England and Wales.",
      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"outdated\" system was in need of changes to bring it \"in line with the 21st Century\".",
      "'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on'",
      "'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled",
      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

      "Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris, 48, has advanced cancer that has spread to his bones and is terminal.",
      "In his first TV interview since announcing his condition, Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast how people with a strong family history should consider seeing their GP for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test to help spot the disease.",
      "PSA tests are not routinely offered to men under 50 without symptoms but who may be at risk. Doctors are instead told to use their judgement.",

      "\"Right now, you need to be aware of this and bring it up with a GP yourself. As prostate cancer often has no symptoms in its earlier stages this is leading to too many men getting a late, incurable diagnosis - like Sir Chris.\"",
      "Sir Chris spoke of the \"absolute shock and horror\" he felt at his initial diagnosis.",
      "The news that he had a terminal illness, in September 2023, came \"completely out the blue\".",

      "And he spoke of the \"nightmare\" of learning wife Sarra had multiple sclerosis, and having to break the news to their two young children.",
      "\"We just tried to be positive and tried to say 'Do you know what? This is what we're doing and you can help because when I'm not feeling well, you can come and give me cuddles, you can be supportive, you can be happy, you can be kind to each other'.\"",

      "\"It's been the toughest year of our lives so far by some stretch,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Maybe people seeing this or hearing about my story - just by them asking their GP - will create enough of a surge of interest that people that make the decisions will go 'you know what, we need to address this'. And in the long term this will save potentially millions of lives.\"",
      "He added: \"I know what the end result will be. Nobody lives forever. Our time on this planet is finite. Don't waste your time worrying about stuff that isn't that important. Focus on the things that are.",
      "\"My perspective on life has changed massively. I am more thankful, I'm more grateful for each day. It's been a tough year and it's going to be tough ahead in the future too but for now, right here right now, we're doing pretty well.\"",
      "The NHS advises men to speak to a doctor if they think they are higher risk of prostate cancer. A man's risk of this cancer increases with age.",
      "Cancer Research UK says the evidence so far suggests that routinely screening people using PSA would not greatly help prevent deaths and might instead lead to men having unnecessary treatment that could cause undue stress and potential side effects.",
      "PSA is not diagnostic. A raised PSA level does not necessarily mean there is cancer. It can be elevated with other conditions too, such as inflammation.",
      "If you ask for a PSA test, your doctor may advise you to think carefully about the benefits and disadvantages.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists believe they have found a quirky way to fight mosquito-spread diseases such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika - by turning male insects deaf so they struggle to mate and breed.",
      "Mosquitoes have sex while flying in mid-air and the males rely on hearing to chase down a female, based on her attractive wingbeats.",
      "The researchers did an experiment, altering a genetic pathway that male mosquitoes use for this hearing. The result - they made no physical contact with females, even after three days in the same cage.",
      "Female mosquitoes are the ones that spread diseases to people, and so trying to prevent them having babies would help reduce overall numbers.",
      "The team from the University of California, Santa Barbara, studied Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread viruses to around 400 million people a year.",
      "They closely observed the insects' aerial mating habits - that can last between a few seconds to just under a minute - and then figured out how to disrupt it using genetics.",
      "They targeted a protein called trpVa that appears to be essential for hearing.",
      "In the mutated mosquitoes, neurons normally involved in detecting sound showed no response to the flight tones or wingbeats of potential mates.",
      "The alluring noise fell on deaf ears.",
      "In contrast, wild (non-mutant) males were quick to copulate, multiple times, and fertilised nearly all the females in their cage.",
      "The researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, who have published their work in the journal PNAS, said the effect of the gene knock-out was \"absolute\", as mating by deaf males was entirely eliminated.",
      "Dr Joerg Albert, from the University of Oldenburg in Germany, is an expert on mosquito mating and I asked him what he made of the research.",
      "He said attacking sense of sound was a promising route for mosquito control, but it needed to be studied and managed.",
      "\"The study provides a first direct molecular test, which suggests that hearing is indeed not only important for mosquito reproduction but essential.",
      "\"Without the ability of males to hear - and acoustically chase - female mosquitoes might become extinct.\"",
      "Another method being explored is releasing sterile males in areas where there are pockets of mosquito-spread diseases, he added.",
      "Although mosquitoes can carry diseases, they are an important part of the food chain - as nourishment for fish, birds, bats and frogs, for example - and some are important pollinators."

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has tightened the rules on ministers accepting gifts and hospitality, after a row over senior Labour figures receiving freebies.",
      "Ministers will not be banned from accepting gifts but the ministerial code has been updated to require them to consider the \"need to maintain the public's confidence in the standards of propriety\" when deciding whether to do so.",
      "A register of gifts received by ministers will now also be published monthly, rather than quarterly.",
      "Since winning power in July, Sir Keir and other cabinet ministers have faced criticism for accepting gifts from wealthy donors.",
      "Last month, Sir Keir paid back more than \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since becoming prime minister, including tickets to see Taylor Swift, following the backlash.",
      "He has also faced scrutiny for receiving thousands of pounds of clothes from Labour peer and donor Lord Alli, who has gifted clothing to a number of ministers as well as the PM's wife.",

      "Lord Alli: Labour donor reluctantly in the spotlight",
      "Labour insiders frustrated at Starmer's 'breathtaking' wardrobe row",
      "The updated ministerial code states that it is a \"well-established and recognised rule that ministers should not accept any gifts, hospitality or service which would, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence their work in government\".",
      "The same principle applies to members of a minister's family.",
      "However, it points out that ministers have a responsibility to represent the government and their duties will sometimes require them to attend events where hospitality may be offered.",
      "The code adds that it is \"primarily a matter of judgement for ministers who are personally responsible for deciding how to act\" in relation to accepting gifts.",
      "The monthly register will include details and the value of gifts worth more than \u00a3140, as well as hospitality, received and given by ministers in their ministerial capacity.",
      "It comes as the latest list of ministers' interests revealed the prime minister is renting out his family home in north London after moving into Downing Street.",
      "Sir Keir is not the first prime minister to do so - David Cameron also rented out his family home and Theresa May rented out a flat she owned in central London.",
      "The list includes any relevant private interests which could be perceived to give rise to a conflict with a minister's public duties.",
      "It will now be published more regularly - quarterly rather than twice a year.",
      "Meanwhile, the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, will now have the power to launch investigations into alleged breaches of the code without seeking the consent of the prime minister.",
      "Previously the PM was able to veto investigations by the adviser.",
      "The change was promised in Labour's election manifesto.",
      "The ministerial code sets out the standards that ministers are expected to uphold.",
      "While Sir Laurie advises the prime minister on adherence to the code, Sir Keir has the final decision on whether there has been a breach and what sanctions, if any, are required.",
      "In a foreword to the code, Sir Keir said: \"For a long time, [the British people] have looked at the conduct of politicians in Westminster and not seen the high standards of public service they expect or deserve.\"",
      "He added that the updated code \"sets out the higher standards that the British people expect and that ministers must now follow\"."

      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

    "summary": "Its chair says officials have questions to answer as to why details of an overspend were not shared.",
    "story": [
      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's budget watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC it had acted \"within the law\" but said it had made changes to make sure the \"unidentified pressures... never happen again\".",
      "The Conservative party has been contacted for comment.",
      "Last week, the OBR said the previous government \"did not provide\" them with all available information at former chancellor Jeremy Hunt's last Budget in March.",
      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",
      "Hunt said it was \"impossible to know\" how much of the \u00a39.5bn would have been compensated for by savings elsewhere.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",
      "\"This is enshrined in the new Charter for Budget Responsibility to ensure that the unfunded pressures identified at the Public Spending Audit never happen again.\"",

      "Budget 2024: Key points at a glance",
      "'Workers hit more than employers by NI tax rise'",
      "Separately, the OBR told the committee workers will take most of the hit from the upcoming increase to employers' National Insurance (NI) contributions.",
      "At the Budget, Reeves said employers will pay NI at a rate of 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000 from April, up from 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100.",
      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",
      "However, he suggested that the personal impact for workers might see \"a bit of an offset\" with the increase to minimum wages announced in the Budget.",
      "The OBR's comments come after much debate around Labour's manifesto claim that there would be no tax rises on \"working people\" following its first Budget in 14 years.",
      "James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank, argued that the NI changes were \"definitely a tax on working people\".",
      "\"Even if it doesn't show up in pay packets from day one, it will eventually feed through to lower wages,\" he said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended increasing taxes for employers in last week's Budget while saying she is \"not immune\" to the criticism she has received.",
      "She told the BBC the money raised would help put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",

      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",

      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",

      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",

      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",

      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",
      "A former cabinet minister suggests now we\u2019ll be much less like \u2018the stepping stone\u2019 between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour\u2019s enormous Budget has set new terms.",

      "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.",
      "Her robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.",
      "As the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.",
      "The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power.",
      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",
      "Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.",
      "She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.",
      "After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.",
      "She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.",
      "According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.",
      "She later described student activists there as the \"spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training\".",
      "Badenoch and Jenrick wait for results of Tory leadership race",
      "Chris Mason: Challenges ahead for Kemi Badenoch",
      "Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.",
      "When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.",
      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",
      "Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.",
      "As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.",
      "In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.",
      "\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.",
      "\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.",
      "She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.",
      "As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed.",
      "She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her position\" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.",
      "Badenoch is often labelled a \"culture warrior\" but she disputes the tag.",
      "Sometimes accused of wanting to start a fight in an empty room, she says she does not like to fight - but is prepared to fight to defend Conservative principles.",
      "That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.",
      "During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.",
      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",
      "She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.",
      "But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was \"excessive\". She claimed her words had been \"misrepresented\", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was \"a good thing\".",
      "In 2018, Badenoch admitted that, a decade earlier, she had hacked into the website of then-Commons leader and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as a prank. Harman accepted her apology.",
      "Among public spats, in February, she accused the Post Office chair she had sacked of seeking \"revenge\" by \"making up\" claims he been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.",
      "Henry Staunton said he had been told to stall pay-outs to allow the government to \"limp into the election\", apparently to ease the public finances.",
      "Conservatism 'in crisis'",
      "Nor has Badenoch shied away from public clashes with MPs on her own side - including when she rejected calls to make it illegal to discriminate against people going through the menopause.",
      "Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes \"loads of people\" wanted to use equalities law as \"a tool for different personal agendas and interests\".",
      "During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being \"in crisis\" - under attack from a new \"progressive ideology\" involving \"identity politics\" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and \"the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals\" or elected politicians.",
      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",
      "The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality."

      "A secret recording shows the chief executive of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, discussing \"investment opportunities\" in the state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor.",
      "\"We have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed,\" he says.",
      "A former head of the UN body responsible for the climate talks told the BBC that Soltanov's actions were \"completely unacceptable\" and a \"betrayal\" of the COP process.",
      "As well as being the chief executive of COP29, Soltanov is also the deputy energy minister of Azerbaijan and is on the board of Socar.",
      "Azerbaijan's COP29 team has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Oil and gas accounts for about half of Azerbaijan's total economy and more than 90% of its exports, according to US figures.",
      "COP29 will open in Baku on Monday and is the 29th annual UN climate summit, where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for climate change, and raise global ambition to tackle the issue.",
      "However, this is the second year in a row the BBC has revealed alleged wrongdoing by the host government.",
      "The BBC has been shown documents and secret video recordings made by the human rights organisation, Global Witness.",
      "It is understood that one of its representatives approached the COP29 team posing as the head of a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm specialising in energy.",
      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",
      "However, he said he was open to discussions about deals too \u2013 including on oil and gas.",
      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",
      "It also goes against the agreement the world made at the last global climate summit to transition away from fossil fuels.",

      "Soltanov appeared eager to help get discussions going, telling the potential sponsor: \"I would be happy to create a contact between your team and their team [Socar] so that they can start discussions.\"",
      "A couple of weeks later the fake Hong Kong investment company received an email - Socar wanted to follow up on the lead.",
      "Attempting to do business deals as part of the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards of conduct expected of a COP official.",
      "These events are supposed to be about reducing the world's use of fossil fuels \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 not selling more.",
      "The standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "The UN said it could not comment directly on our findings but remarked that \"the same rigorous standards\" are applied to whoever hosts the conference, and that those standards reflect \"the importance of impartiality on the part of all presiding officers\".",
      "Its code of conduct for COP officials states they are \"expected to act without bias, prejudice, favouritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference, strictly based on sound, independent and fair judgement.",
      "\"They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as a UNFCCC officer.\"",
      "Christiana Figueres, who oversaw the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, told the BBC that she was shocked anyone in the COP process would use their position to strike oil and gas deals.",
      "She said such behaviour was \"contrary and egregious\" to the the purpose of COP and \"a treason\" to the process.",
      "The BBC has also seen emails between the COP29 team and the fake investors.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 03:22:24 GMT",
    "summary": "It is also set to be the world's first breach of 1.5C of warming across an entire calendar year.",
    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",

      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well.

      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "US states want to ban phones in schools. It might be a challenge",
      "How mobile phones have changed our brains",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "The BBC has been shown documents and secret video recordings made by the human rights organisation, Global Witness.",
      "It is understood that one of its representatives approached the COP29 team posing as the head of a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm specialising in energy.",
      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",

      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

    "summary": "India\u2019s ban on the import of Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses is under scrutiny - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

    "summary": "Roman ruins in Lebanon lie just a short distance from sites that have been hit by Israeli air strikes.",
    "story": [
      "For over two millennia, the Roman temples at Baalbek in eastern Lebanon have stood as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture anywhere in the world.",
      "On Wednesday, a car park just metres away from the Unesco World Heritage site was hit by an Israeli air strike.",
      "The attack, which also destroyed a centuries-old Ottoman building, highlighted what some archaeologists say is the risk of irreparable damage to historical sites across Lebanon from the current war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "\"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon. You couldn't replace it if someone bombed it,\" says Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham University.",
      "\"It would be a huge loss. It would be a crime.\"",
      "Since late September, Israel has pummelled Lebanon with thousands of air strikes in an escalation of its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group it has been fighting in nearly a year of cross-border strikes.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has largely been targeting southern Lebanon, suburbs in the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.",
      "But in the past fortnight, the campaign has moved into new areas, or rather, very old ground.",
      "The IDF told the BBC that it only targets military sites. But those targets are incredibly close to the Baalbek temples and Roman ruins in Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire around 2,500 years ago.",
      "According to legend, Tyre is the place where purple pigment was first created - the dye crushed out of snail shells to embroider royal robes.",
      "On 23 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods close to the city's Roman ruins, including the remains of a necropolis and a hippodrome.",
      "Hours later it began striking targets. More bombing of the sites was reported last week.",
      "Videos from the strikes showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from seafront areas only a few hundred metres from the ruins.",
      "There is no evidence that the Roman sites in Tyre and Baalbek have been damaged by the Israeli strikes. But Lebanese archaeologists are alarmed at how close the fighting has been to the millennia-old ruins, recognised by Unesco as having outstanding value to humanity.",
      "\"For Baalbek it was even worse than Tyre, because the temples are located within the area that is targeted and [the IDF] did not make any exemption for the temples,\" says local archaeologist Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly.",
      "She says there are no Hezbollah facilities at the Baalbek site: \"No one knows what the excuse or the message behind the hit is.\"",
      "The IDF disputes this. In a statement, it told the BBC it targets military sites in accordance with strict protocol, adding that it is \"aware of the existence of sensitive sites and this is taken into account and constitutes an essential part of the planning of strikes\".",
      "\"Each strike that poses a risk to a sensitive structure is weighed carefully and goes through a rigorous approval process as required.\"",
      "Some ordinary Lebanese attempting to escape Israeli bombing reportedly fled to the Baalbek ruins, judging that ancient sites would not be targeted by Israel and would therefore offer protection.",
      "Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says \"those who didn't have a car to flee\" moved closer to the ruins, in the belief that the Unesco sites are considered more valuable than their lives.",
      "It prompted the local government to issue a warning urging people against travelling to the ruins.",
      "\"They see the site as their shelter. But the site is not a shelter,\" Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says.",
      "The war puts Israel in a \"difficult situation\", says Israeli archaeologist Erez Ben-Yosef.",
      "He said that war damage to important archaeological sites would be a \"huge loss to the cultural heritage of Lebanon and indeed the entire world.",
      "\"However, I know personally that Israel is doing everything it can to prevent such damage.",
      "\"Many of my fellow archaeologists, both colleagues and students, serve in the army and participate in the war... they actively work to prevent such damage, in accordance with the general guidelines of our military.\"",
      "Graham Philip, the Durham University archaeology professor, says he doesn\u2019t believe Israel would intentionally hit Baalbek or other sites.",
      "\"It's hard to see what they would gain in a military sense, bombing a Roman temple.\"",
      "But he cautioned about the risk of some bombs or missiles going off target and hitting the ruins, even unintentionally: \"If you drop enough ordnance, not all of that lands within 25 metres of the target.\"",
      "Mr Philip has been closely monitoring the impact of Israel's strikes on heritage sites in Gaza where it is fighting Hamas, leading a British university team documenting archaeological destruction across the territory.",
      "He says it is still too early to assess how much damage has been done by the current wars in Lebanon and Gaza. But a Unesco survey published in September found that 69 cultural heritage sites in Gaza had been damaged by the war, which was triggered by the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.",
      "The oldest mosque in Gaza, the Great Omari Mosque, is one. It was built on the site of an ancient Philistine temple before being converted into a church and then a mosque. It was reportedly mostly destroyed by an Israeli strike in December 2023.",
      "Mr Philip says these ancient sites are not only important anchors to the classical past, but are \"almost like the soul of a population\".",
      "\"Imagine how people would feel in Britain if the Tower of London or Stonehenge were destroyed.",

      "Trump has said repeatedly he believes he has the right to voice his views on Fed actions. He told Bloomberg over the summer that he would let Powell serve out his term, which ends in 2026, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing\".",

      "The cut announced on Thursday, which was widely expected and unanimous, marked the second drop in a row, lowering rates by a further 0.25 percentage points.",

      "\"We don't think it's a good time to be doing a lot of further guidance - there's a fair amount of uncertainty,\" he said. \"The point is to find the right pace and destination as we go.\"",
      "Whitney Watson, co-chief investment officer of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said her firm expected to see another rate cut in December, but acknowledged questions about the path ahead.",
      "\"Stronger data and uncertainty over fiscal and trade policies mean rising risks that the Fed may opt to slow the pace of easing,\" she said, noting that the central bank might start to \"skip\" rate cuts next year.",

      "1) Deport undocumented migrants",
      "While campaigning, Trump promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history.",
      "He also pledged to complete the building of a wall at the border with Mexico that was started during his first presidency.",
      "The number of crossings at the US southern border hit record levels at the end of last year during the Biden-Harris administration, before falling in 2024.",
      "Experts have told the BBC that deportations on the scale promised by Trump would face huge legal and logistical challenges - and could slow economic growth.",
      "2) Moves on economy, tax and tariffs",
      "Exit poll data has suggested the economy was a key issue for voters. Trump has promised to \"end inflation\" - which rose to high levels under President Joe Biden before falling again. But a president's power to directly influence prices is limited.",
      "He has also promised sweeping tax cuts, extending his overhaul from 2017. He has proposed making tips tax-free, abolishing tax on social security payments and shaving corporation tax.",
      "He has proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said. Some economists have warned that such moves could push up prices for ordinary people.",
      "3) Cut climate regulations",
      "During his first presidency, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections and made America the first nation to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.",
      "This time, he has again vowed to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden's targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars.",
      "He has pledged to increase production of US fossil fuels - vowing to \"drill, drill, drill\" on day one in favour of renewable energy sources such as wind power.",

      "He has not said what he thinks either side should give up. Democrats say the move would embolden President Vladimir Putin.",

      "\"Losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard,\" Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in an email to staff on Wednesday. \"This will take a long time to process.\"",
      "As the sitting vice-president, Harris was unable to untether herself from an unpopular president and convince voters that she could offer the change they were seeking amid widespread economic anxiety.",
      "Biden's baggage",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance, Harris was anointed to the top of the ticket, bypassing the scrutiny of a primary without a single vote being cast.",
      "She began her 100-day campaign promising a \"new generation of leadership\", rallying women around abortion rights and vowing to win back working-class voters by focusing on economic issues including rising costs and housing affordability.",
      "With just three months until election day, she generated a wave of initial momentum, which included a flurry of memes on social media, a star-studded endorsement list that included Taylor Swift and a record-setting donation windfall. But Harris couldn't shake the anti-Biden sentiment that permeated much of the electorate.",
      "The president's approval rating has consistently hovered in the low 40s throughout his four years in office, while some two-thirds of voters say they believe the US is on the wrong track.",

      "Some allies have privately questioned whether Harris remained too loyal to Biden in her bid to replace him. But Jamal Simmons, the vice-president's former communication director, called it a \"trap\", arguing any distance would have only handed Republicans another attack line for being disloyal.",
      "\"You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,\" he said.",
      "Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail.",
      "But she then failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country, and how she would handle economic frustrations as well as widespread concerns over immigration.",
      "About 3 in 10 voters said their family's financial situation was falling behind, an increase from about 2 in 10 four years ago, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 US voters conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.",
      "Nine in 10 voters were very or somewhat concerned about the price of groceries.",
      "The same survey found that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020.",
      "And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on.",
      "Struggle to build on Biden's network of support",
      "The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters.",
      "But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends.",
      "Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was \"no great surprise\" that working class voters abandoned the party.",
      "\"First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" he said. \"And they're right.\"",
      "While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women.",
      "In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory.",
      "While some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for Harris, it fell short of the 57% who backed Biden in 2020, according to exit poll data.",
      "Making it about Trump backfired",
      "Even before she was catapulted to the top of the ticket, Harris had sought to frame the race as a referendum on Trump, not Biden.",
      "The former California prosecutor leaned into her law enforcement record to prosecute the case against the former president.",
      "But her nascent campaign opted to ditch Biden's core argument that Trump posed an existential threat to democracy, prioritising a forward-looking \"joyful\" message about protecting personal freedoms and preserving the middle class.",
      "In the final stretch, however, Harris made a tactical decision to again highlight the dangers of a second Trump presidency, calling the president a \"fascist\" and campaigning with disaffected Republicans fed up with his rhetoric.",
      "After Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told the New York Times that Trump spoke approvingly about Adolf Hitler, Harris delivered remarks outside her official residence describing the president as \"unhinged and unstable\".",
      "\"Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump,\" veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday night.",
      "\"Voters already know everything there is about Trump \u2013 but they still wanted to know more about Harris\u2019 plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration.\"",
      "\u201cIt was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris\u2019s own ideas,\u201d he added.",

      "This is surely the most dramatic comeback in US political history.",
      "Four years after leaving the White House, Donald Trump is set to move back in, after millions of Americans voted to give him a second chance.",
      "The election campaign was one for the history books: he survived two assassination attempts and his original opponent President Joe Biden dropped out just months before election day.",
      "Although final votes are still being counted, the majority of Americans in key battleground states chose to vote for him, with many citing the economy and immigration as a chief concern.",

      "Follow live election day updates as Trump wins",
      "His triumph comes after a spectacular fall. He refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden, and his role in trying to overturn the election results to stay in office is still being scrutinised today.",

      "Who did each state vote for?",
      "When does Donald Trump become US president again?",
      "What could happen to Trump's legal cases now",
      "He faces charges for allegedly inciting the violent attack on the US Capitol on the 6 January 2021. And he will also make history as the first sitting president to have been convicted of a felony, after being found guilty of falsifying business records.",
      "It\u2019s not hard to see why he is a deeply polarising figure.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Trump used incendiary rhetoric \u2013 making crass jokes and threatening vengeance against his political enemies.",
      "His message on the economy touched a chord",
      "Few people have a middle ground when it comes to Trump. Most of the voters I spoke to during the course of this campaign said they wished he would \u201cshut his potty mouth\u201d \u2013 but they were able to look past it.",
      "Instead, they focused on the question he asked at every rally. \u201cAre you better off now than you were two years ago?\u201d",
      "So many people who voted for Donald Trump told me again and again that they felt the economy was much better when he was in office and they were sick of trying to make ends meet. Although much of the cause of inflation was due to outside forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they blamed the outgoing administration.",
      "Voters were also deeply concerned about illegal immigration which had reached record levels under Biden. They usually didn\u2019t express racist views or believe that migrants were eating people\u2019s pets, as Trump and his supporters had claimed. They just wanted much stronger border enforcement.",
      "'America first' for a second Trump term",
      "\u201cAmerica first\u201d was another one of Trump\u2019s slogans that really seemed to strike a chord with voters. All over the country I heard people \u2013 on the left and right - complaining about billions of dollars being spent on supporting Ukraine when they thought that money would be much better spent at home.",
      "In the end, they just couldn\u2019t vote for Harris, who served as Biden\u2019s vice-president for four years. They believed it would be more of the same, and they wanted change.",

      "It is perhaps one of the ironies of this election that the candidate who most represented change was himself in power just four years ago. But there are several differences between then and now.",
      "When he first came into power in 2016, he was a political outsider, and, at least for a while, he surrounded himself with veteran political advisers and staff who showed him the ropes and constrained his actions. Now he doesn\u2019t seem that interested in playing by the rules of the game.",
      "Many of these same advisers and staff have spoken out \u2013 calling him a \u201cliar\u201d, a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d. They have cautioned that if he surrounds himself with loyalists, which he is expected to do, that there will be no one to restrain him from his more extreme ideas.",
      "When he left office, he faced a litany of criminal charges related to his role in the Capitol riots, how he handled documents pertaining to national security, and hush money payments to a porn star.",
      "But since the Supreme Court ruled that the president has total immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, it will be an uphill battle for any prosecutor to charge him during the next administration.",
      "And as president, he could instruct his justice department to drop the federal charges against him relating to the 6 January riots so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a jail sentence. At the same time, he could pardon hundreds of people sentenced to prison for their part in the Capitol Riots.",
      "In the end, voters were presented with two versions of America.",
      "Donald Trump told them that their country was a failing nation that only he could Make Great Again.",
      "Meanwhile, Harris cautioned that if Trump was elected, American democracy itself would face an existential threat. That remains to be seen. But what Trump said himself during the campaign has not exactly assuaged people\u2019s fears.",
      "He has heaped praise on authoritarian leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whom he said were \u201cat the top of their game, whether you like it or not\u201d.",
      "He has talked about trying to silence critics in the press. Just days before the election, he also made comments that implied he wouldn\u2019t mind if members of the media were killed.",
      "And he has continued to amplify conspiracy theories and unfounded claims of election fraud \u2013 even though the election ultimately led to his victory.",
      "Now, voters will find how much of what he said during the campaign was just loose talk - \u201cTrump being Trump\u201d. And remember: it\u2019s not just Americans who have to confront the reality of a second Trump term.",
      "The rest of the world will now discover what \u201cAmerica First\u201d really means. From the global economic consequences of 20% tariffs that he has proposed on US imports to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that he has vowed to end \u2013 regardless of which side wins.",
      "Donald Trump did not manage to implement all of his plans in his first term. Now with a second mandate and significantly less encumbered, America, and the world, will see what he can really do.",

    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",

      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",

      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:01:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The birth of a great Indian bustard chick through artificial insemination has given hope to conservationists.",
    "story": [
      "Last month brought good news for the great Indian bustard, a critically endangered bird found mainly in India.",
      "Wildlife officials in the western state of Rajasthan have performed the first successful hatching of a chick through artificial insemination.",
      "A lone adult male in one of two breeding centres in Jaisalmer city was trained to produce sperm without mating, which was then used to impregnate an adult female at the second centre some 200km (124 miles) away.",
      "Officials said the development was important as it has opened up the possibility of creating a sperm bank.",
      "Over the years, habitat loss, poaching and collisions with overhead power lines have effected great Indian bustards. Their numbers have fallen from more than 1,000 in the 1960s to around 150 at present.",
      "Most of them are found in Jaisalmer and hence, conservation activists say that the bird's habitat in the city should be protected. But this land is also prime real estate for renewable energy firms, presenting authorities with a unique conservation challenge.",
      "The great Indian bustard may not be as well known as the peacock (India's national bird) but it's just as impressive, says Sumit Dookia, a conservation ecologist who has been studying the bird for close to a decade. The massive bird, which weighs between 15kg and 18kg, is one of the biggest flying birds in India.",
      "It once had a prolific presence in the country and was found in at least 11 states, but today, its population is confined to Rajasthan, while a handful might be spotted in the southern state of Karnataka and the western state of Gujarat.",
      "The shy bird plays an important role in the food chain by preying on rodents, snakes and other pests and is also the state bird of Rajasthan, where it is called 'Godawan' by locals.",
      "But some of the bird's unique evolutionary traits are clashing with human interventions, making it vulnerable to extinction.",
      "For one, the great Indian bustard has good peripheral vision but poor frontal vision, making it difficult for them to spot power lines until they fly too close to them. Their large size makes it difficult for them to quickly change their flight path and they end up colliding with the cables and dying.",
      "\"Their vision could have developed like this as the bird spends a large amount of time on land,\" says Mr Dookia. It also lays its eggs on the ground, without a nest or any other form of protection except for the watchful eye of the mother and this might have caused it to develop good side vision, he adds.",
      "The great Indian bustard also has unique breeding habits. The bird lays just one egg at a time and spends the next two years caring for its offspring.",
      "\"Since it reaches maturity at around four years of age and lives for 12-15 years, it lays just about four-five eggs in its lifetime and many of these eggs are destroyed by predators,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "Conservationists say that over the past few years, the great Indian bustard's habitat in Jaisalmer has been overrun by solar and wind energy farms, leading to an increase in flying accidents.",
      "\"The increased human presence has also created more filth, attracting stray dogs who kill the birds or destroy their eggs,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "To boost the bird's population, the government of Rajasthan collaborated with the federal government and the Wildlife Institute of India to launch a conservation breeding centre at Sam city in 2018. Another breeding centre was set up at Ramdevra village in 2022, says Ashish Vyas, a top forest official in Jaisalmer.",
      "As a first step, researchers collected eggs found in the wild and hatched them in incubation centres. \"Currently, there are 45 birds in both the centres,14 of which are captive-bred chicks (including the one born through artificial insemination),\" he adds.",
      "The plan is to further boost the bird's population and then eventually release them into the wild. But conservationists say that this is easier said than done.",
      "This is because the birds born in these breeding centres have imprinted on human researchers (in other words, they have formed close bonds with their human caretakers) and have lost about 60-70% of their ability to survive in the wild, says Mr Dookia.",
      "\"Human imprinting is necessary for feeding and handling the birds but it also makes them lose their natural instincts. It will be extremely challenging to re-wild them, especially if there's no habitat left for the birds to be released into,\" he adds.",
      "The loss of habitat has also resulted in another problem: researchers have noticed that the birds, which used to migrate across states, have almost completely stopped doing so. Even in Jaisalmer, where the birds are found in two pockets - Pokhran in the eastern part of the city and the Desert National Park in the west - there's hardly any cross-migration, says Mr Dookia.",
      "It's likely that the birds have stopped migrating over large distances in response to flying accidents, he adds. This increases the risk of inbreeding, which could result in birth defects.",
      "\"Thus, the only solution to conserve the great Indian bustard is to preserve its natural habitat,\" he says.",
      "But a Supreme Court judgement from April has made conservationists uneasy.",
      "The court overturned an earlier interim order, which had instructed Rajasthan and Gujarat to prioritise moving power cables underground in great Indian bustard habitats. The order had created a furore among renewable energy firms, who said that this would cost them billions of rupees and virtually kill their business.",
      "In its latest judgment, the court observed that people had the right to be free from the harmful effects of climate change and that shifting large sections of power cables underground may not be feasible for firms from a monetary and technical standpoint.",
      "It also directed that a committee be set up to look into the feasibility of moving power lines and the efficacy of bird diverters - devices that have reflectors and are attached to power cables to alert birds about their presence.",
      "While corporates have hailed the top court's judgment, conservationists and some legal experts say that it's problematic as it pits one good cause against another.",
      "\"The judgment brings into focus a flawed understanding of the interplay between climate change, biodiversity and development issues,\" ecologist Debadityo Sinha wrote in a column.",
      "He noted that many highly-populated cities in India have underground power lines and that other states have taken such a step to protect other bird species in the past. He also pointed out that although moving power cables underground is expensive, it's likely to amount to a fraction of a firm's total earnings.",
      "Mr Dookia says that one of the reasons renewable energy companies are flocking to Rajasthan is because of the low cost of land.",
      "\"There's also not much research on how these renewable energy farms will impact the state's climate and ecology in the long run,\" he says.",
      "\"So it's not just the bird's future that hangs in the balance, it's also man's.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "The other two charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including cocaine, and have been charged with two acts each of supplying narcotics. Officials did not say what the sentence for those charges could be.",
      "One of the people charged with supplying narcotics is a hotel employee, the prosecutor's office said. The three people charged have been notified of the charges, the prosecutor's office said, and have been prohibited from leaving the country.",
      "None of the suspects were identified by name.",
      "The release also stated that Payne died from a fall, and had not jumped from the balcony. Officials had not previously confirmed which version of events had happened, but the prosecutor's office said that Payne was likely \"not fully conscious or was experiencing a state of noticeable decrease or loss of consciousness\" at the time of the fall.",
      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",

    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",

      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",
      "Wallace was fined $100,000, as was 23XI. The one-race suspensions went to team executive Dave Rogers, crew chief Robert Barker and spotter Freddie Kraft. The team also lost 50 points.",
      "Sawyer had said Sunday that NASCAR would review the Martinsville finish to see if there was indeed any race manipulation with rival drivers helping others that are aligned with the same manufacturer.",
      "But he said he hoped the penalties were harsh enough to curb the manufacturer alliances and race manipulation.",
      "\"We took and looked at the most recent penalty that we had written for an infraction very similar... we wanted to ramp this one up,\" Sawyer said, \"and we did. We did that in a way that included team leadership and this is something that we felt like we wanted to get our point across that it is a responsibility of all of us.... to uphold the integrity of the sport.\"",

      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",

    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

    "summary": "The former child actor who grew up to play Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child in \"Succession,\" is now playing a rudderless man-child in Jesse Eisenberg's poignant comedy, \"A Real Pain.\"",
    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",
      "Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin replied, \"I don't really know what it was with me, but I went, I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Describing the character, Culkin has said, \"I'm one quick little misstep away from being that person.\"",
      "\"That's good! I said that? Good!\" he laughed. \"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path. There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal.

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, but Trump's economic priorities could impact future policy.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut, half the size of its September reduction, lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election. In\u00a0exit polls\u00a0on Tuesday, many voters reported that they're still hurting from the sharpest inflation in 40 years and expressed dissatisfaction with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Inflation remains \"somewhat elevated\"",
      "Although inflation has since cooled and now hovers just above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate, prices remain high, while elevated borrowing costs have also hit people's pocketbooks.",
      "\"Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics predicted the Fed would drop its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its next three meetings, with the rate bottoming out in May between 3.50% and 3.75%.",
      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected. We expect the same to occur in December,\" Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "What the Fed rate cut means for mortgage interest rates",
      "What the Fed rate cut means for mortgage interest rates",
      "Watson added, \"However, stronger data and uncertainty over fiscal and trade policies mean rising risks that the Fed may opt to slow the pace of easing.\"",
      "Trump's proposed combination of tariffs, tax cuts, increased federal spending and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants could increase inflation by as much as\u00a01 percentage point, some economists project.",
      "If that occurs, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continue easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise interest rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "Powell demurred Thursday when asked by reporters whether the outcome of the election would affect Fed policy. By contrast, he bluntly said he wouldn't step down if Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign. Powell added that is against the law for a U.S. president to fire or demote the Fed chair.",

      "The Trump administration could be a boon for business for private prison companies in the U.S. if the president-elect delivers on his promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "CoreCivic and Geo Group, the two biggest private prison operators in the U.S., both contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detained, undocumented migrants. Their stocks soared Wednesday following Trump's election win, with investors betting the companies will see increased profits from a tough-on-immigration administration.",
      "CoreCivic, which closed at $13.50 a share on November 5, is trading at $22 a share, while Geo Group, which closed at $15 a share Tuesday, is currently trading at $23.75.",
      "\"Obviously, investors believe there is going to be a significant increase in opportunity for both of these firms under the Trump administration,\" Noble Capital Markets analyst Joe Gomes told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "CoreCivic executives also said they believe the election result will drive demand for its services.",
      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "When asked if he'd step down if Trump requested it, Powell responded with a one-word answer: \"No.\"",
      "Powell's insistence that he'll remain in his role comes after Trump aired grievances about the Fed's decision-making during his first presidency and, more recently, on the campaign trial. Trump, who has accused Powell of being \"political,\" also told Bloomberg Businessweek this summer he would let the economist serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",

      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",

The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",

      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday made its second rate cut of this year, with the decision coming less than two months after the central bank's surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed shaved borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to its Thursday\u00a0statement. That brings down the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "The Fed's 0.25 percentage point cut will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "At a Thursday press conference to discuss the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that Americans \"are still feeling the effects of high prices\" despite the slowdown in inflation.",
      "\"I think what needs to happen is happening, but it'll be some time before people regain their confidence,\" he added. \"We don't tell people how to feel about the economy \u2014 we completely respect what they are feeling.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed\u00a0announced its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7. That was followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How will the election impact the Fed's decision?",
      "The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former\u00a0President Donald Trump to victory.",
      "Although Fed chief Powell was asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, he shied away from commenting about the election. He also added that the election won't have a near-term impact on the Fed's decisions, with the central bank instead relying on economic data.",
      "\"We don't know what the timing or substance of any policy changes will be,\" Powell said. \"We don't guess, we don't speculate and we don't assume.\"",
      "Powell has long stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics.",
      "Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate.",
      "If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",

      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time.

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:36:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",

      "By comparison, majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400. The speaker of the House receives $223,500 annually.",
      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",
      "How rich is the typical senator?",
      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",
      "Most senators built their fortunes before becoming members of Congress, according to Investopedia. A 2019 financial disclosure showed that half of the members of Congress were millionaires, according to\u00a0Open Secrets. Senators are required by Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to disclose their financial assets each year.",

      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "Representatives for the White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",
      "The Biden administration's program would allow eligible immigrants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country by granting them an immigration benefit known as parole, which effectively cancels out their illegal entry.",
      "In his ruling, Campbell Barker said the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to grant parole to unauthorized immigrants who are already in the U.S.",

      "\"Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.\"",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on camera. Trump asked her to come to the microphone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, but she declined, preferring to stay out of the spotlight.",
      "Wiles has managed to not just curry but, more critically, keep Trump's favor while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for DJT and a great boss,\" one Trump adviser said. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",

      "\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\" President Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"",
      "He urged Americans to embrace unity, and said he accepted the results of the election.",
      "\"We accept the choice the country made,\" he said. \"I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree,\" and he called for unity after the bitterly partisan election.",

      "\"For over 200 years, America has carried on the greatest experiment in self-government in the history of the world,\" the president said in an address in the White House Rose Garden, continuing, \"where the people, the people vote and choose their own leaders and they do it peacefully. And where in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails.\"",
      "The president also praised Harris' campaign during his brief remarks, which lasted about six minutes.",
      "\"She ran an inspiring campaign, and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much \u2014 her character,\" Mr Biden said. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod, she has great character, true character. She gave her whole heart and effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.\"",
      "It was only four months ago that Mr. Biden was seeking reelection himself, before exiting the race and passing the baton to Harris. Now, he'll be handing off to Trump.",
      "The president also said he hopes this election quiets doubts about the integrity of the election and election workers, a reference to misinformation spread by Trump and Republicans about the 2020 election.",
      "\"I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system \u2014 it is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And it can be trusted, win or lose.\"",
      "Mr. Biden spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris over the phone on Wednesday to congratulate her on her campaign, despite the loss. In a statement Wednesday he said when he backed her to become the nominee that selecting Harris as his running mate was \"the best decision I made.\"",
      "In his conversation with Trump, the president said he also invited the president-elect to a meeting at the White House. The Trump campaign said the former president \"looks forward to the meeting\" and that Trump \"very much appreciated the call.\"",
      "Throughout the campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly framed a possible Trump return to the White House as a threat to democracy, and the two men have been bitter rivals since they faced off in the 2020 presidential election. After Mr. Biden's victory, Trump stalled the transition of power as he refused to accept the results of the election.",
      "Harris formally conceded the race Wednesday afternoon in a speech delivered from her alma mater, Howard University, where she stressed that the results of the election must be accepted while reiterating her commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, but Trump's economic priorities could impact future policy.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut, half the size of its September reduction, lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election. In\u00a0exit polls\u00a0on Tuesday, many voters reported that they're still hurting from the sharpest inflation in 40 years and expressed dissatisfaction with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Inflation remains \"somewhat elevated\"",
      "Although inflation has since cooled and now hovers just above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate, prices remain high, while elevated borrowing costs have also hit people's pocketbooks.",
      "\"Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics predicted the Fed would drop its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its next three meetings, with the rate bottoming out in May between 3.50% and 3.75%.",
      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected.

      "If that occurs, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continue easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise interest rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "Powell demurred Thursday when asked by reporters whether the outcome of the election would affect Fed policy. By contrast, he bluntly said he wouldn't step down if Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign.

He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person named on a list of people who have knowledge of Giuliani's assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",
      "\"My expectation is you're going to answer that question truthfully and fully,\" Liman said, adding that someone else \"in the world\" must have knowledge of Giuliani's various assets.",
      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani had not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",
      "\"That's the one piece of property sitting here in Manhattan that can't be moved. Everything else has been game playing,\" said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss.",
      "\"We've asked over and over where this stuff is, and the defendant has refused to answer,\" Nathan said.",

      "Liman warned Caruso to \"consider your words\" about access to the storage facility, because it could end up the subject of a contempt hearing if Giuliani doesn't turn over the property he owes.",
      "A jury in December 2023 awarded the pair $148 million in damages for lies Giuliani spread about them after the 2020 presidential election. The massive award sent Giuliani into bankruptcy, and entitled the defamed women to much of what he owns.",
      "Asked by a reporter after Thursday's hearing if he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani exclaimed, \"No!\" He then denied defaming them.",
      "Liman had given Giuliani until Oct. 29 to surrender a long list of possessions, including the Mercedes, two dozen high-end watches, a jersey signed by New York Yankees Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio \u2014 long featured prominently above the fireplace in Giuliani's $5 million apartment \u2014 as well as other furniture and sports memorabilia. The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",
      "In court on Thursday, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Giuliani, said he believed the half century old car could be appraised as being worth less than $4,000. He noted that a court order allows him to keep a vehicle to that value.",
      "Caruso had asked Liman to allow Giuliani to attend the hearing remotely, as he had previously. Caruso said Giuliani is under contract to do evening radio appearances on Thursdays and Fridays. Caruso said Giuliani uses \"broadcasting equipment\" in his Florida home.",
      "Liman rejected that request. On Thursday, he gave lawyers for the women until Nov. 11 to instruct Giuliani on how to turn over his property, and Giuliani four days after to comply.",

      "After President-elect Donald Trump's victory against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election was driven in part by young male voters, some are calling for the use of South Korea's \"4B Movement\" in the United States.",
      "The presidential election was seen by many as a referendum on women's rights. Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",
      "Now, some women are swearing to abide by the code of the \"4B movement,\" a South Korean feminist approach that swears off men. Here's what to know about the 4B movement.",
      "What is the 4B movement?",
      "In short, the 4B movement is a vow to swear off men. It is called the 4B movement because in Korean, the four tenets each begin with bi, which means no, according to a paper published by two South Korean researchers at Yonsei University's Institute of Humanities.",
      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. The movement is also known as the \"4 Nos.\"",
      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",
      "The 4B movement in the United States",
      "After Trump's election victory on Tuesday, women on social media have expressed interest in following the \"4 Nos\" of the movement. Trump made strong inroads with young men under 30, according to exit polls from CBS News.",
      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X. Similar posts have percolated across social media.",
      "In response, women have called for an American version of the 4B movement. Use of the phrase on social media and in searches has skyrocketed. Some have also referenced \"Lysistrata,\" a Greek comedy where women take part in a sex strike to convince the men in their lives to end a war.",

    "summary": "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits after President-elect Donald Trump won the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's\u00a0defeated\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and although he ran for president three times, this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The Constitution rules that even if the terms aren't consecutive, a person can only hold the office of the president twice.",
      "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits.",
      "How many terms can someone serve as president?",
      "A person can serve two four-year terms as president, as outlined in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. The terms do not have to be consecutive.",
      "A vice president who serves as president can run for two terms after that service if they held the office of president for less than two years. So if a vice president took the office of president one year into a term, they could only run for office one more time. If they took power in the back half of the term, they could be elected to the presidency twice. In recent history, President Lyndon Johnson took over in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was killed, making him eligible to run in 1964 and 1968. He ultimately opted not to run in 1968, although he was in the race until after the New Hampshire primary.",
      "The two terms don't need to be consecutive: Until Trump's victory this week, Grover Cleveland was the only president to serve non-consecutive presidential terms.",
      "But this means that Donald Trump, who was elected to office in 2016 and in 2024, cannot be elected president again in 2028.",
      "Has anyone been president for more than two terms?",
      "Only one person has served more than two terms as president: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the longest-sitting president in United States history, serving from 1933 to 1945.",
      "That third term led to controversy, according to the National Constitution Center. The nation's first president, George Washington, had established a precedent of only two terms in office per president, and some saw Roosevelt's break from tradition as a threat to democracy.",
      "In 1947, Congress approved the 22nd amendment. The amendment was ratified in February 1951.",
      "How many times can someone run for president?",
      "There's no limit to how many times someone can run for president.",
      "There have been more than a few perennial candidates for president throughout American history. Harold Stassen, a former governor of Minnesota, ran for president as a Republican candidate nine times between 1944 and 1992. Lyndon LaRouche ran for president in eight consecutive elections between 1976 and 2004 \u2014 once as the candidate for the U.S. Labor Party, which he had founded, and seven times as a candidate for the Democratic party.",
      "What Trump has said about term limits",
      "Trump has made a number of comments about term limits and his time in office, although it's unclear if he was serious. In July, he repeatedly told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn't \"have to vote anymore\" if he was elected to office in 2024. Some saw the comments as a threat to not leave office after a second term.",
      "\"Christians, get out in vote. Just this time,\" he said during a speech at the Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\"",
      "Trump continued: \"I love you Christians and I'm a Christian. I love you, you got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.\"",
      "Trump has mentioned the idea of a third term more than once. In August 2020, he said he would win that election and then \"go another four years\" because \"they spied on my campaign,\" according to Forbes. A month later, he told crowds he would \"negotiate\" more time in office, saying that he was \"probably entitled to another four after (2020)\" based on \"the way we were treated.\"",
      "In April 2024, Trump told Time magazine that he intends \"to serve four years and do a great job\" and \"wouldn't be in favor\" of an extended term, but during a 2024 speech for the National Rifle Association, Trump asked supporters if he would be considered \"three-term or two-term.\"",
      "Since losing the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly falsely claimed that he had won.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the ongoing federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Regulations governing the special counsel dictate that the upper echelons of the Justice Department, including possibly Attorney General Merrick Garland, are to be consulted on major decisions in an investigation overseen by a special counsel. Smith's office declined to comment.",
      "Garland appointed Smith in November 2022 to take over the Justice Department's investigations involving Trump.",

      "The former president pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically motivated prosecution aimed at assisting President Biden's \u2014 and then Harris' \u2014 campaign against him.",
      "In the prosecution involving government documents, which was brought in South Florida, Smith and his team claimed Trump unlawfully held onto dozens of records bearing classification markings after leaving the White House in January 2021 and worked with two staffers, who were charged alongside him, to impede the Justice Department's investigation. The staffers, aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty.",
      "The former president faced 40 charges, but they were all dismissed earlier this year when the judge overseeing the case, Aileen Cannon, ruled Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Smith appealed the ruling, and both sides have submitted filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on the issue.",
      "In the second case, brought in Washington, D.C., prosecutors claimed Trump mounted an illegal scheme to hold onto power for a second term after losing the 2020 election to Mr. Biden. Proceedings were paused for months, though, as Trump sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",
      "The Cargo Dragon is expected to remain docked at the space station for about a month before it returns to Earth with station components needing refurbishment, trash and other no-longer-needed items.",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration program that would allow unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens to get legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. citizenship, declaring the policy illegal.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker, an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump, found the program violates U.S. immigration law, agreeing with a lawsuit filed by Texas and more than a dozen other Republican-led states.",
      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "Representatives for the White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",
      "The Biden administration's program would allow eligible immigrants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country by granting them an immigration benefit known as parole, which effectively cancels out their illegal entry.",

I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.\"",

      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election. In\u00a0exit polls\u00a0on Tuesday, many voters reported that they're still hurting from the sharpest inflation in 40 years and expressed dissatisfaction with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Inflation remains \"somewhat elevated\"",
      "Although inflation has since cooled and now hovers just above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate, prices remain high, while elevated borrowing costs have also hit people's pocketbooks.",
      "\"Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics predicted the Fed would drop its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its next three meetings, with the rate bottoming out in May between 3.50% and 3.75%.",
      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected. We expect the same to occur in December,\" Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email.",

      "What the Fed rate cut means for mortgage interest rates",
      "Watson added, \"However, stronger data and uncertainty over fiscal and trade policies mean rising risks that the Fed may opt to slow the pace of easing.\"",
      "Trump's proposed combination of tariffs, tax cuts, increased federal spending and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants could increase inflation by as much as\u00a01 percentage point, some economists project.",
      "If that occurs, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continue easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise interest rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "Powell demurred Thursday when asked by reporters whether the outcome of the election would affect Fed policy. By contrast, he bluntly said he wouldn't step down if Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign.

      "CoreCivic and Geo Group, the two biggest private prison operators in the U.S., both contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detained, undocumented migrants. Their stocks soared Wednesday following Trump's election win, with investors betting the companies will see increased profits from a tough-on-immigration administration.",

      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",

      "Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got a tongue-lashing Thursday in federal court after missing a deadline to turn over valuables to two election workers he defamed, including one asset, a vintage Mercedes, that he took for a drive to vote in Florida. He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person named on a list of people who have knowledge of Giuliani's assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",
      "\"My expectation is you're going to answer that question truthfully and fully,\" Liman said, adding that someone else \"in the world\" must have knowledge of Giuliani's various assets.",
      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani had not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",
      "\"That's the one piece of property sitting here in Manhattan that can't be moved. Everything else has been game playing,\" said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss.",
      "\"We've asked over and over where this stuff is, and the defendant has refused to answer,\" Nathan said.",
      "Kenneth Caruso, one of Giuliani's lawyers, said some of the items are now in a storage facility in suburban Ronkonkoma, New York, and claimed Giuliani has \"no control\" of it.",
      "Liman warned Caruso to \"consider your words\" about access to the storage facility, because it could end up the subject of a contempt hearing if Giuliani doesn't turn over the property he owes.",
      "A jury in December 2023 awarded the pair $148 million in damages for lies Giuliani spread about them after the 2020 presidential election. The massive award sent Giuliani into bankruptcy, and entitled the defamed women to much of what he owns.",
      "Asked by a reporter after Thursday's hearing if he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani exclaimed, \"No!\" He then denied defaming them.",
      "Liman had given Giuliani until Oct. 29 to surrender a long list of possessions, including the Mercedes, two dozen high-end watches, a jersey signed by New York Yankees Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio \u2014 long featured prominently above the fireplace in Giuliani's $5 million apartment \u2014 as well as other furniture and sports memorabilia. The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",
      "In court on Thursday, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Giuliani, said he believed the half century old car could be appraised as being worth less than $4,000. He noted that a court order allows him to keep a vehicle to that value.",
      "Caruso had asked Liman to allow Giuliani to attend the hearing remotely, as he had previously. Caruso said Giuliani is under contract to do evening radio appearances on Thursdays and Fridays. Caruso said Giuliani uses \"broadcasting equipment\" in his Florida home.",
      "Liman rejected that request. On Thursday, he gave lawyers for the women until Nov. 11 to instruct Giuliani on how to turn over his property, and Giuliani four days after to comply.",

      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

    "summary": "The FDA says oral phenylephrine, used in many over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, \"is not effective as a nasal decongestant.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",
      "\"PE should remain an available option for consumers, because Americans deserve the option to choose the safe and effective OTC medicines they prefer and rely on,\" Scott Melville, CHPA's president and CEO, said in a statement.",

      "Spokespeople for drugmakers behind the brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",
      "\"Let me be clear, oral phenylephrine is not a safety risk,\" Hatton, a professor at the University of Florida, told CBS News last year. \"It just doesn't work.\"",
      "In a scientific review published this week by the FDA, the agency's scientists concluded that past studies estimating that higher percentages of the drug could be absorbed during digestion were \"an overestimate and based on outdated technology.\"",
      "Less than 1% of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream after being swallowed, they estimated. Far higher doses could \"be needed to achieve a clinically meaningful outcome which would raise significant questions about safety.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's\u00a0defeated\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and although he ran for president three times, this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The Constitution rules that even if the terms aren't consecutive, a person can only hold the office of the president twice.",
      "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits.",
      "How many terms can someone serve as president?",
      "A person can serve two four-year terms as president, as outlined in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. The terms do not have to be consecutive.",
      "A vice president who serves as president can run for two terms after that service if they held the office of president for less than two years. So if a vice president took the office of president one year into a term, they could only run for office one more time. If they took power in the back half of the term, they could be elected to the presidency twice. In recent history, President Lyndon Johnson took over in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was killed, making him eligible to run in 1964 and 1968. He ultimately opted not to run in 1968, although he was in the race until after the New Hampshire primary.",

      "Has anyone been president for more than two terms?",
      "Only one person has served more than two terms as president: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the longest-sitting president in United States history, serving from 1933 to 1945.",
      "That third term led to controversy, according to the National Constitution Center. The nation's first president, George Washington, had established a precedent of only two terms in office per president, and some saw Roosevelt's break from tradition as a threat to democracy.",

      "How many times can someone run for president?",
      "There's no limit to how many times someone can run for president.",
      "There have been more than a few perennial candidates for president throughout American history. Harold Stassen, a former governor of Minnesota, ran for president as a Republican candidate nine times between 1944 and 1992. Lyndon LaRouche ran for president in eight consecutive elections between 1976 and 2004 \u2014 once as the candidate for the U.S. Labor Party, which he had founded, and seven times as a candidate for the Democratic party.",

      "Trump has made a number of comments about term limits and his time in office, although it's unclear if he was serious. In July, he repeatedly told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn't \"have to vote anymore\" if he was elected to office in 2024. Some saw the comments as a threat to not leave office after a second term.",
      "\"Christians, get out in vote. Just this time,\" he said during a speech at the Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\"",

      "Trump has mentioned the idea of a third term more than once. In August 2020, he said he would win that election and then \"go another four years\" because \"they spied on my campaign,\" according to Forbes. A month later, he told crowds he would \"negotiate\" more time in office, saying that he was \"probably entitled to another four after (2020)\" based on \"the way we were treated.\"",
      "In April 2024, Trump told Time magazine that he intends \"to serve four years and do a great job\" and \"wouldn't be in favor\" of an extended term, but during a 2024 speech for the National Rifle Association, Trump asked supporters if he would be considered \"three-term or two-term.\"",

While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

      "After President-elect Donald Trump's victory against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election was driven in part by young male voters, some are calling for the use of South Korea's \"4B Movement\" in the United States.",
      "The presidential election was seen by many as a referendum on women's rights. Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",
      "Now, some women are swearing to abide by the code of the \"4B movement,\" a South Korean feminist approach that swears off men. Here's what to know about the 4B movement.",
      "What is the 4B movement?",
      "In short, the 4B movement is a vow to swear off men. It is called the 4B movement because in Korean, the four tenets each begin with bi, which means no, according to a paper published by two South Korean researchers at Yonsei University's Institute of Humanities.",
      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. The movement is also known as the \"4 Nos.\"",
      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",
      "The 4B movement in the United States",
      "After Trump's election victory on Tuesday, women on social media have expressed interest in following the \"4 Nos\" of the movement. Trump made strong inroads with young men under 30, according to exit polls from CBS News.",
      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X. Similar posts have percolated across social media.",
      "In response, women have called for an American version of the 4B movement. Use of the phrase on social media and in searches has skyrocketed. Some have also referenced \"Lysistrata,\" a Greek comedy where women take part in a sex strike to convince the men in their lives to end a war.",

      "Berlin\u00a0\u2014   German authorities have detained a U.S. citizen on suspicion of attempting to pass sensitive information about American military operations in Germany to Chinese intelligence agencies. The suspect has been identified only as Martin D., under German privacy laws. He is a 37-year-old former civilian contractor employed by the U.S. military who was arrested by the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) Thursday morning in Frankfurt, according to the Federal Prosecutor's Office.",
      "The case is being investigated by the federal prosecutor's office, which ordered the arrest on a warrant issued on Oct. 30 by a federal judge.",
      "\"Due to a pressing suspicion, the accused stands charged with offering himself as an agent to a foreign intelligence service,\" the prosecutor's office said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Martin D. is accused of contacting Chinese government authorities earlier this year, offering to share confidential information he acquired during his work with the U.S. military in Germany. His former employment involved working as a civilian contractor for a private firm that provided services to American forces based in the central state of Hessen, where Frankfurt is located.",
      "Investigators believe Martin D. initiated contact with Chinese intelligence operatives, proposing to hand over classified information about the U.S. military presence and operations within Germany. The prosecutor's statement said he was \"urgently suspected of having expressed a willingness to conduct intelligence activities for a foreign intelligence service.\"",
      "In response to a potential national security threat, German counter-intelligence launched an investigation, with the BKA leading the operation. Martin D.'s residence was searched as part of the operation but authorities have not said what, if any, materials were seized.",
      "The investigation was launched based on initial information gathered by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which has been increasing vigilance against foreign intelligence activities within the country.",
      "The arrest comes amid growing concern in Western capitals about espionage and sabotage activities by foreign powers, particularly China and Russia. Just days ago, a source familiar with the matter  that American and European law enforcement agencies were jointly investigating whether incendiary devices that detonated in July at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the U.K. were part of a larger operation directed by Russia's military intelligence agency.",
      "Martin D. was scheduled to be brought before a judge at the German Federal Court of Justice Thursday. The judge was to formally present the arrest warrant and decide whether the accused can be held in pre-trial detention.",
      "Several people have been arrested in Germany this year and accused of spying for China. In April, federal prosecutors detained three Germans in D\u00fcsseldorf and Bad Homburg who have been accused of passing military technology information. Another high-profile case involved the arrest of a former assistant to far-right AfD party politician Maximilian Krah, who's accused of sharing EU Parliament data and surveilling Chinese dissidents in Germany.",
      "In early October, a Chinese woman working for a logistics company at Leipzig/Halle Airport was also detained on suspicion of espionage. She is accused of providing the former Krah associate with information about flights, cargo and passengers, particularly regarding military goods and individuals linked to a German defense firm.",

      "The bodies were found late Wednesday after police received a tip about an abandoned pickup truck on the main thoroughfare of the city of Chilpancingo, the state capital, prosecutors said in a news release. The city of 300,000 has been the scene of gruesome drug gang violence as two rival cartels fight for control of the area.",

The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \"no bullets\" part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country's 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren't harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \"hugs, not bullets\" slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, L\u00f3pez Obrador. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Environmental officials in Australia still haven't completely solved the mystery of black balls found littering popular beaches on the country's eastern coastline, but they're getting closer. The New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority said Wednesday that the composition of the mysterious globs had been determined \u2014 and it's not pretty \u2014 but their origin remains unclear.",
      "The golf-to-baseball sized balls \u2014 the appearance of hundreds of which forced the closure of two beaches near Sydney last month \u2014 are not, the agency said, tar balls as initially suspected. Or at least not simple tar balls from oil out at sea.",
      "They're more likely to be sewage-trash balls.",
      "According to the EPA's analysis, \"the balls comprised fatty acids, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other organic and inorganic materials.\" In plain English, that means a mix of cooking oils and fats, cleaning and skincare products, hair, food waste, oil and gas and any number of other things that people routinely flush, dump or wash down drains and storm grates.",
      "\"The investigation has revealed that the balls contain hundreds to thousands of different materials, including human hair and various fibres, indicating they likely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\" the agency concluded.",
      "But officials still couldn't say where the mix of materials came from.",
      "The EPA said it looked at \"several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\" but that due to \"the complex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water, testing has not been able to confirm their exact origin.\"",
      "It said the regional water company, Sydney Water, reported \"no issues with the operation or maintenance\" at two nearby treatment facilities when asked soon after the balls appeared. A review of data by the state maritime meteorological agency yielded \"nothing conclusive\" about where they might have washed up from.",
      "While the EPA said it was waiting for the final results of its tests on the mystery balls, the agency has separately been pushing for greater efforts to clean up the Sydney area, which it warned was quickly filling up with residents' trash.",
      "\"Greater Sydney is on the brink of a waste crisis, with landfill space expected to run out by 2030 unless urgent action is taken,\" the EPA said in a Nov. 1 social media post, heralding a Circular Economy Summit of government, industrial and environmental officials \"to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the NSW waste sector.\"",
      "Officials explained that the concept of a circular economy is one that \"keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and reduces the need for new materials,\" to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills \u2014 waste that, if it overwhelms the available landfill space, could be washed into water ways and then carried into the ocean.",
      "The black balls first started showing up on the Coogee and Gordon's Bay beaches near Sydney in mid-October, the local mayor said at the time, suggesting they could be tar balls, which often form at sea after an oil spill or leak.",

      "Climate scientists working at the European Union's\u00a0Copernicus Climate Change Service\u00a0have announced that 2024 is \"virtually certain\" to be the warmest year on record.",
      "According to its ERA5 dataset, the agency said it was \"virtually certain\" that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, and it will likely be more than 1.55 C above.",
      "For decades, scientists have warned that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.",
      "The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0unprecedented flooding and hurricane events. The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a01.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement.",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is 0.71 C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.16 C warmer than the same period in 2023.",
      "\"The average temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 to not be the warmest year,\" the agency said.",
      "The agency added that given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to its ERA5 model, it was also likely that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above.",
      "European temperatures were above average over almost all of the continent, Copernicus found. Outside Europe, temperatures were most above average over northern Canada, and well-above average over the central and western United States, northern Tibet, Japan and Australia.",
      "The agency also said Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest monthly extent for October, at 19% below average. Sea ice extent is a measure of the surface area of the ocean which is covered by ice.",
      "Sea ice concentration anomalies were well below average in all peripheral seas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of Svalbard, the agency said.",
      "Antarctic sea ice extent was 8% below average in October, which was the second-lowest such average behind only October 2023, when it was 11% below average, Copernicus said. Those numbers continued \"a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.\"",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is funded by the EU, routinely publishes monthly climate bulletins reporting on changes observed in global surface air and sea temperatures, sea ice cover and hydrological variables. All the reported findings are based on computer-generated analyses and the ERA5 dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.",
      "In a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month, the United Nations warned that the world is now in \"climate crunch time\" as greenhouse gases \u2014 which trap heat in the atmosphere that warms global temperatures and fuels more extreme weather events \u2014 have hit \"unprecedented levels.\"",
      "\"The numbers paint a clear picture,\" the U.N. said. \"To keep emissions below the\u00a0critical 1.5-degree target\u00a0set in Paris in 2015, countries must cut emissions by 42 percent overall by 2030 and achieve a 57 percent reduction by 2035.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a defense official confirmed to CBS News Thursday.",
      "The New York Times and Associated Press were first to report the news.",
      "The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them.",
      "Outcry over plea deal for 9/11 defendants",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",

      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site.",
      "However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the authority to toss out the plea deals.",

The hurricane made landfall at 4:15 p.m. with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Millions of Cubans were without power in October, which prompted the government to implement emergency measures to slash demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Cubans without power resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators as they waited for the power to go back on.",
      "The outage was the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. Various power installations in the country were damaged by Hurricane Ian leaving some homes without electricity for up to eight hours a day. The October blackout was considered to be Cuba's worst outage in two years and power authorities took days to restore power for about 2 million people.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to \"reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael,\" before the storm grew into a hurricane.",

      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

The storm had weakened somewhat since making landfall Wednesday, and by Thursday it had changed directions over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and was moving away from Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "The exact magnitude of Rafael's\u00a0impact on Cuba remained unclear Thursday afternoon. Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz reported \"major damages\" in Havana and two provinces in the surrounding region, but he did not provide details about the damages. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel separately said the government had not confirmed any deaths linked to Rafael.",

Cuba could continue to see rainfall linked to the storm, they warned, with additional rain of 2 to 4 inches likely for western parts of the island. If that happens, the total accumulation linked to Rafael could amount to a foot of rain in some areas.",

      "In October, the island was hit by a one-two punch. First, Cuba was roiled by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island's energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by another powerful hurricane that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island.",
      "It stoked discontent already simmering in Cuba amid an ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed many to migrate from Cuba.",
      "While the State Department issued a travel warning for Cuba because of the storm, the Cuban government also raised an alarm, asking citizens to hunker down.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 04:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "From enthusiasm from Israel's leader to thinly veiled anxiety from some of America's oldest European allies, foreign reaction to Trump's election victory is rolling in fast.",
    "story": [
      "With former President Donald Trump set to reprise his role as the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military and largest economy as he claims victory in the\u00a0U.S. presidential election, leaders around the world started reacting Wednesday to the reality of a second term in the White House for the businessman-turned-politician.",
      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and governments around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Later Wednesday Netanyahu's spokesperson said the Israeli prime minister had been among the first foreign leaders to call Trump and offer his congratulations personally.",
      "\"The conversation was warm and cordial,\" Netanyahu's office said, adding that the two men had \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election. Tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year, with President Biden and others criticising Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "The Biden administration has continued pushing for cease-fires on both fronts, to no avail, and demanding that Israel do more to mitigate the devastating impact of the wars on civilians.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",
      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy has warned that if the resolve of Ukraine's Western backers crumbles and Russia is allowed to seize Ukrainian territory, the war his country is fighting could spread, with direct implications for Americans.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" he told CBS News early this year.",
      "Hungary's President Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",
      "In a message posted on social media, Orb\u00e1n said Trump had pulled off \"the biggest comeback in US political history,\" and he congratulated him on his \"enormous win.\"",
      "Orban has made himself an outsider among European Union leaders by endorsing anti-immigrant policies and maintaining close ties with President Vladimir Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 all while touting his close ties to Trump.",
      "In a speech over the summer, Orb\u00e1n suggested he had even helped to craft Trump's future statecraft, claiming to have \"entered the policy-writing system of President Donald Trump's team,\" with \"deep involvement there.\"",
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump on Thursday for his presidential win, roughly 36 hours after the results were announced.",
      "Following a speech at an international forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin praised the president-elect for his bravery during the July assassination attempt. \"His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man,\" the Associated Press reported Putin said. He also said Trump's desire to restore relations with Russia and to help end the Ukrainian crisis, \"in my opinion, deserves attention at least.\"",
      "Putin never spoke publicly in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process.\u00a0Trump has previously lauded\u00a0Putin's leadership.",
      "Leonid Slutsky, who heads the Committee on International Affairs in Russia's State Duma, or parliament, was quoted Wednesday by the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying a Trump victory offered \"a chance for a more constructive approach to the Ukrainian conflict.\"",
      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",
      "China's President Xi Jinping and the Foreign Ministry",
      "\"We will continue to view and handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and cooperation for win-win,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday. \"We respect the choice of the American people and congratulate Mr. Trump on his election as president.\"",
      "President Xi Jinping spoke Thursday, congratulating Trump on his victory and calling for both nations to find the \"right way to get along\" and reiterating previous statements about the international community expecting the two major powers to \"respect each other (and) co-exist peacefully.\"",
      "The Chinese leader called for ongoing and increasing bilateral dialogue to manage the two countries differences.",
      "Trump has often described China as a primary U.S. adversary, and he's has pledged to continue a tit-for-tat tariff feud with the vast Asian nation.",
      "Under President Biden, the U.S. tightened export controls to try to\u00a0keep some sensitive U.S. technology out of China, and tension between Washington and Beijing had increased for years over China's stance on Taiwan, the democratically ruled island off its east coast that Xi has vowed to bring back under the control of the Chinese government for the first time in about 70 years.",
      "The U.S. is bound by American law to defend Taiwan from any military aggression, but Trump has never committed to doing so in the case of a Chinese invasion.",
      "The bilateral tension has decreased slightly since last year, with lines of communication between Washington and Beijing reopening, but it's unclear how hard Trump will actually push Beijing during his second term \u2014 after recent vows to \"tariff the hell out of that country\" \u2014 and how much that economic war could impact security matters.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US\u00a0partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",
      "\"I know that the US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,\" added Starmer.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,\" France's President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief statement posted on social media Wednesday. He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context. By cooperating with the United States of America and defending our interests and our values.\"",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte",
      "\"I just congratulated @realDonaldTrump on his election as President of the United States,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday, adding in his social media post that Trump's \"leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",
      "Trump and Erdogan appeared to get along relatively well during the American's first term in office.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva",
      "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known widely simply as Lula, offered his congratulations to Trump Wednesday \"on his election victory and return to the presidency of the United States.\"",
      "\"Democracy is the voice of the people and must always be respected,\" said the Brazilian leader, who is currently serving a third term after returning to office last year in an election that saw him defeat far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who was often compared to Trump.",
      "\"The world needs dialogue and joint work to achieve greater peace, development and prosperity. I wish the new government luck and success,\" da Silva said in his tweet.",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban regime",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, who stormed back into power after 20 years of U.S.-backed governance a year after the first Trump administration signed a peace agreement with the group in 2020, said Wednesday that it hoped for more cordial relations with Washington with his return to the White House.",
      "In a statement, the Taliban's foreign ministry voiced hope that \"the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.\"",
      "The Taliban, whose rule over Afghanistan has not been formally recognized by the U.S. or most other nations, noted Trump's role in getting the 2020 Doha Agreement peace deal and said \"it is expected that Mr. Trump will assume a constructive role in ending the current conflicts in the region & globally, particularly the ongoing brutality & aggression in Gaza & Lebanon.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region.",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival. Netanyahu cited \"significant gaps\" and a \"crisis of trust\" between the men in his Tuesday evening announcement.",
      "\"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,\" Netanyahu said. \"Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.\"",
      "In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for a diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group.",
      "Gallant, a former general who has gained public respect with a gruff, no-nonsense personality, said in a statement: \"The security of the state of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life's mission.\"",

An American company is working to change that, and their innovation is a contender for this year's annual Earthshot Prize, an award handed out by Britain's Prince William to highlight solutions to the climate crisis.",
      "Like most 12-year-olds, Dimakatso Ngcobo isn't a fan of household chores. She wasn't shy about telling CBS News so as she scrubbed an old pot, a few plastic plates and two old peanut butter jars that she and her mom use as cups.",
      "Last year, her mom couldn't afford the rent at their home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, so they were evicted. The mother and daughter walked to the community of Kokotela, a few miles further south, to buy a tiny dirt patch of land for $200. There, they put up a new one-room home made of metal sheeting.",
      "Ngcobo told CBS News that while there's no running water and no toilet, what she missed the most was electricity.",
      "\"It is a bit hard. We don't have much. We don't afford that much,\" she said, adding on a more positive note: \"At least the school nearby is OK, as I want to be a doctor one day.\"",
      "She was also grateful for her world getting just a little bit brighter recently, thanks to the U.S. company d.light, which was created by two co-founders who met at Stanford University's school of design. The company has now connected more than 180 million people in 70 countries to a clean source of energy from solar power.",
      "\"We are very focused on making these products as affordable as possible, and the way we do that is by pay-as-you-go financing, where customers can pay 20 cents a day or 30 cents per day, similar to what they would spend on kerosene or diesel for the diesel generator,\" said d.light co-founder Nedjip Tozun. \"But instead of literally burning away that money, they can invest it into an asset that they are going to own that is going to deliver power for many years.\"",
      "D.light is one of the 15\u00a0finalists in the running for a 2024 Earthshot Prize. Winners will be chosen Wednesday in five categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World and Fix our Climate. The winner in each category will be awarded 1 million U.K. pounds, or about $1.3 million, intended to help scale-up their respective projects.",
      "William, the Prince of Wales and future British monarch, has said he took inspiration from President John F. Kennedy's 1962 \"Moonshot\" challenge to land a man on the moon within 10 years when he created the Earthshot Prize four years ago with the ambition of finding and elevating innovative global climate solutions. The Earthshot initiative's ambitious goal since it launched has been to repair the planet within 10 years.",
      "The Earthshot award ceremony has come to the African continent for the first time this year, with Cape Town in South Africa playing host.",
      "Delegates at the Earthshot awards in Cape Town told CBS News ahead of Tuesday's U.S. national election that they've been disappointed that climate change didn't emerge as a central theme in the presidential race, and they worry it could fall even further from the focus of U.S. policy conversation.",
      "New Yorker Shantha Bloemen, CEO of Mobility for Africa, a start-up that provides green mobility services to rural women in Africa using custom-built electric tricycles and bespoke solar powered batteries, was nominated for an award this year but didn't make the finalist list. She said she was still hoping to find partners in Cape Town this week to help her scale up her company's operations.",
      "\"We need urgent action and strong political leadership to unlock the financing to combat this crisis,\" she told CBS News. \"There are many of us with proven solutions to mitigate the worst impact on those living on the front line of the crisis, but without strong U.S. political leadership, it will be difficult to unlock the finance needed to scale quickly to succeed. Time is not on our side.\"",
      "Prince William acknowledged the networking aspect of the prize initiative Tuesday at an event in Cape Town. Panel host Wanjira Mathia teased the British royal as he sat for a panel discussion, calling the prize \"a large dating service to bring together climate innovators.\"",
      "\"The prize is about visibility, but it's also about scale,\" he said. \"What we hear a lot from innovators is, 'I have a solution and no idea how to scale,' and businesses and leaders who say, 'I have money but don't know where to put it.' So, that's where we created a launchpad, which is a dating service which matches the funder with the solution, and vice versa. And I think this collaboration is key \u2014 if you put all of this into one melting pot, then sparks will fly.\"",
      "\"It's wonderful to see those many brilliant minds and changemakers in a room,\" he said, addressing the audience.",
      "Back in Kokotela, south of Johannesburg, Muriel Nobela can now power her TV, radio and lights thanks to a d.light solar panel on her roof. The panel feeds electricity to an outside light and to a storage battery inside her home, and it all costs her just over $250, which she's paying off in small monthly instalments.",
      "Her neighbor Portia Msomi had always been forced to rely on gas to cook and candles for light in the evenings. Now, it's just a flip of a switch.",
      "\"Aha!\" said Portia, giggling as she hit her new d.light switch to illuminate her home. \"You see, isn't it wonderful!\"",
      "Tozun told CBS News it's that kind of reaction that drives d.light's work.",
      "\"The name of our company is d.light, and that is the emotion that gets us really excited to see in our customers,\" he said, adding: \"There are 2 billion people in the world who have unreliable electricity access, and about 750 million with no access to electricity at all, our goal is\u00a0 to transform the lives of one billion people by 2030.\"",
      "Portia takes a lot of pride in her new solar system. With a huge amount of effort she climbed onto a large trunk to stretch her hand onto her metal roof to grab her solar panel and clean it meticulously. She told CBS News it took her only four months to pay off the $150 cost of the system.",
      "She pointed to various neighbors' homes that had burned down in accidents involving paraffin and candle fires.",
      "\"We are safe now, and have light all the time,\" she said.",
      "Light and safety are important for young Dimakatso Ngcobo, too, but the 12-year-old told CBS News that being connected was one of the biggest benefits of clean power in her home. She can now indulge in her favorite activity: scrolling through TikTok and Instagram.",
      "\"And I love TV,\" she added. \"I really love cartoons.\"",
      "Her infectious laugh also helped to light up the room.",
      "\"I feel happy now,\" she said. \"We don't have much, butI can watch TikTok and dream about my future.\"",

There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The victims were identified by the foreign ministry as Yuli Vanessa Herrera Marulanda and Ronaldo Andr\u00e9s Quintero Pe\u00f1uelas.",
      "Mexico's Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two vehicles -- a gray pickup and a white SUV -- in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty while the incident is being investigated.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country's main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations - in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side - raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas - who have been detained pending charges - claimed they heard \"detonations\" prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

This conclusion was reached after complete toxicological analyses on urine, blood and vitreous humor, carried out in a very short time.\"",
      "Additionally, the release states, \"the lack of defense or self-preservation reflex in the fall, together with other relevant data due to his consumption, allow us to conclude that Liam Payne was not fully conscious or was going through a state of noticeable decrease or abolition of consciousness at the time of the fall.\"",
      "The autopsy was reportedly completed and concluded and \"the delivery of the body to the father of the deceased, Geoff Payne\" was carried out last weekend.",
      "Payne had one child, a 7-year-old son, Bear, with ex-girlfriend Cheryl Cole.",
      "Per the release, the investigation is ongoing, stating: \"Beyond the evidentiary forcefulness that was achieved so far (visual, registry, medical, scientific, documentary, telephone, testimonial, etc.), the investigation must continue, since, among other procedures, the unlocking of the victim's personal netbook \u2014 which is broken \u2014 and other devices seized in the investigation are still ongoing.\"",

      "Voters headed to the polls believing the country was on the wrong track (70%, up from 60% who felt that way four years ago) and seeking something different: most wanted a change in how the country is run, with roughly a quarter seeking complete and total upheaval.",
      "Those seeking complete change in the country\u2019s affairs voted for the former president by a wide margin.",
      "Voters\u2019 frustrations with Joe Biden\u2019s administration were a drag on Harris\u2019 candidacy, as nearly 6 in 10 disapproved of the job Biden has done.",
      "Voters had rosier recollections of Trump\u2019s time in office, with half approving of the job he did as president. Four years ago, 47% approved of the job Trump had done.",
      "This desire for change was coupled with split views on the role of government. Slightly more than half felt the government should be doing more to solve the country\u2019s problems, a modest decline from 2020 (57%). Some 45% felt the government was doing too many things better left to the private sector.",
      "Profile of the Vote",
      "The nation\u2019s deep divides \u2013 by gender, education, and area of residence \u2013 were on vivid display. Men backed Trump by 10 points, while women went for Harris by 8 points. The 18-point gender gap was a touch wider than 2020 (17 points).",
      "In 2020, Trump won men by 5 points and Biden won women by 12.",
      "This divide was readily apparent in views of societal gains for women. Some 4 in 10 Trump supporters (43%) were concerned that society\u2019s focus on gains for women had come at the expense of men; just 14% of Harris felt that way. Overall, 29% were concerned.",
      "Voters without a college degree went for Trump by 12 points; college-educated voters went for Harris by 15 points. Harris\u2019 showing among college-educated voters was 1 point worse than Biden\u2019s 2020 showing among college-educated voters, while Trump bettered his 2020 numbers among noncollege voters by 4 points.",

      "Trump had a particular advantage among White voters without a degree (+29 points), thanks in large part to his 38-point edge among noncollege White men.",
      "Harris won college-educated Whites by 8 points and college-educated White women by 16 points \u2013 both in the ballpark of Biden\u2019s 2020 margins (+7 points and +21 points, respectively).",
      "Overall, White voters backed Trump by 12 points, exactly the same as his 12-point advantage in 2020.",
      "Trump ran up the score in rural areas (+26 points, up from a 22-point edge in 2020), while Harris ran slightly behind Biden\u2019s 2020 numbers in urban areas (+28 points, compared to Biden +33).",
      "Suburban voters backed Harris by 6 points, less than Biden\u2019s 10-point margin four years ago. Suburban women, a major source of strength for Biden (+19 points), went heavily for Harris (+16 points) \u2013 but she lost ground among suburban men (Trump +5 points, compared to +1 for Biden).",
      "While the election was, in part, about the deep divides in American society, Trump\u2019s success in attracting traditional Democratic constituencies was also a defining feature. He improved on his 2020 numbers among Hispanics (41%, +6 points), Black voters (15%, +7 points from 2020), and young voters (46%, +10 points).",
      "FOX NEWS PROJECTS DONALD TRUMP DEFEATS KAMALA HARRIS TO BECOME 47TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "These rightward shifts were particularly notable among Hispanic men (+8 points), Black men (+12 points from 2020), and men under 30 (+14 points).",
      "Seniors, who backed Trump by 3 points in 2020, were once again in the former president\u2019s column.",
      "Trump won Catholics by 9 points and Protestants by 22 points, while Harris held the edge among Jewish voters (+34 points), Muslims (+32 points), and the religiously unaffiliated (+40 points).",
      "White Catholics favored Trump by 20 points, while White evangelical Christians broke for Trump by a massive 59-point margin.",
      "Voters similarly divided along lines of religious attendance: Trump won those who regularly attend services (of any denomination) by 22 points; Harris won those who infrequently or never attend by 13 points.",
      "The vice president won union households (+12 points, down from Biden\u2019s 14-point edge in 2020). As he did in 2020, Trump had an advantage among military households (+13 points) and gun owner households (+26 points).",

      "Harris\u2019 best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals, and urban voters.",
      "That each candidate successfully appealed to their base is hardly surprising in a hyper-partisan political environment. Most Democrats (95%) backed Harris; slightly fewer Republicans (92%) backed Trump.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) considered themselves part of the MAGA movement. And while the Harris campaign touted endorsements from prominent Republicans, she was unable to convince enough non-MAGA Republicans to cross the aisle.",
      "Just 7% of voters self-identified as true independents, meaning they do not lean toward one party or another. Harris had a 7-point advantage with this pivotal swing group, a decline from Biden\u2019s 15-point edge in 2020.",
      "Harris was able to appeal to political moderates (+17 points), though once again to a lesser degree than Biden (+26 points in 2020).",
      "Most voters (89%) were locked into their choice of candidate for months, while the small number of late deciders split evenly.",
      "Views of the Candidates",
      "In a time of domestic discord and international conflict, Trump was able to project significant strength of character. A majority saw him as a strong leader; fewer felt that way about Harris.",
      "Voters also believed Trump would capably handle a crisis (54-48%) and had the right policy ideas (52%-47%).",
      "Harris had advantages on personal character (53% vs 43% for Trump), honesty (47%-41%), and having the mental capacity to serve as president (57%-52%). Equal numbers thought each would look out for people like them (48%-48%).",
      "But in an election where voters wanted change, slightly more thought Trump would bring positive change (51%-48%).",
      "Trump\u2019s voters were largely motivated by support for the former president (79%) rather than a vote against Harris (21%). Two-thirds of the vice president\u2019s supporters (66%) described their vote as for her; 34% as against Trump.",
      "On balance, voters had slightly more favorable views of Harris (48% favorable, 50% unfavorable) as a person than Trump (47% favorable, 51% unfavorable). The same was true at the vice-presidential level: views of Tim Walz (43% favorable, 42% unfavorable) were marginally better than opinions of JD Vance (43% favorable, 45% unfavorable). Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his third-party presidential bid and endorsed Trump in August, was just a touch less popular than the two running mates (42% favorable, 43% unfavorable).",
      "Harris\u2019 best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals and urban voters. (Fox News)",
      "Although he won, Trump was unable to fully rehabilitate his image during his time out of office: four years ago, his favorable rating was under water by 7 points (46% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable).",
      "The spotlight was less kind to Biden, whose sharply negative favorability rating (40% favorable, 58% unfavorable) slipped significantly from four years ago (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable).",
      "Views of the candidates were shaped over the course of a condensed campaign marked by a string of earthshaking events: the criminal cases against Donald Trump, two assassination attempts against the former president, Biden withdrawing from the race after the first debate, and Harris attempting to be the first woman elected to the presidency.",
      "Relatively few voters (13%) said the possibility of electing the first woman president was the most important factor to their vote. Harris won these voters by a wide margin \u2013 but a third backed Trump to deny Harris the chance to be the first female commander-in-chief.",
      "The image of a bloodied and defiant Trump after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, clearly galvanized his supporters, as 16% said the attempts were the most important factor to their vote, and they overwhelmingly backed Trump.",
      "Voters had a net-positive view of the Secret Service (52% approve, 46% disapprove), though 62% of Trump voters disapproved of the job the organization is doing.",
      "Opinions of the Supreme Court (50% approve, 49% disapprove) were evenly divided, while two-thirds disapproved of Congress (31% approve, 68% disapprove).",
      "Views on the Issues",
      "As voters headed to the polls, they said the economy was far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion.",
      "Four in 10 voters (40%) said inflation was the single most important factor to their vote, and they backed Trump by almost two-to-one.",
      "Harris countered Trump\u2019s advantages on inflation and immigration by winning the 26% who focused primarily on abortion by 41 points and the 50% who prioritized the future of American democracy by 27 points.",
      "Nearly one-third (31%) said freedom of speech was most important to their vote, and they went somewhat more narrowly for Trump (+8 points).",
      "As voters headed to the polls, they said the economy was far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion. (Fox News)",
      "Voters had a negative view of the economy: nearly two-thirds rated it as not good (40%) or downright poor (24%). Four years ago, in the depths of a coronavirus-induced recession, only 14% said economic conditions were poor.",
      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady.",
      "Those who said they were getting ahead went for Harris by 42 points and those holding steady backed her by a narrower 6-point spread, while those falling behind went for Trump by 29 points.",
      "Nearly all voters were concerned about being able to afford food (91%, including 67% very concerned), and most were worried about paying for health care (84%, 54% very concerned), housing (79%, 51% very), and gas (79%, 48% very).",
      "Voters preferred Trump to Harris by 9 points on handling the economy and by 5 points on taxes.",
      "Despite preferring Trump on the economy, voters split on his signature economic policy, increasing tariffs on goods imported to the United States.",
      "Trump\u2019s advantage on immigration was larger than his edge on the economy, as voters preferred him on the issue by 15 points.",
      "Over the course of the campaign, Trump promised \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history\" \u2013 and succeeded in changing voters\u2019 minds on the issue. Four years ago, 70% believed undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status, while 29% felt they should be deported. Voters\u2019 views this year were markedly different.",
      "Relatedly, two-thirds favored limiting the number of immigrants allowed to apply for asylum \u2013 a policy adopted by both the Trump and Biden administrations, but more closely associated with Trump.",
      "Voters also thought Trump would do a better job handling crime than Harris by 9 points.",
      "Harris\u2019 advantages on climate change (voters preferred her to Trump by 18 points) and abortion (Harris +18 points) outpaced Trump\u2019s edge on immigration and crime.",
      "All told, nearly two-thirds (63%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from the 59% who felt that way four years ago, before the repeal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The balance was closer, however, when voters considered a ban after 15 weeks: 46% in favor, 53% opposed.",
      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady. (Fox News)",
      "A slim majority opposed banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors who identify as transgender. The Trump campaign spent millions of advertising dollars highlighting Harris\u2019 past support of gender-affirming care for the incarcerated.",
      "Even if they did not agree with her on transgender health care, voters saw Harris as better able to handle health care more broadly (by 8 points) and largely envisioned a more active government role. Majorities felt the government should be more involved in lowering the price of prescription medication (75%), eliminating medical debt (58%), and ensuring individuals have health insurance coverage (58%).",
      "Slightly fewer, 50%, said the government should be more involved in ensuring children are vaccinated against common preventable diseases, but just 22% wanted the government less involved in vaccinations.",
      "A week before the election, Harris used a speech at the Ellipse in Washington \u2013 the site of the Jan. 6, 2021, Trump rally that preceded the violent events at the Capitol \u2013 to cast Trump as a threat to American democracy.",
      "A 55% majority was concerned Trump would move the country closer to authoritarian rule, while less than half (46%) felt Harris posed a similar threat.",
      "Even so, majorities felt each candidate\u2019s views were too extreme.",
      "Voters split over how much responsibility Trump bore for the violence at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Harris won those who felt Trump had a great deal of responsibility by 86 points, while Trump won those who felt he was not to blame at all by 91 points. The group in the middle \u2013 who felt he was somewhat responsible for the violence \u2013 went for Trump by 40 points.",
      "In general, slightly more voters felt the way Republicans talk about politics leads to violence (56%) than felt the same about Democrats (50%).",
      "Despite unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in the 2020 election results and Trump raising similar concerns about the 2024 contest, three-quarters of voters (75%) were confident votes would be counted accurately at the national level, and even more were confident in their state\u2019s ability to properly count the vote.",
      "While 31% lacked confidence that ineligible voters would be prohibited from voting, that was down from 35% who felt that way four years ago. Few (9%) worried that eligible voters would be prevented from casting ballots.",
      "Overall, 89% felt both candidates were obligated to accept the results of the election once all the votes were counted and the inevitable legal challenges were resolved. The vast majority of Harris voters (95%) and Trump voters (82%) felt there was an obligation to accept the results.",
      "Trump countered Harris\u2019 closing argument by suggesting Harris was too weak and untested to respond effectively in a crisis. Three-quarters thought Harris had been tested, and these voters felt she had delivered negative results by a 5-point margin. Most voters felt Trump had been tested, and slightly more felt he had delivered positive results than negative ones.",
      "The ongoing violence in the Middle East served to reinforce Trump\u2019s argument about leadership in a crisis, as voters believed he would do a better job handling the situation.",
      "Voters favored continuing aid to Israel to fight Hamas and Hezbollah by 9 points, while favoring continued aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression by 11 points.",
      "There was a marked shift in voters\u2019 views of America\u2019s role in the world. Just 20% wanted the country to take a more active role in solving the world\u2019s problems, down from 37% who felt that way four years ago. Roughly equal numbers said the current approach was about right (38%) or preferred a less active role (40%).",
      "States",
      "Georgia swung back to the Republican column after Biden eked out a win by the slimmest of margins in 2020. With the margins so narrow, the smallest shifts from 2020 would have been enough to flip the state to Trump. Instead, he got substantial movement among constituencies Democrats were counting on to keep the state blue.",
      "Harris won women by 5 points, down from Biden\u2019s 10-point advantage in 2020. She won voters under age 30 by 9 points, down from +19 for Biden. There was a similar shift among Black voters, who form the backbone of Democratic support in the Peach State: from Biden +86 points to Harris +71 points.",
      "The shift among Black men was particularly consequential, as they went for Harris by just 51 points after breaking for Biden by 76 points four years ago.",
      "Harris was counting on a strong performance in the suburbs to offset Trump\u2019s strength (+31 points) with rural voters, but here again she came up well short of Biden\u2019s mark: winning by just 3 points, a far cry from Biden\u2019s 12-point win.",
      "Trump was dominant with White voters without a college degree (78%) and White evangelical Christians (82%).",
      "Trump appealed to voters across the state on economic grounds and found a ready audience, as huge numbers said they were concerned about paying for necessities like food (93%), health care (87%), gas (84%), and housing (83%).",
      "Georgia voters trusted Trump over Harris on the economy by 8 points.",
      "Voters preferred Harris by a wider margin (19 points) on abortion. Harris highlighted the case of Amber Thurman, the Georgia mother who died waiting for care after complications from an abortion pill, as an example of the harms of abortion bans.",
      "Trump, on the other hand, shone a spotlight on Laken Riley, a nursing student allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant while jogging in February. His message on immigration proved compelling, as voters favored him on the issue by 17 points.",
      "Overall, 54% would prefer illegal immigrants be deported, a substantial increase from the 32% who felt that way in 2020. Less than half (44%) said undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status.",
      "Georgia was a focal point for controversy after the 2020 election, but 8 in 10 voters were confident this year\u2019s votes would be counted accurately.",
      "Trump triumphed once again in North Carolina, as Republicans have now won 10 of the last 11 presidential elections in the state. Barack Obama\u2019s narrow win in 2008 was the only Democratic victory since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency.",
      "Trump posted similar results to 2020 among White voters without a college degree (74%, vs 69% four years ago), rural voters (63%, up 3 points from 2020), and White evangelical Christians (87%, up 1 point from 2020).",
      "That alone might have been a winning formula \u2013 but shifts among Black voters and voters under age 30 pushed Trump over the top.",
      "Overall, young voters backed Harris by just 8 points after going for Biden by 16 points four years ago. The shift was entirely powered by young men, who backed the former president by 16 points. Women under 30 went for Harris by 25 points.",
      "The story was similar among Black voters: Black women were nearly universal in their support for Harris (93%), while 19% of Black men backed Trump, up from 6% in 2020.",
      "Overall, 88% of Black voters picked Harris, down substantially from Biden\u2019s 94%.",
      "Harris won political moderates, a group that voted for Biden by 26 points, by just 16 points. She had hoped to run up the margins in the suburbs, but Trump more than held his own with 44% of the vote, up from 43% in 2020.",
      "Just 12% of North Carolina voters said they were getting ahead financially, while almost three times as many (31%) said they were falling behind \u2013 and these voters broke heavily for Trump.",
      "Some 42% cited the economy as the top issue facing the country. Harris kept the race close by nearly battling Trump to a draw on who could better handle the economy. Overall, voters trusted him over her by 5 points.",
      "Still, the 41% of voters who said inflation was the most important factor to their vote broke for Trump by 31 points, 65%-34%.",
      "In the governor\u2019s race, Republican Mark Robinson faced allegations of discriminatory remarks and inappropriate online behavior. The scandals did not help Republicans retake the governorship, which Democrats have now won in 8 of the last 9 elections.",
      "A majority (56%) held unfavorable opinions of Robinson, while more than half (52%) viewed Democrat Josh Stein favorably.",
      "Trump endorsed Robinson, but a majority of voters said the endorsement did not affect their view of the former president.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "In 2020, Biden declared victory after Pennsylvania was finally called for him nearly four days after the election. This time it is back in Trump\u2019s column, though only barely \u2013 a continuation of the state\u2019s see-saw between the parties after Trump\u2019s less-than-one-point victory in 2016, and Biden\u2019s similarly narrow margin four years later.",
      "Trump pulled it off a bit more comfortably, with big wins among some of his mainstay groups: rural voters (63%), White voters without a college degree (62%) and men (55%).",
      "Those margins, combined with improvements among some traditionally Democratic groups, were enough to flip the state red once again.",
      "As he did elsewhere across the country, Trump made notable gains among young voters and Black voters in Pennsylvania, driven almost entirely by improvements among men. He won 23% of Black men, a 17-point bump for him from 2020.",
      "Trump won 23% of Black men, up 17 points from 2020. (Fox News)",
      "He won men under age 30 outright after losing them by 13 points four years ago.",
      "Trump won men under age 30 outright after losing them substantially four years ago. (Fox News)",
      "He also won 47% of the suburban vote, compared to 44% in 2020. His improvement in the suburbs was fueled by suburban men, a group he won outright after getting 47% of their vote in 2020.",
      "Trump won 47% of the suburban vote, fueled by suburban men, a group he won outright after getting 47% of their vote in 2020. (Fox News)",
      "Harris ran strong among women, college-educated voters and suburban women. She campaigned in the state with Republican Liz Cheney in an attempt to reach anti-Trump and moderate Republicans, but managed to pull in only 7% of Republican voters overall \u2013 less than the 9% Biden received in 2020. She got 59% among moderates \u2013 enough to keep the election close but not enough to put her over the finish line.",
      "Harris got 59% among moderates \u2013 not enough for her to carry the state overall. (Fox News)",
      "The economy ranked as the top concern for Pennsylvania voters, and more trusted Trump on the issue than Harris by 8 points. Just over 4 in 10 said inflation was the most important factor to their vote \u2013 those voters went for Trump by 37 points. And, only 11% said they were getting ahead financially, compared to the 32% who said they were falling behind. Twice as many of those voters went for Trump as chose Harris.",
      "Trump\u2019s support for fracking, an important industry in the state (and an issue on which Harris shifted positions), also had an impact: 63% of Pennsylvania voters wanted to see more of it in the state, and they broke for Trump by 37 points.",
      "Immigration is another issue where Trump\u2019s message appeared to sway voters. Nearly half (45%) said they would prefer to see illegal immigrants deported rather than given a chance for legal status, up from 31% who felt that way in 2020. Some 27% said immigration was key to their vote, and voters gave Trump a double-digit advantage on the issue.",
      "A majority of voters (53%) held a favorable view of Gov. Josh Shapiro, more than viewed Harris (47%) or Trump (48% favorably). Whether Shapiro, who was under consideration for Harris\u2019 vice president, could have helped her carry the state if he would have been on the ticket is one of the major unanswered questions of this election.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "In 2016, Trump was the first Republican to win Wisconsin\u2019s presidential vote since Ronald Reagan in 1984, and he did so by the narrowest of margins (less than 1 percentage point). He lost by a similarly miniscule margin in 2020 but managed flip the script this time around.",
      "Across the country, Trump\u2019s winning formula involved holding on to his base and making significant inroads with young men, Black men and Hispanics. Wisconsin was somewhat different: It was a remarkably close race driven by small shifts in support rather than big swings among traditional Democratic constituencies.",
      "Trump did well among his base of conservatives (89%, +1 point from 2020), White evangelicals (75%, -3 points), rural voters (58%, +1 point) and those without a college degree (55%, +2).",
      "He got 48% among men under age 30, up just a touch from his 45% mark four years ago. He lost ground among non-White men (37%, compared to 42% in 2020).",
      "But, the smallest improvements loom large when the statewide margins are so slim \u2013 and even more so when those improvements are among very large groups. Trump gained 2 points among men and 1 point among Whites, and that made all the difference.",
      "Trump gained 2 points among men compared to 2020. (Fox News)",
      "He was also able to keep it close in the suburbs, which Harris needed to offset his strength in rural areas. Biden won the suburbs by 4 points in 2020; the margin was 5 points this year.",
      "Biden won the suburbs by 4 points in 2020; Harris' margin was 5 points this year. (Fox News)",
      "Trump also managed to increase his vote share among moderates (41%, compared to 34% in 2020) by just enough.",
      "Trump upped his vote share among moderates by just enough. (Fox News)",
      "Issues on the minds of suburban voters also played to Trump\u2019s advantage. Immigration was the second-most important issue to Wisconsin voters, and he carried those who said immigration was the most important factor to their vote by 71 points.",
      "Immigration was the second-most important issue to Wisconsin voters, and he carried those who said immigration was the most important factor to their vote by a huge margin. (Fox News)",
      "He was also seen as better equipped to handle the issue: 55%, compared to 34% for Harris.",
      "Trump also won the law-and-order vote: 37% said they were very concerned about crime in their own communities, voters thought Trump was better on crime than Harris by 14 points, and those highly concerned about crime went for the former president by 30 points.",
      "Transgender issues, including gender surgeries for inmates and transgender people participating in women\u2019s sports, also became an issue during the campaign. Over half of Wisconsin voters (55%) said they thought support for transgender rights has gone too far.",
      "Abortion rights were a major emphasis of Harris\u2019 campaign, and she led Trump by a wide margin among voters who said it was their number-one issue (+48 points) and those who believed abortion should be legal (46%). Harris was also seen as better able to handle abortion policy by 23 points.",
      "Overall, Harris did well with women (53%), particularly with college-educated women (65%).",
      "In the end, it came down to the economy: it was the top issue for voters overall (40%), 31% said they were falling behind financially, and 64% felt the national economy was in bad shape. Nearly 4 in 10 said inflation was the most important factor to their vote, and they went for Trump by 39 points.",
      "In the Senate race, the Badger State\u2019s tendency toward ticket-splitting helped pull incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin over the finish line. In her 2018 race, about 10 percent of voters who backed the Republican candidate for governor also voted for Baldwin.

      "Michigan is back in Trump\u2019s column after Biden carried the state by less than three percentage points in 2020.",
      "Trump did so by garnering large margins among men (55%), rural voters (59%) and White voters without a college degree (61% points). But, like he did in many of the swing states, he also managed to make inroads among some traditionally Democratic groups, which helped swing the state back his way.",
      "He won 11% of Black voters, up from 6% in 2020. He was particularly successful in appealing to Black men.",
      "Voters under age 30 split evenly, as Trump improved on his 2020 performance among young men (+13 points) and young women (+14 points).",
      "He also managed to boost his share of the suburban vote. He didn\u2019t carry the suburbs \u2013 Harris did by 4 points \u2013 but he did better among these voters by 3 points compared to 2020, which helped him pull off the win. He won 62% of the Catholic vote, an improvement from the 55% support he got among this quintessential Rust Belt group four years ago.",
      "Harris did well among Black women, urban voters, suburban women and college-educated voters. She also ran strong among those for whom abortion was a major issue, including those who said abortion should be legal (+36 points) and who said the issue was the most important factor to their vote (+51 points).",
      "But, the economy was the top issue for Michigan voters, and voters felt Trump would handle it better by a 10-point margin.",
      "The situation in the Middle East was also a major issue for Michigan voters; the state has a large Muslim population. Overall, the 11% who said the Middle East was the most important factor to their vote went for Trump by 25 points.",
      "Trump also did well among those who preferred expanding domestic production of oil and gas rather than alternative energy sources. Before the election, some Michigan autoworkers raised concerns about Harris\u2019 electric vehicle policy, saying it was costing jobs in the state.",
      "In the end, it may have been impossible for the incumbent party to pull off a win when so many voters felt the country was on the wrong track \u2013 including some 70% of Michiganders. Those voters backed Trump by 38 points. Biden did not do Harris any favors, as only 41% of Michigan voters approved of the job he has done.",
      "In the Senate race to replace 24-year incumbent Debbie Stabenow, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a fellow Democrat, pulled off a narrow win against Republican Mike Rogers. Voters did not quite warm up to Rogers: 44% viewed him favorably, compared to 47% favorable for Slotkin.",

      "\"I think what was so interesting during this campaign is we consistently saw Kamala Harris and the Democrats try to put women in a box,\" Noem told Fox News Digital. \"They tried to define women as only caring about abortion and their health care. They didn't really give them due credit for being the individuals out there that are raising families and caring about their children's education and paying their bills and pursuing their careers.\"",

Voter concerns about the economy and immigration propelled Trump's triumphant return to the White House. But he also expanded his base with traditionally Democratic constituencies, including Black, Hispanic and young voters, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis.",
      "The election showcased many of the nation's deep divides, particularly in gender. Men voted for Trump by 10 points, while women supported Harris by 8 points. The 18-point gender gap was slightly bigger than in the 2020 presidential election (17 points).",
      "That widening was due to Trump improving 5 points among men since 2020. But Harris also under-performed with women compared to President Biden, who won the female vote by 12 points.",

      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents.

      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",

      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

      "Top ways to keep your Social Security number safe",
      "Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account,\u00a0if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",

The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",

      "What you need to know",
      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",

The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices.

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

      "The new\u00a0iMac, announced Oct. 28, comes with the M4 chip, featuring an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU. If you remember\u00a0Apple\u2019s iPad announcement earlier this year, the M4 chip debuted with the iPad Pro (7th generation).",
      "The new\u00a0iMac now comes with accessories that use USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a \"nano-texture glass\" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.",
      "There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.",
      "The\u00a0M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It\u2019s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8.

      "As the name suggests, the\u00a0Mac Mini\u00a0is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",
      "There\u2019s also a $1,399 Mac Mini model that features the new M4 Pro processor, which boasts a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU. It also supports up to 64GB of RAM and up to an 8TB SSD.",

The entry-level 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro still starts at $1,599, but Apple has upped the starting RAM to 16GB (a welcome boost from the previous 8GB).

      "Apple\u2019s updates to the Mac lineup bring impressive changes, especially for power users. The new\u00a0iMacs, now powered by the M4 chip, offer serious performance boosts. But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.",
      "What\u2019s also worth mentioning is Apple Intelligence, which Apple announced way back in May but is only now rolling out. I tried some of these features, and while I found them useful, they\u2019re not exactly earth-shattering.",

      "Data brokers collect, aggregate and sell your personal information, including your phone number, with the intent to sell it to interested parties. They can get your information in many ways, by accessing public information like government records or gathering data from loyalty card programs, surveys and social media. Mobile apps can also share your personal information with data brokers. Even your online browsing habits are valuable to data brokers. Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud.

      "\"We\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\" Hallan said.",

      "\"There has never been any indication that the United States affords Russia any legitimacy to its reasons for invasion.\u00a0While a cease-fire in place may be sought, there is no indulgence of Russia\u2019s ostensible grievances or demands,\" Wurmser said, adding, \"In contrast, regarding the Palestinians, the October 7 attack was blasted as a horror and Israel\u2019s immediate defense was accepted, but the thrust of U.S. policy almost immediately and certainly with ever greater intensity was that a legitimate grievance underlies Palestinian claims and led to these events.\"",

      "While many Mideast experts see the effort to establish a\u00a0Palestinian state as a failed project, the Biden-Harris administration has embraced Palestinian demands and sought to push Israel to accept a two-state solution before the\u00a0Oct. 7 Hamas invasion and after Hamas massacred nearly 1,200 people in Israel.",
      "The language of Biden and Harris towards Ukraine and Israel also shows a disconnect. In September, after Russian missiles killed more than 50 during an attack on a training facility and hospital, Biden said, \"Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war.\u00a0The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.\"",

Biden and Harris went as far as to threaten Israel with punitive measures if the Jewish state invaded the last stronghold of Hamas in the city of Rafah.

      "Wurmser noted that\u00a0\"Ukraine is not facing an incessant attempt from the first days of the Ukraine war of self-defense to stop the war in a way that allows its enemy to consolidate its gains and pocket a victory.\u00a0Only recently has the United States begun to indicate the preference for, but did not impose material pressure on yet, Ukraine to move toward a cease-fire.

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the presidency has done something no political opponent could: put an end date on his time atop the Republican Party.",
      "Well, sort of.",
      "Trump single-handedly remade the Republican Party in his own image, not only becoming its unquestioned leader but also rewiring what the Grand Old Party stands for. After he emerged on the scene in 2015, former party heavyweights who did not abide by the new MAGA ethos either were cast off to irrelevance or became the subjects of intense lines of attack from Trump and his supporters.",
      "But the fact is that the Constitution bars him from running for president again after a second term. And because Trump cannot run again, the process to figure out who will lead the party next has already begun, featuring a slate of ambitious and eager Republicans who have been eyeing the opportunity for years \u2014 and a fight that will be shaped by the now two-term president.",
      "A dozen Republican elected officials, fundraisers and consultants said in interviews that at least in the near term, it does not matter whether Trump can run again. He will still cast an unshakable shadow over the party, one that influences who can ascend, who will descend and whether the party resets at all to resemble its pre-Trump state or continues on a path focused much more on new policy fascinations like isolationism, culture war-infused fights and tariff-focused economic policy.",
      "\u201cHe will hold on to the party as long as he is still alive,\u201d said a longtime Republican operative who, like others who were interviewed, was granted anonymity to speak freely about what might come next for the party.",
      "\u201cTrump won\u2019t run again,\u201d another said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be a major presence. He will relish his role as kingmaker and everyone sucking up to him.\u201d",
      "A longtime swing-state Republican operative said: \u201cThe Never Trump Republicans are gone; they are all now Democrats. The hold-your-nose Republicans will be firmly in the new Republican Party. And Reagan Democrats and union workers are now the base of the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "With Trump\u2019s victory, there is a sense, some of it driven by members of the Trump family, that Vice President-elect JD Vance now becomes the natural heir apparent to the MAGA and Trump legacy. It is not something Trump himself talked about in the final weeks of the campaign \u2014 but it was the implicit signal sent by his selection of Vance as his running mate just two days after a would-be assassin targeted him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.",
      "And Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., a huge Vance ally, has directly framed Vance\u2019s role that way.",
      "\u201cWe are getting four more years of Trump and then eight years of JD Vance!\u201d Trump Jr. said last week as he campaigned for Ohio Senate candidate Bernie Moreno.",
      "Vance will now sit next to Trump in the White House for the next four years, giving him the dual opportunities to build or mend some relationships with the professional political class as he also leans into an outsider reputation the Trump base loves.",
      "\u201cJD has impressed. He had a shaky start, but he has steadied himself,\u201d a veteran Republican operative said. \u201cThe professional class in D.C. despises him, yet that\u2019s among his best sales pitches.\u201d",
      "Outside of Vance, a long list of ambitious Republicans think they will have the inside track to lead the Republican Party in a post-Trump landscape.",
      "\u201cA Trump win means [the 2028] field will be slower to develop,\u201d a longtime Republican operative said. \u201cEveryone will wait to see how Vance\u2019s relationship with Trump goes and how he performs.\u201d",
      "\u201c2026 midterms will be key,\u201d the person added.",
      "As that slow burn plays out, a field to try to succeed Trump after 12 years atop the GOP could include up to a dozen Republican heavyweights, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who was Trump\u2019s final 2024 primary opponent), Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, among most likely a handful of others.",
      "\u201cIt will need to be someone with enough Trump street cred but also dynamic communicators who have mastered retail politics and can raise a bunch of money,\u201d a swing-state Republican operative said.",
      "There are differing opinions about who that person might be as the way-too-early view of what a post-Trump Republican presidential nominee could look like takes shape.",
      "\u201cTrump is the most transformative political figure since Ronald Reagan. ... I do believe he has permanently transformed the Republican Party and the overall national political landscape,\u201d said a Republican lobbyist and fundraiser who has raised money for Trump. \u201cLooking to 2028, the two top prospects, of course, would be JD Vance as a sitting vice president and Gov. Ron DeSantis as the most successful Republican governor in modern history.\u201d",
      "DeSantis, who is term-limited in Florida, was at one point seen as a front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination. He raised record sums of political cash for a governor and pushed policies in Florida that opened up new fronts in the culture wars for conservatives, and he was competing with, and at times beating, Trump in many early-cycle polls.",
      "But DeSantis\u2019 stock dropped quickly in a primary campaign against Trump, and his campaign and his super PACs spent heavily only for him to be out after Iowa, the GOP\u2019s first nominating contest. That precedent, others said, could be his downfall when he considers a future run.",
      "\u201cWhy would anyone give money to him after 2024?\u201d asked a Republican member of Congress. \u201cHe spent so much money, made so many promises and totally flamed out. I\u2019m not sure how seriously I would consider him at this point.\u201d",
      "There are also arguments for several candidates who have been rising stars in Republican Party politics, even if they are not as well known among the broader voting base.",
      "\u201cHuckabee Sanders has bona fides in Trump world, is a rock star on the campaign trail, and with a party hunting for women \u2014 and one of the best campaigns in the party \u2014 will be in her second term as a popular governor,\u201d a longtime Republican Party lobbyist and consultant said. \u201cAnd she will still only be 46.\u201d",
      "That person predicted a \u201cway-too-early\u201d GOP 2028 ticket of Vance-Huckabee Sanders.",
      "Ramaswamy, an avowed Trump supporter and campaign surrogate,\u00a0could also get a boost in a scenario in which he replaces Vance as a senator from Ohio: \u201cIf he does get that spot, he will have a continued huge platform to amplify his message that the Trump base clearly likes,\u201d a former Ramaswamy consultant said.",
      "With Trump now having four more years in the White House, it is extremely unlikely that the party will be looking to make any huge policy or political shifts. But there are also a handful of potential candidates who have done enough to appeal to the Trump base but are seen broadly as more traditional Republicans.",
      "Fitting that bill is Youngkin, whom some \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans saw earlier in the 2024 election cycle as a long-shot hope to move the party past Trump. Since then, though, he has become a reliable Trump supporter and was at one point considered as a running mate.",
      "Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, also fits that mold.",
      "She ran a bruising primary campaign against Trump, saying she would not \u201ckiss the ring\u201d after she became the candidate of anti-Trump Republicans in the primaries. Then, she said she would support and vote for Trump, even though her support at public speeches has been tepid at times.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s noisy out there,\u201d Haley said last month at a rally near Pittsburgh for the Republican Senate nominee in Pennsylvania. \u201cWhen I tell you to take the emotion out and focus on the policies, Dave McCormick can\u2019t win if we don\u2019t elect Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.\u201d"

      "President-elect Donald Trump has carried Nevada over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race, NBC News projects.",
      "Trump lost the state\u2019s six electoral votes in both of his previous runs for the White House. But those defeats against Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden were both by less than 2.5 percentage points, and Trump and the Republican Party have made significant strides with Latino voters and other voting blocs key to the state since then.",
      "While Nevada elected a Republican governor in 2022 \u2014 Trump-endorsed Joe Lombardo \u2014 Democrats managed to hold on in other close races up and down the ballot, a recurring theme in recent years. But Trump\u2019s victory is a breakthrough for the GOP in a state that Democrats have mostly dominated of late. Republicans hadn\u2019t won the presidential contest there since 2004.",
      "Trump made Las Vegas a frequent stop on the campaign trail, repeatedly promoting his \u201cno tax on tips\u201d pledge, in a state where a significant number of residents work for tipped wages in the entertainment and hospitality industries. Trump announced the proposal at a Las Vegas campaign rally in June.",
      "Harris also backed it and promoted her support in her visits to the state, including in August, when she touted backing from the likes of the powerful Culinary Union. Harris visited Las Vegas several times, too, after she became the Democratic nominee in the summer.",
      "Trump won Nevada after six Republican \u201cfake electors\u201d were indicted last year on forgery charges over their alleged submission of fake certificates to Congress declaring Trump the winner in the state four years ago. A Nevada judge dismissed the case in June 2024, ruling that it was filed in the wrong venue. Nevada\u2019s attorney general, Democrat Aaron Ford, appealed the ruling in July.",
      "Nevada relies heavily on mail-in voting, which Trump and Republican allies railed against in the 2020 election and since. But the party made a more concerted effort this year to encourage voters to use mail balloting, with Trump urging his supporters to cast their ballots in any way possible."

      "President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday named co-campaign chair Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, one of the most important nonelected posts in Washington.",
      "She will be the first woman in that role.",
      "Wiles, 67, a Florida native, is one of the most respected operatives in Republican politics. Along with helping helm Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign, she was his state director in Florida during the previous two contests.",
      "\u201cSusie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,\u201d Trump said in a statement Thursday. \u201cSusie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected.\u201d",
      "Trump called his 2020 campaign \u201csuccessful,\u201d even though he lost the race to Joe Biden. For years, he has continued to make baseless claims that that election was stolen.",
      "Before she joined Trump\u2019s team, Wiles helped lead Rick Scott to victory as governor of Florida in 2010. He is now a U.S. senator. Wiles was also brought in to help save the 2018 campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won after initially having floundered.",
      "After Trump\u2019s resounding victory Tuesday over Vice President Kamala Harris, there was an overwhelming sense that Wiles was the front-runner to be White House chief of staff.",
      "\u201cIf she wants it, it\u2019s hers,\u201d a Trump adviser told NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cHer standing with Trump and what she just pulled off [winning by a huge margin] makes it an easy choice if she wants it.\u201d",
      "Turns out Wiles wanted the position, and now her role as de facto chief of staff will become official as the work of building a new administration begins.",
      "Wiles, the daughter of famed football player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, has professional roots planted in Republican politics going back to the 1970s.",
      "She started as assistant to Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., in the House in 1979, was a personal secretary to Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan during the Reagan administration and spent significant time earlier in her career in Jacksonville, Florida, where she was a top staffer to Republican mayors John Delaney and John Peyton.",
      "She entered Trump\u2019s orbit ahead of the 2016 election cycle when Trump was looking for someone to help him navigate Florida\u2019s at times choppy political waters. He was plunging into a crowded pool of Republican candidates from Florida that included former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m told you know something about Florida,\u201d Trump told Wiles when they first spoke on the phone, NBC News reported in March.",
      "That phone call was followed up by Wiles\u2019 making a trip to Trump Tower in New York City. He eventually hired her.",
      "Since then, she has generally been a part of his inner circle. Beyond working for DeSantis in 2016, a relationship that ended on a bad note, Wiles has also worked in the private sector for the lobbying firm Ballard Partners and for Mercury, a public affairs firm. She remained with Mercury throughout the 2024 presidential contest.",
      "Wiles did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night on her new position.",

      "At President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election night celebration on Tuesday, a list of alternative media stars with massive followings of young Americans received an impromptu shoutout.",
      "\u201cI want to thank some people real quick: The Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin\u2019 With The Boys and, last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan,\u201d Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial arts promotion company, said on stage.",
      "The names \u2014 shows and personalities that hosted Trump on their programs during the campaign \u2014 comprise a who\u2019s who of the most influential shows among young American men. And in an election in which his campaign specifically courted that demographic, the shoutout hinted at what has so far been borne out in exit polling data.",
      "Trump picked up a larger proportion of voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2008, according to NBC News exit polling, improving with both young men and young women. In 2020, President Joe Biden beat Trump by 11 percentage points among young men; this year, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 2 points. Among young women, Biden\u2019s 35-point lead over Trump in 2020 shrunk to a 24-point lead for Harris. Among young white men without college degrees, Trump beat Harris, 56% to 40%.",
      "Researchers at Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement saw similar trends.",
      "This year, \u201cit\u2019s not the case that young people overwhelmingly supported Democrats,\u201d said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the center's director.",
      "Young people, more than older voters, typically rely on people in their communities whom they trust, Kawashima-Ginsberg said. That could help explain the influence of internet personalities, like Rogan, who interviewed Trump for his podcast and endorsed him on the eve of the election.",
      "\u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d is the most popular podcast in the United States, according to data from Edison Research, with 56% of its listeners aged 18 to 34, according to YouGov, and 81% male. Other prominent male influencers who endorsed Trump, like YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, also have demographics that skew young and male.",
      "\u201cIf you are a Joe Rogan listener and you feel inspired by the interview and want to talk to others about it, that has a real impact,\u201d Kawashima-Ginsberg said.",
      "Another major motivating factor among young people this year was the economy.",
      "Researchers picked up on this trend months before the election, noting that voters under 30 were struggling financially, uncertain about their futures and were driven more by pocketbook concerns than issues that seemed more distant, like the future of democracy \u2014 or even abortion and immigration.",
      "That turned out to be the case.",
      "NBC News exit polls showed that the economy ranked as the most important issue among young voters, and those who chose it as the top issue voted for Trump 78% to Harris\u2019 21%.",
      "\u201cEvery candidate and party had an opportunity to really listen to young voters and hear what they really wanted,\u201d Kawashima-Ginsberg said. \u201cIn this case, one candidate did reach them on economy.\u201d",
      "On Monday, NBC News spoke with several first-time voters in Pennsylvania who planned to vote for Trump. All of them cited the economy as their primary motivation.",
      "Ryan Jones, 21, said that he was a fan of Trump\u2019s proposal to not tax tips or overtime. Jones said he had worked jobs where his income was based on tips and, had those policies been in place at the time, he would\u2019ve been able to save more for college.",
      "\u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to live. People can\u2019t afford gas. People can\u2019t afford food. People can\u2019t afford rent. The cost of living has gone up in these last four years, and I think that everyone here has been a victim of that,\u201d said Jaiveer Bajwa, 19, of Pennsylvania.",
      "Kaeli Bennet, 18, said that when Trump was president, \u201cprices were a lot lower especially for homebuyers, and that is a huge issue for me.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appearances on popular podcasts consumed by largely young male audiences may have bolstered his appeal to that demographic. Trump said his son Barron Trump, 18, urged him to appear on Rogan\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI think him hopping on like Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast helped, and I remember he said that he actually took advice from his son Barron, because Barron would know what younger guys like, right?\u201d\u00a0Angel Sobolewski, 21, of Ohio, told NBC News by phone on Wednesday. She said she voted for Trump.",
      "In addition to Rogan\u2019s podcast, Trump made an appearance on \u201cThis Past Weekend w/ Theo Von,\u201d which racked up 14 million views on YouTube. On the podcast, Trump seemed fascinated with Von,  who usually focuses on comedy and culture.",
      "\u201cIs cocaine a stronger up? So you\u2019re way up with cocaine \u2014 more than anything else you can think of?\u201d Trump asked Von.",
      "Those clips, viewed largely by Von\u2019s young, white and male demographic, appeared not only humorous but humanizing when it came to Trump.",
      "Harris also broadened her outreach by appearing on several popular podcasts, including\u00a0Alex Cooper\u2019s \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d which has millions of listeners, primarily women.",
      "When President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid in July and quickly endorsed Harris, she became the subject of many memes, including the prominent \u00a0\u201cBrat\u201d summer trend.",
      "She also received endorsements from organizations like Gen Z for Change, an activist group that has been mobilizing youth voters since 2016.",
      "While some praised her strategy \u2014 several of her appearance clips went viral \u2014 her outreach efforts didn\u2019t appear to give her a boost at the polls with young voters.",
      "In the end, Trump\u2019s outreach eclipsed Harris\u2019.",
      "Anil Cacodcar, student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, said Trump successfully engaged with young men, particularly on college campuses, who are influenced by Rogan, Von and other right-leaning internet hosts. Many of these men feel left out of economic opportunity.",
      "\u201cThe message Trump has for young men is very simple \u2014 you have been wronged by the Biden/ Harris administration because their economy is imposing too many taxes on you, you\u2019re not making as much money as you were before the pandemic,\u201d Cacodcar said. \u201cAnd he used the podcasts to set out this policy vision.\u201d"

      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, senior national political reporter Jonathan Allen explains why Democrats need to retool their economic message during Donald Trump's second term. Plus, senior national politics reporter Matt Dixon writes that the battle to succeed Trump in four years is already underway. And \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker asks Trump about his mass deportation plans in an interview.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "How Trump broke both parties \u2014 and where Democrats go from here",
      "Over the course of the last decade, President-elect Donald Trump broke both national political parties.",
      "He first stormed into the 2016 Republican primaries with both an agenda and a style that sharply cut against GOP conventions. Since then, the Democratic Party has defined itself by opposition to him, rather than its own values and platform. President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020 looks, now more than ever, like an electoral brake tap in a race away from the establishment.",
      "For most of the last 20 years, American voters have been screaming that they don\u2019t believe their government serves them well. Before Trump, Democrats nominated \u2014 and the country twice elected \u2014 Barack Obama, a candidate who ran against leaders that walked the country into forever wars and a finance-and-housing crisis that nearly toppled the economy.",
      "Add to that this nugget: This is the first time since 1896 that voters have ousted the incumbent party in three straight presidential elections. (In the 1880s and 1890s, they did it four consecutive times.)",
      "In this election, there was no greater symbol of the aimlessness of the two parties\u2019 old guards than the Cheney family and the Democratic presidential nominee wrapping their arms around each other in an embrace that they somehow didn\u2019t find awkward. Their marriage of convenience gave more credence to Trump\u2019s arguments that elites serve their own interests first.",
      "Like Obama\u2019s two elections, Trump\u2019s second win was decisive by modern historical standards. There\u2019s no need to tally how many thousands of votes he won by in the closest swing states.",
      "But if there\u2019s a silver lining \u2014 or a ray of hope \u2014 for Democrats, it is that the national shift in the electorate can still be measured as a handful of percentage points. This wasn\u2019t Ronald Reagan taking everything but Minnesota and the District of Columbia in 1984.",
      "Democrats have time now to assess how their party can become more responsive to public sentiment as they look forward to the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., harshly criticized them for alienating white, Black and Latino working-class voters. He might be the wrong person to make that case \u2014 given that he was an architect of and cheerleader for Biden\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 but he has a point.",
      "Democrats would be smart to start with the issue that Trump hammered\u00a0on \u2014 and which was the top concern of the plurality of his voters: the economy.",
      "For four years, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris tried to convince voters that their plans were working instead of shaping their agenda to respond to the economic pain so many Americans feel. First, they said inflation wasn\u2019t a problem. Then they said it was transitory. Eventually, they noted that its rate was slowing. With little exception \u2014 hard-to-implement promises to ban price-gouging \u2014 they hardly stopped to acknowledge the harm cumulative inflation wreaked on working families.",
      "They threw out facts and figures to explain that the economy is in better shape than its counterparts across the world. Harris\u2019 economic policy offerings were largely expansions of Biden proposals, such as more generous homebuyer and child tax credits than he called for. In the political equivalent of Bill Buckner booting a ground ball in the World Series, Biden didn\u2019t warn the public when he took office that the pandemic spending of the previous year was likely to cause inflation.",
      "But the other thing Biden and Harris failed to do \u2014 despite the president\u2019s reputation for empathy \u2014 was listen to the outcry for help and shape their agenda around it. Democrats will have no one to blame but themselves if they don\u2019t figure that out before the next election.",

      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the presidency has done something no political opponent could: put an end date on his time atop the Republican Party.",
      "Well, sort of.",
      "Trump single-handedly remade the party in his own image, not only becoming its unquestioned leader but also rewiring what the Grand Old Party stands for. After he emerged on the scene in 2015, former party heavyweights who did not abide by the new MAGA ethos either were cast off to irrelevance or became the subjects of intense lines of attack from Trump and his supporters.",
      "But the fact is that the Constitution bars him from running for president again after a second term. And because Trump cannot run again, the process to figure out who will lead the party next has already begun, featuring a slate of ambitious and eager Republicans who have been eyeing the opportunity for years \u2014 and a fight that will be shaped by the now two-term president.",
      "A dozen Republican elected officials, fundraisers and consultants said in interviews that, at least in the near term, it does not matter whether Trump can run again. He will still cast an unshakable shadow over the GOP, one that influences who can ascend, who will descend and whether the party resets at all to resemble its pre-Trump state or keeps following a path focused much more on new policy fascinations like isolationism, culture war-infused fights and tariff-focused economic policy.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday told NBC News that one of his first priorities upon taking office in January was to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful.\u201d When questioned about his campaign promise of mass deportations, Trump said his administration would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to carry them out.",

      "\u201cWe obviously have to make the border strong and powerful and, and we have to \u2014 at the same time, we want people to come into our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, I\u2019m not somebody that says, \u2018No, you can\u2019t come in.\u2019 We want people to come in.\u201d",
      "As a candidate, Trump had repeatedly vowed to carry out the \u201clargest deportation effort in American history.\u201d Asked about the cost of his plan, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not \u2014 really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here. There is no price tag.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many undocumented immigrants there are in the U.S., but acting ICE Director Patrick J. Lechleitner told NBC News in July that a mass deportation effort would be a huge logistical and financial challenge.

      "For many Democratic voters, Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump was disappointing but not surprising, they said in interviews, agreeing that their party hadn't done enough to talk about the economy and lamenting lingering racism and sexism.",
      "Democratic voters in battleground states say they see many reasons for her defeat: the abbreviated campaign, a lack of economic messaging, a drift too far to the left on social issues, the war in Gaza and bias against Harris because she is a woman of color.",
      "Trump seized on Americans\u2019 economic frustrations while he drew young men and Latino voters, in particular, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "Laytza Hernandez, 18, said that she voted for Harris but that many of her Mexican relatives voted for Trump because of his clearer message about the economy.",
      "\"They just felt like he was speaking more to their concerns,\u201d said Hernandez, a student at Arizona State University.",
      "Sami Khaldi, 58, the president of the local Democratic club in Dearborn, Michigan, said many in the community were \"angry\" about the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza and used their votes in protest. Voters in Dearborn, America's only Arab-majority city, broke decisively for Trump over Harris, a departure from Joe Biden\u2019s beating Trump there in 2020.",
      "More broadly, he said, Khaldi believes the Democrats need to go further to win over rural voters. Trump made a concerted effort to campaign in solidly blue states such as New York, Illinois and California, where, he said, Democratic policies, including about immigration and crime, have faltered.\"They need to rethink their strategy by widening their base and reach out to red states, not just the blue states or swing states,\" Khaldi said. \"I understand these swing states are very, very important, but I think we need to build a stronger foundation.\"",
      "While Harris was saddled with having to introduce herself to voters in a shortened campaign season after Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, her supporters acknowledged she also had to walk a fine line between touting the administration's successes and presenting herself as a change candidate.",
      "\"She needed more time,\" said Luis Muza, 20, a Latino and Democratic voter in Milwaukee. \"If she had more time, it would\u00a0have\u00a0been a much closer race.\"",
      "Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former senior adviser on the Biden campaign who hosts MSNBC\u2019s \"The Weekend,\" said Harris \"left it all on the field\" as she crisscrossed the country ahead of Election Day.",
      "But Sanders-Townsend said that as she spoke with Democratic strategists and officials in swing states such as Pennsylvania, many expressed dismay at the perception that Harris' campaign seemed focused on issues that weren't necessarily pertinent to voters more concerned about inflation and their finances.",
      "One particular attack ad by the Trump campaign stuck out, Sanders-Townsend said: It featured Harris saying in the 2020 campaign that she would support giving trans inmates access to gender-affirming care and a narrator declaring, \u201cKamala is for they/them.\u201d",
      "\"The question that some of these voters had, according to the strategists on the ground, said, 'Hey, if that's what they're focused on, they're not focused on me,'\" Sanders-Townsend said. \"Some of the soul-searching is about how can the message break through. Because the idea that Democrats don't have an economic agenda that speaks to some of these working people, which is not true, but do the people feel it is the difference.\"",
      "MJay Hawkins, a student at Arizona State University, said it seemed like the Harris campaign may have focused too much on \"things that people are not comfortable with.\"\"So they chose Trump,\" Hawkins said, \"because they presented him as a Christian in a way that he's going to stop people with gay marriages and all of that stuff.\"",
      "For some Democrats, the possibility that Harris, a Black and South Asian woman whose victory would have been historic, could have become president wasn\u2019t lost on them. Her ability to peel off more white female voters \u2014 who have traditionally supported Republicans \u2014 amid larger concerns about women's access to abortion care and reproductive rights was noteworthy, although some Democrats worry that the electorate still isn\u2019t ready for a female president, much less a female president of color.",
      "\"I was really praying that she would get it,\" said Deborah McKinnon, 68, a Black Democratic voter from Pittsburgh. \"And then I was thinking, when [Hillary] Clinton was running, for some reason, society didn't want a female to win, so that also came to my mind this morning because she's a female. Regardless of race, they didn't want her to win.\"",
      "Gary Tate, another Black Democratic voter in Pittsburgh, agreed that gender was most likely a factor in an election in which Trump managed to lure more young men to the polls.",
      "\"No one's ready for a woman president,\" Tate said, adding that he liked Harris' stance on abortion rights.",
      "Harris' loss can't be understated, said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a national organization supporting women of color in politics, which she started after Trump's 2016 win. Both Black women and men voted overwhelmingly for Harris, according to an NBC News exit poll, and Allison said Democrats can't afford to lose their base at a time when other demographic groups are shifting Republican.",
      "One in 3 voters of color went for Trump \u2014 the best performance of any Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election effort \u2014 the exit poll found.",
      "\"It just underscores that Black women are the most loyal Democrats, and they were the power behind Kamala Harris' campaign,\" Allison said. \"The country could learn a lot from what we've done.\"",
      "John Park, 37, a Black Democratic voter in suburban Atlanta, said that as a warehouse worker for an automotive company, he initially liked Trump's \"pro-America\" approach. But he snapped back toward Harris after he listened to an episode of Steve Harvey's radio show in which Harvey pointed out that convicted felons couldn\u2019t vote but that now a candidate with a felony conviction had another opportunity to become president.",
      "Park blamed Biden for not having stepped aside earlier. \"He didn't trust her when she was beside him,\" he said.",
      "The Rev. Luis Cort\u00e9s, who leads Esperanza, a Philadelphia nonprofit organization that provides services and advocates for Latinos, said Trump did something Harris didn\u2019t: He \"tapped into men's psyche\" after \"very little was done for that population in the inner cities of our country, for Black and Hispanic men.\"",
      "He said it seemed as if Harris didn't emphasize the same interest in economic development \u2014 and apparently the controversy in recent days about a racist joke made about Puerto Ricans at a Trump rally failed to galvanize some Latinos to support Harris, instead.",
      "\"So they were open to a conversation with Donald Trump and his leadership,\" Cort\u00e9s said, \"and obviously that conversation gave them more hope with Trump than it did with Harris.\""

    "summary": "The national exit poll shows 78% of Black men selected Harris in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, down 2% points from the last election.",
    "story": [
      "Black men had been perceived as a voting bloc ripe for Donald Trump to attract after many expressed concerns a year ago about Joe Biden\u2019s re-election efforts. An NBC News poll at that time showed that at least 20% of Black men would support Trump \u2014 an alarming number for Democrats.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris took over from Biden, who stepped aside under pressure in July. In the end, however, the poll from November 2023 held true: 78% of Black men selected Harris in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, according to the NBC News National Exit Poll. That figure was below Biden\u2019s 2020 mark of 80%.",
      "For one Black pollster, the reasons behind Harris\u2019s performance is not complicated. Alvin Tillery, a professor of political science at Northwestern University and founder of the super PAC Alliance For Black Equity, said the Harris campaign used failed strategies to engage Black men, \u201ceven after all the talk about how critical it was to get their vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was political malpractice,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "Harris introduced an Opportunity Agenda for Black Men, outlining what her administration would do to support that voting constituency that seemed movable. That move gained her 10 points, to 71%, in the national polls his organization conducted two weeks before the election, Tillery said. But that effort was one of the few that addressed Black men directly, he added.",
      "\u201cShe needed 83-84% of the Black male vote,\u201d he told NBC News. He said his organization had been raising concerns that Democrats needed to pick up more Black men to replicate 2020. \u201cThe reality is this should not come as a surprise to anyone. They were warned repeatedly throughout the year that they were not doing enough with the Black male segment. It was great to see her energy in the last two weeks, but it needed to come earlier and needed to be more targeted with digital ad spending.\u201d",
      "Tillery pointed out that he was not pinning the election results on Black men. Overall, 86% of Black voters backed Harris, according to NBC News\u2019 exit poll. That figure is reflected among all age groups, though 94% of Black voters above the age of 60 voted for Harris.",
      "Black men younger than 30 and older than 65 were the most likely to support Harris at 78% and 87%, respectively. Also, 73% of men ages 30-44 and 76% of men 45-64 supported the vice president.",
      "\u201cBlack men did nothing wrong in this election,\u201d Tillery said. \u201cThat\u2019s important. The Democrats failed to message to them by running their candidate as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, which, frankly, turned a lot of the Black men off. And then they didn\u2019t give them anything on the other side to scare the hell out of them about Donald Trump. And that is a recipe for softer turnout and a higher vote share for Trump.\u201d",
      "Darius Jones, founder of the National Empowerment Black Action Fund, agreed. \u201cTo imply Black men, a historically disenfranchised group, singularly hold the key to election outcomes is reductive and dismissive of the broader coalition-building that\u2019s always necessary for victory. We must avoid casting Black men as scapegoats and saviors.\u201d",
      "Jones added that the numbers should be considered with nuance.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, that level of support is substantial and highlights the unwavering commitment and resilience of Black men to the Democratic Party and the causes they believe in,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOn the other, it reflects a broader trend where nearly a quarter of Black men are exploring alternatives.\u201d",
      "The Democrats, he said, should not ignore this. \u201cFor decades, Black men have been the backbone of progressive causes, yet there\u2019s an increasing sense among many that their unique concerns are sidelined,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment where political leadership should reflect on not just the support they have, but the support they risk losing.\u201d",
      "Tillery said he believes that support for Harris would have been more significant if the campaign had taken a more aggressive approach that showed how Trump\u2019s policies would affect Black men. One 30-second ad his PAC produced breaks down how Project 2025, a conservative plan for Trump\u2019s second term, would mean increased policing of Black men. (Trump has said he has \u201cnothing to do with Project 2025,\u201d though the 900-page document was written by some of his allies and former aides).",
      "\u201cOur goal was to let people know that Donald Trump is going to implement a national stop and frisk policy,\u201d Tillery said. \u201cVP Harris\u2019s campaign needed to pick up that mantle and run ads like that, talk about that more in digital ads, instead of in appearances.\u201d",
      "Marcus Hans, a Black voter who attended Harris\u2019 election night watch party at Howard University, said he felt like his vote was coveted by the Harris campaign. But much of the attention he received was via text messages that included asking for donations.",
      "\u201cI donated once and the texts never stopped,\u201d Hans, 57, said. \u201cIt became annoying. I understood it, but it made me question if they were more interested in money than me. I was voting for her anyway. But it did cross my mind.\u201d",
      "Harris made a concerted effort, especially in the waning days of the campaign to court the Black vote. She did interviews on urban radio stations and nationally syndicated shows and visited spaces like Black-owned barbershops. Trump, meanwhile, leaned on some famous Black male supporters, including controversial former NFL standouts Antonio Brown and Le\u2019Veon Bell, while also pitching himself to men in general through social media influencers, creators and podcasters.",
      "But the exit poll shows that Harris did not make headway with those efforts.",
      "\u201cMy concern is they are still doing politics as if it\u2019s like 1984,\u201d Tillery said. \u201cGoing to the barbershop, and having these rallies with wealthy people saying \u2018I support Kamala\u2019 isn\u2019t working.\u201d",
      "Jones seemed to agree: \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that the realities facing Black men are multifaceted,\u201d he said. \u201cConcerns about economic empowerment, public safety, cultural representation and educational opportunity weigh heavily on our community. While the campaign made efforts and should be acknowledged for doing so, there remain areas where deeper, more targeted engagement could have made a stronger impact on Black men\u2019s concerns. There were missed opportunities to create a deeper dialogue and tangible policy commitments that spoke directly to our lived experiences.\u201d"

      "Harris would have been the first Black woman and South Asian person to hold the nation\u2019s highest office, and with her defeat by President-elect Donald Trump called Wednesday morning, they\u2019re reflecting on the spotlight her unprecedented candidacy put on their community.",
      "\u201cI was speechless,\u201d said Anjali Bhatt, 27, who saw the results online when she woke up Wednesday morning. \u201cThe fact that there could have been a South Asian woman in the White House \u2026 we\u2019re not there yet, but it would have been very nice. For the South Asian community, there\u2019s that added level of grieving.\u201d",
      "Bhatt, a Washington, D.C., resident, said Trump is the only Republican presidential candidate she\u2019s ever seen on the ballot. She said she thought Harris might have offered a reprieve \u2014 and a sign that America is moving forward.",
      "In Mississippi, Sumati Thomas, 42, said she was hit with similar feelings when she saw the results Wednesday morning. As a Black and Indian woman, she felt particularly connected to Harris\u2019 multiracial identity. Despite the loss, she said Harris\u2019 Democratic nomination earlier this year and ascent to the vice presidency in 2020 put her community on the map.",
      "\u201cEveryone that I\u2019ve talked to is just kind of solemn today,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cBut I really hope that, in the history books, this loss doesn\u2019t diminish in any way the accomplishments that Kamala Harris has had. Just seeing her and having someone that looks like me, being able to look up to that is great.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 campaign and the attention paid to her race shone a spotlight on a community of South Asian Americans that makes up less than 2% of the U.S. population.",
      "She reinvigorated a bloc whose excitement was fading under President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race. Sixty-eight percent of Indian Americans lean Democratic, and in the days after Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a massive mobilization effort began.",
      "Groups like South Asians for Harris and movements like \u201cLotus for POTUS\u201d quickly sprang up; many were spearheaded by women who felt an immediate kinship.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of disappointment in that sense,\u201d said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. \u201cFor Kamala Harris, I think there was a sense of belonging and identity, and that definitely is lost. We don\u2019t have anyone [South Asian] on the horizon who could rise to that level. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 South Asian touchstones",
      "Though Harris didn\u2019t often touch on her race or gender during her presidential campaign, she did regularly mention her mother, the late scientist and Indian immigrant Shyamala Gopalan.",
      "\u201cMy mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream,\u201d Harris said in her speech at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Gopalan was born and raised in Chennai, a South Indian city, before she moved to the U.S. to attend the University of California, Berkeley. There, she became involved in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s before she eventually became a leading breast cancer researcher.",
      "She steeped her daughters in all things South Asian, said Harris, who grew up eating South Indian food, like potato curry and masala dosa, and hearing Gopalan speak Tamil.",
      "Harris saw her mother confront racism in the U.S. as a new immigrant.",
      "\u201cMy mother was a brilliant 5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent,\u201d Harris said in her convention speech. \u201cAs the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool.\u201d",
      "In her 2019 memoir, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d Harris recounts her experiences visiting India and the influence her mom\u2019s father, P.V. Gopalan, had on her early political consciousness. He was involved in the Indian independence movement, she wrote, and often spoke to her about the importance of fighting for civil rights.",
      "Her maternal grandmother, who never finished high school, she wrote, was a community organizer, taking in abused women and helping them rehabilitate their families.",
      "Thomas said Harris\u2019 candidacy and persona awakened people in her circles and got them excited to go to the polls.",
      "\u201cThe vibes were not as joyous earlier in the year, and the fact that she was able to re-energize the Democrats in the way that she did is also such a great accomplishment,\u201d she said.",
      "Where voters feel she fell short",
      "While Thomas feels Harris ran a near-perfect campaign, Bhatt said there are areas where the Democratic agenda missed the mark. Like many young and progressive Asian Americans, she said Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip has been an important issue for her.",
      "\u201cI was really disappointed in how they handled that,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have loved if she had met with the uncommitted movement, with Palestinian leaders in Southeast Michigan, if they\u2019d had a Palestinian speaker at the DNC.\u201d",
      "South Asian Muslims in the U.S. make up the largest percentage of all Muslim Americans, a group that has long expressed solidarity with Palestinians and disappointment with Biden\u2019s handling of the war.",
      "Harris didn\u2019t take the opportunity to distance herself from Biden enough on that issue or introduce different ideas, Syed said.",

      "Syed said a stronger focus on the economy would have also drawn in more Indian American voters, who are on average the highest earners in the U.S., with a median household income of $145,000.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to raise the profile of the Indian American community,\u201d Syed said.",
      "In the meantime, South Asian voters say they have no choice but to keep pushing. They have been through this before when Trump was elected in 2016, they said, and they\u2019re not entirely losing hope about the work that can be done at the local and state level.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is hug your kids and try to assure them that things will be OK,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe have lost the presidency, but there\u2019s still city, state, county elections coming up, and we can\u2019t lose focus.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 21:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Whether the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students can be punished with the death penalty if convicted will be the focus of a planned hearing Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "The defense team for the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022 said Thursday that his trial should not permit the death penalty as punishment, arguing that the state has \"no real means\" of executing an inmate and the methods are unconstitutional.",
      "The death penalty hearing in Boise, Idaho, on whether suspect Bryan Kohberger can be executed if he is convicted, came as the campus community prepares to mark next week two years since the quadruple homicide in the college town of Moscow.",
      "\"I don't believe our Constitution allows for us to move forward and make him sit in death row for years and years and years if the way Idaho is doing it right now isn't really working,\" Ann Taylor, Kohberger's public defender, said. \"It's not a realistic option.\"",
      "\"So you're saying the anxiety of not knowing is a constitutional violation?\" Ada County District Court Judge Steven Hippler asked.",
      "Taylor continued: \"It is anxiety. It is fear. It is the not knowing.\"",
      "But Latah County prosecutors responded that Idaho's current method of execution, lethal injection, is now available, and while the method could change down the line, \"we don't have the time and effort debating what we don't know in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't get to short-circuit the whole thing that death is off the table,\" prosecutors said, adding \"that's not to say decades from now there's not going to be a method to put him to death.\"",
      "Idaho currently allows death by lethal injection for condemned inmates, as well as firing squad, which Republican Gov. Brad Little signed into law last year as an alternative method.",
      "While the death penalty in Idaho remains on the books, it hasn't been used since 2012 because the state, like many others, has had trouble procuring lethal injection drugs.",
      "That changed in February, when the state located the necessary drugs and planned to execute Thomas Creech, who was convicted of five murders in three states. But the state abandoned the execution after prison staff failed to establish an IV line, exposing the difficulties with administering the death penalty.",
      "Another execution attempt of Creech, 74, had been scheduled for Nov. 13 \u2014 coincidentally, the same date in which the four University of Idaho students were fatally stabbed in 2022 in an off-campus apartment house. Creech's execution was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week as he appeals.",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Taylor said it is unclear whether there would still be available drugs, and keeping Kohberger on death row would be \"dehumanizing.\"",
      "\"Looking forward, we just don't have those answers yet,\" Taylor said. \"We don't know how that will unfold.\"",
      "Hippler denied the defense's request to hear from expert testimony regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, the judge also heard arguments about whether Kohberger may pose a danger to others.",
      "Prosecutors have said in court filings that four aggravating factors exist in the case against Kohberger, who turns 30 later this month, making the crime more severe and the death penalty warranted. They are that there are multiple victims; the murders were \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\"; the suspect exhibited \"utter disregard for human life\"; and he has \"a propensity to commit murder which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society,\" according to the filing.",
      "Taylor on Thursday asked the judge to strike the state's death penalty request, which was based on the claims of aggravating factors.",
      "The defense also suggested allowing for a special phase if Kohberger is found guilty that would require the jury to determine if he is then eligible for capital punishment, an extra step that prosecutors want denied.",
      "Hippler said he would issue a written ruling on the death penalty motion at a later date. He did say he would allow Kohberger to appear in \"civilian\" attire at his trial, and on Thursday, the suspect appeared in court in a suit.",
      "He was arrested in December 2022, more than a month after the four students \u2014 housemates Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20, and Kernodle's boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20 \u2014 were killed. Kohberger was a resident of nearby Pullman, Washington, and then a doctoral student at Washington State University.",
      "A\u00a0not guilty plea\u00a0on four counts of first-degree murder and burglary was entered on his behalf in May 2023. Authorities have not publicly confirmed a motive, and a\u00a0gag order\u00a0has prevented many involved in the case from speaking.",
      "The prosecution says it expects to present\u00a0at trial DNA evidence, details about cellphone use and security videos to connect Kohberger to the crime.",
      "Kohberger's defense has suggested that he often went on late-night drives and that\u00a0cellphone tower data would show\u00a0that he had been doing so miles away when the four students were killed.",
      "Next summer's trial was moved to Idaho's capital of Boise from Latah County after the defense successfully argued there would be a strong possibility for bias among potential jurors and the local community does not have the resources for such highly anticipated proceedings."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic victory has scrambled next week\u2019s three-way contest to replace Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, the chamber\u2019s longest-serving leader who is stepping down at the end of the year.",
      "Two of McConnell\u2019s trusted lieutenants \u2014 Senate Minority Whip John Thune, of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican leader, and Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas, who previously held that role \u2014 as well as Sen. Rick Scott, a conservative bomb-thrower from Trump\u2019s home state of Florida, are all running to be Senate leader after Republicans recaptured the majority in Tuesday\u2019s election.",
      "A third John who was considered a potential candidate, GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, of Wyoming, decided not to run for the top job and will run for the No. 2 majority whip post instead.",
      "Because of their years in leadership and relationships across the GOP Conference, Thune and Cornyn have been seen as the most likely successors to McConnell. But the pair have broken with Trump on several occasions and have spent the year trying to make amends with the past and now future president.",
      "With Trump returning to power, Scott and his conservative allies are making the case that he should be the one to run the Senate despite winning just 10 votes when he challenged McConnell for the top job two years ago.",
      "The Trump loyalist personally asked Trump for his endorsement in May when he notified the former president that he was launching a bid for Republican leader, a source familiar with the conservation told NBC News.",
      "\u201cHe supported me when I ran against McConnell two years ago; I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll support me this time,\u201d Scott said on Fox Business Wednesday, adding that he and Trump have been texting back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to make sure his agenda gets accomplished.\u201d",
      "Trump has not publicly weighed in on the race and is staying out of it for now, according to a Republican source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private strategy.",
      "One ally of both Scott and Trump, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., urged Trump to endorse Scott, a former Florida governor who cruised to re-election in the Senate on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve got any influence with President Trump, ask President Trump to come out publicly and say he wants to work with somebody as accomplished as Rick Scott to accomplish his agenda. We\u2019ve got to do big things. We have to deliver,\u201d Johnson told a host on the conservative network, \u201cThe First.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need outside the box, paradigm-shifting type of thinking in the United States Senate and, working with President Trump, he\u2019s going to need something like Rick Scott,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo urge the president to come out and endorse Rick Scott publicly \u2014 it\u2019s probably what Rick\u2019s going to need to become the majority leader.\u201d",
      "But while Trump has been the most powerful Republican in the country for nearly nine years, it\u2019s not clear that an endorsement from him would guarantee a Scott victory. Leadership elections are closed-door affairs and conducted by secret ballot, meaning that a senator\u2019s vote is not publicly known.",
      "To win, a candidate needs a simple majority. If no candidate gets one on the first ballot, the candidate with the least number of votes is cast aside and the race goes head-to-head with the top two candidates.",
      "Triumphant Republicans return to Washington next week. Sen. Mike Lee, of Utah, is planning to host a forum with the trio of candidates on Tuesday. The election will take place Wednesday, and new senators-elect, including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Justice of West Virginia, will be able to participate.",
      "Appearing on CNBC this week, Thune encouraged Trump to stay out of the internal leadership race.",
      "\u201cObviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that, but honestly, I think my preference would be, and I think it\u2019s probably in his best interest, to stay out of that,\u201d Thune said.",
      "\u201cThese Senate secret ballot elections are probably best left to senators, and he\u2019s got to work with all of us when it\u2019s all said and done,\u201d Thune added, \u201cbut whatever he decides to do, that\u2019s going to be his prerogative, as we know.\u201d",
      "Thune\u2019s remarks are interesting given that he likely has the most work to do to convince his colleagues that he\u2019s on the same page with Trump. Thune criticized Trump for his actions around Jan. 6, 2021, as well as some policy proposals and his offensive rhetoric. He endorsed colleague Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in the presidential primary, then backed Trump months later after Scott dropped out.",
      "Just last year, Cornyn said that Trump could not win in 2024, that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s time has passed him by\u201d and that he would be looking for other candidates to back in the GOP primary. Months later, as Trump destroyed his primary opponents, Cornyn endorsed Trump.",
      "In the lead-up to the leadership race, both Thune and Cornyn have been trying to make their peace with Trump. Thune visited him at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in March, and they have spoken several times since then, most recently last week, according to a source familiar with Thune's schedule.",
      "Cornyn joined Trump at a rally in Reno, Nevada, last month for Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown, whose race is currently too close to call, according to NBC News projections. Cornyn also was with Trump during his visit to Texas.",
      "\"As I told President Trump, I'm interested in getting the band back together again,\" Cornyn told Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Monday.",
      "Still, it\u2019s the votes of their GOP colleagues that these candidates will need. And Cornyn and Thune are hoping that their travels and relationships with both current and incoming senators serve as a bridge between the more moderate wing of the GOP conference and the MAGA wing of the party, which was already growing in influence before Trump\u2019s win on Tuesday.",
      "A source familiar with Thune\u2019s operation said he raised north of $33 million this cycle across his accounts, for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and directly for candidates. He was a top fundraiser for the NRSC, and he\u2019s headlined more than 200 events this cycle for candidates and the NRSC, the source said.",
      "Cornyn, who held the whip job before Thune, touts that he was in that job as the GOP leadership's vote-counter when Trump\u2019s tax cuts were passed in the Senate. The Texan also spent October visiting battleground states to campaign with candidates and raised more than $26 million as of the end of September, said a source familiar with his political operation.",
      "He has crisscrossed the country, campaigning for colleagues, including Sen. Ted Cruz, a fellow Texas Republican for whom he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars this cycle."

    "summary": "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares a return to the White House, advisers thinking about how to staff his administration are weighing the merits of stacking Trump\u2019s Cabinet with elected officials versus the mix of businesspeople, political outsiders and loyalists who fill up his Rolodex, three sources engaged in discussions about the transition said.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares a return to the White House, advisers thinking about how to staff his administration are weighing the merits of stacking Trump\u2019s Cabinet with elected officials versus the mix of businesspeople, political outsiders and loyalists who fill up his Rolodex, three sources engaged in discussions about the transition said.",
      "Two sources involved in the transition process said Trump is expected to place a premium on Cabinet selections from outside of government service, as opposed to sitting lawmakers, for two reasons. He sees some of his first-term outside selections, including investor Steven Mnuchin, whom he appointed to lead the Treasury Department, and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as more successful and more loyal than several lawmakers he plucked from Congress.",
      "Trump never forgave Jeff Sessions, the senator from Alabama who became his first attorney general, for recusing himself from the Justice Department's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Former Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., who was appointed secretary of health and human services, and Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who was interior secretary, were dogged by scandal over how they ran their departments and used government resources.",
      "Trump is also wary of special elections to replace sitting lawmakers, especially in the Senate. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a Roy Moore situation,\u201d one of the sources said. Moore was the Republican nominee in the special election to replace Sessions in the Senate, which Democrats won in a rare and dramatic victory in Alabama in 2017.",
      "No decision is final or forecloses on the possibility that Trump will select particular members of Congress. Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., is among those under consideration for attorney general, according to multiple sources. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those who have made it clear they'd be ready to serve in any capacity Trump needs.",
      "But already, a potential contender has bowed out. A prominent surrogate during Trump\u2019s campaign, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. has conveyed that he is not interested in entering the Trump administration, according to three sources familiar with the decision. Along with Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., and Mike Pompeo, who was secretary of state and CIA director in Trump\u2019s first term, Cotton was tipped as a top candidate to serve in a Trump administration as discussions began to pick up in the final months of the campaign.",
      "Cotton, who has two young children, weighed the potential impact on his family significantly in deciding to remove his name from consideration for a Cabinet post, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Cotton is running for a Senate leadership post.",
      "As Trump\u2019s team weighs its personnel decisions, top of mind is what each pick would mean for his agenda.",
      "A campaign official said pulling too many sitting lawmakers from Congress into the administration would affect Trump\u2019s ability to get things done in his first 100 days in office.",
      "And two sources also noted the role of Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as someone with potential veto power over the decision-making. In a recent interview, Trump Jr. said he would work to stop people who could hamper Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cMy job is going to be taking\u00a0out\u00a0and\u00a0stopping\u00a0the\u00a0people\u00a0who will just slow roll \u2014 who are going to be doing\u00a0the\u00a0bidding of\u00a0the\u00a0swamp, not doing\u00a0the\u00a0bidding of\u00a0the\u00a0duly elected President of\u00a0the United States,\u201d he said in October.",
      "The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Rubio, a prominent surrogate for Trump in the final days of the campaign, has been coy about what could come next and has said he has not spoken directly to Trump about a potential slot, but he made it clear he\u2019d be open to a position if he is asked.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in public service. I\u2019m not trying to play quiet,\u201d Rubio said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019m in public service. I like to serve our country.\u201d",
      "A source close to Rubio said he is in a prime position to be selected because his lengthy public service and his recent vetting as a potential running mate to Trump would shorten preparation for an appointment. Rubio would also have a relatively easy confirmation process because of his time in the Senate and his relationships with fellow members.",
      "But as Trump\u2019s team narrows the field, the calculation includes memories of how many people Trump plucked from the ranks of Congress in his first term, except for Pompeo, ended up being disappointments and future political liabilities.",
      "Several also threw their Republican-held seats into peril.",
      "Sessions, an adviser to Trump in 2016, was one of his earliest supporters when Trump elevated him from the Senate to run his Justice Department. Not only did the special election to replace Sessions turn into an embarrassment for the GOP, but Sessions\u2019 handling of his department also frustrated Trump, and Session ultimately resigned. Trump endorsed against him when Sessions later tried to run for his old seat.",
      "After having spent lavishly on chartered flights, Price ran afoul of Trump and his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d ultimately forcing his resignation. The special election to replace him also turned into a centerpiece of Democratic organizing against Trump. Though the GOP won the special election narrowly, Republicans lost Price's congressional seat in the midterms and then watched Georgia turn blue in 2020.",
      "Zinke's tenure at the Interior Department was short. Amid misconduct allegations, Zinke said two years in that he would step aside. He narrowly won re-election to Congress in 2022, when he eked out a 3-point win against an environmental lawyer.\u00a0He won a broader re-election victory this week.",
      "As far as Rubio and his seat are concerned, the source close to him waved off concerns about him in the Senate, in particular given Sen. Rick Scott's 13-point win in the race for Florida's other Senate seat."

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 21:40:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The former Trump attorney had been ordered to turn over his valuables to the two Georgia election workers he repeatedly defamed after the 2020 campaign.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge chastised Rudy Giuliani on Thursday for offering a \u201cfarcical\u201d explanation of why he hasn\u2019t complied with a court order to turn over valuables to former Georgia election workers he defamed after the 2020 presidential campaign.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman made the remark in a New York courtroom after an attorney for Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, claimed he wasn't sure where some of his belongings are.",
      "\u201cThe notion that your client doesn\u2019t have any knowledge of where his assets are located is farcical,\" Liman told Giuliani lawyer Ken Caruso.",
      "Giuliani, a onetime personal attorney to President-elect Donald Trump, had been ordered to transfer personal property, \u201cincluding cash accounts, jewelry and valuables,\" to former election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss by Oct. 29 in order to begin complying with the $146 million defamation judgment.",
      "The judge ordered Thursday's hearing after attorneys for Freeman and Moss said Giuliani had failed to turn over any of the items he was expressly ordered to surrender, which include a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey, a luxury watch collection and jewelry.",
      "Lawyer Aaron Nathan said that when they entered Giuliani's New York apartment last week, they found that the valuables and some furniture had been removed.",
      "Giuliani told reporters Thursday that \"they lied\" about items being moved.",
      "In a court filing, Nathan noted that a real estate listing for the $5.7 million apartment, which Giuliani has to turn over to Freeman and Moss, had shown the framed DiMaggio jersey hanging in the living room. He contrasted that with a picture taken on Oct. 31, when they entered the apartment, showing the jersey and numerous other items were no longer there.",
      "\"There has been nothing but game playing,\" Nathan said.",
      "Giuliani maintains the items have always been where he says they are: in his Palm Beach, Florida, and New York homes and a storage facility in Ronkonkoma on Long Island, New York, which he claims he cannot access.",
      "He has also said he's not sure exactly which assets he still has and where they might be. Nathan pushed back against that assertion in a court filing, calling it \"stunning\" since the list of items came from Giuliani's own disclosures this year in his now-dismissed bankruptcy case.",
      "In court, Caruso tried to argue that there were two items Giuliani shouldn\u2019t have to hand over \u2014 a 1980 Mercedes-Benz that formerly belonged to Hollywood icon Lauren Bacall and a watch that belonged to Giuliani's grandfather.",
      "Giuliani spoke about the watch to reporters before Thursday's hearing, saying \"the law says\" Freeman and Moss are \"not entitled to a lot of\" what they're seeking.",
      "\"For example, they want my grandfather\u2019s watch. It\u2019s 150 years old. That\u2019s a bit of an heirloom. Usually you don\u2019t get those unless you\u2019re involved in a political persecution,\" Giuliani said.",
      "In court, Caruso told the judge it was \"vindictive\" of Freeman and Moss to ask for the watch, a claim the judge angrily shot down.",
      "Liman said he regularly presides over cases in which debtors big and small have to turn over family heirlooms.",
      "\u201cIf they owe a debt, they have to pay a debt. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was handed down,\u201d\u00a0Liman said.",
      "Caruso also argued that his client should be able to keep the Mercedes \u2014 which Giuliani took to Trump's polling place in Florida on Election Day \u2014 and said it was worth less than $4,000.",
      "The judge denied that request and ordered Giuliani to hand over the title and the keys to the car in the coming days.",
      "\u201cAll the property must be turned over to the receiver, and if not I will hold him in contempt,\u201d the judge said of Giuliani.",
      "After court, Giuliani said told reporters: \"I will turn over everything I\u2019m legally obligated to turn over. ... They\u2019ve been less than clear.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for Freeman and Moss noted that both the car and the watch were explicitly mentioned in the judge's Oct. 22 order.",
      "Giuliani was hit with the massive monetary judgment last year after a judge found him liable for repeatedly defaming Freeman and Moss with his accusations that they committed fraud during the 2020 election.",
      "Giuliani's allegations were investigated and found to be meritless, but he hasn\u2019t backed off of them.",
      "\"I did not defame them,\" he told reporters Thursday."

      "\u201cWe accept the choice the country made,\u201d he said in brief remarks from the White House Rose Garden. \u201cI\u2019ve said many times, you can\u2019t love your country only when you win. You can\u2019t love your neighbor only when you agree.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s speech comes exactly four years to the day he was declared the winner of the 2020 election against Trump, who has spent the years since insisting that those results were rigged and attempted to have them overturned.",
      "\"I will do my duty as president: I will fulfill my oath and I will honor the Constitution. On Jan. 20, we\u2019ll have a peaceful transfer of power here in America,\" Biden said Thursday, after encouraging voters across the political spectrum to \"bring down the temperature.\"",
      "Biden acknowledged that the achievements of his administration are not yet being felt by the American people and suggested it will take years to feel the effects. He said legislation he signed into law is only just now \"really kicking in,\" adding that $1 trillion in infrastructure work will get done and will change people's lives in rural communities and other places experiencing difficulties.",

      "Millions of Americans risk losing subsidies next year that help them pay for health insurance following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win and Republicans\u2019 victory in the Senate.",
      "The subsidies \u2014 which expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 came out of the 2021 American Rescue Plan, and increased the amount of assistance available to people who want to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The American Rescue Plan also broadened the number of people eligible for subsidies, extending them to many in the middle class.",
      "The looming expiration date means that the incoming Congress and next president will need to decide whether to extend them \u2014 something Trump and Republicans have already signaled they don\u2019t support, said Chris Meekins, a health policy research analyst at the investment firm Raymond James.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans end up winning the House, in addition to the Senate and White House, having a GOP sweep, I think the odds are less than 5% they get extended,\u201d said Meekins, who was a senior HHS official in Trump\u2019s first term. Even Democratic control of the House likely won\u2019t save the subsidies, he added.",
      "Several important House races have still yet to be decided. As of Thursday afternoon, House Republicans had won 209 seats, just nine short of the majority, according to an NBC News tracker.",
      "In 2024, more than 20 million people got health insurance through the ACA, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Since the 2021 subsidies went into effect, enrollment in ACA plans with reduced payments doubled, particularly in Southern red states, said Cynthia Cox, the director of the program on the ACA at KFF, a nonpartisan health care policy research group.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, extended the subsidies through 2025. In 32 states where data is available, 15.5 million people receive the subsidies, according to KFF.",
      "If the subsidies aren\u2019t extended, the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 a nonpartisan agency that provides budget and economic information to Congress \u2014 estimates that nearly 4 million people will lose their coverage in 2026 because they won\u2019t be able to afford it.\u00a0 Enrollment will continue to fall each year, with coverage reaching as low as 15.4 million people in 2030.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "It\u2019s possible, Cox said, that the current Congress could extend the subsidies during the so-called lame-duck session, though she added that\u2019s unlikely.",
      "\u201cThe election results make it much less likely,\u201d Cox said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re looking at is significant increases in what people pay for their premiums. It\u2019s going to average more than 75% increase. For some people, it will be more than double.\u201d",
      "The subsidies are a hard pitch to Republicans, Meekins said, because they\u2019re expensive. The CBO estimates that it would cost $335 billion over 10 years to permanently extend them.",
      "What\u2019s more, Trump and Republicans in Congress have already said they would make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the health care law.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said if Republicans do take full control of Congress, those changes could be significant.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will likely cut funding for outreach for ACA plans,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cThis means fewer people will know their rights under the law and many will not sign up for ACA health care plans. Trump is also likely to cut Medicaid funding and support states that refuse to expand Medicaid coverage.\u201d",
      "Gostin also noted that \u201cchallenges to the ACA\u2019s preventive services mandate are under way in the courts.\u201d The mandate requires that health insurers fully cover certain preventive services, including cancer screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms, at no cost to the patient.",
      "In June, a federal appeals court said the mandate must stay in place until the case is ultimately decided.",
      "Cox said she expects Republicans to keep dismantling the ACA, similar to Trump\u2019s first term, when they eliminated the tax penalty linked to the law\u2019s individual mandate, which required people to have health insurance or pay a tax. The mandate is technically still in place, but the penalty was reduced to zero.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency, then we might see a repeat of 2017,\u201d she said.",
      "Gostin said eliminating the ACA entirely will be a challenge, even if Republicans control all three chambers.",

    "summary": "Fluoride could be removed from public water systems under the influence of one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s advisers, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Fluoride \u2014 long heralded as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 could be removed from public water systems under the influence of one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s advisers, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 who has no training in either medicine or dentistry \u2014 called fluoride \u201can industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss\u201d and other problems on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cI think fluoride is on the way out,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday on MSNBC. \u201cThe faster that it goes out, the better.\u201d",
      "Whether to add fluoride to water supplies is decided and funded by local jurisdictions, not the federal government. Still, Kennedy said that if tapped, he would advise communities on fluoridated water.",
      "Dentists who care for kids\u2019 oral health say the end of fluoridated drinking water would be detrimental.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t happen right away, but as children continue to grow and develop, they will have an increased cavity rate,\u201d said Dr. Meg Lochary, a pediatric dentist in Waxhaw, North Carolina, an area that recently opted out of adding fluoride to water systems. \u201cWe will eventually see an increase in tooth decay.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluoride exposure through municipal water supplies is especially important for families who don't have dental care.",
      "While an estimated 75% of Americans have fluoridated drinking water, hundreds of U.S. communities are increasingly opting out of water fluoridation.",
      "Caught in the middle are parents trying to make sense of widely differing views on added fluoride. Is it good? Is it bad? Let\u2019s break it down.",
      "What are the benefits of fluoride?",
      "Mouths teem with bacteria, which produce acid in saliva. Those acids weaken teeth and lead to decay. Fluoride counters that process with a one-two punch, by reducing acid and strengthening enamel, the tooth\u2019s protective outer layer.",
      "The phenomenon was discovered in the early 1900s among residents of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Tooth decay was nearly nonexistent in the population. The only thing to explain it was their drinking water, which was naturally high in fluoride that leached from local rocks and soil.",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the world to add fluoride to its water supply in 1945. Within a decade, cavities among young children in the town plummeted by 60%.\u00a0Other public water systems followed.",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0American Dental Association, the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0and the\u00a0CDC, soon supported the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Cavity prevention, experts say, is a major public health coup. Uncontrolled tooth decay can lead to infections, loss of teeth and painful abscesses.",
      "Are there risks from fluoride?",
      "Despite decades of study and real-world evidence of its benefits, fluoride continues to be scrutinized.",
      "To date, there's no damning evidence proving that fluoridated water leads to any of the outcomes Kennedy mentioned, including loss of intellect.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not any evidence that fluoride has lowered the IQ of kids,\u201d said Dr. David Margolius, Cleveland\u2019s director of public health.",
      "There are some small studies, however, worth mentioning.",
      "Research published in May suggested that fluoride exposure during pregnancy could be linked to neurobehavioral issues in kids. The study\u2019s authors, however, said that based on the findings, it's premature to stop adding the cavity-fighting mineral to drinking water.",
      "A 2019 study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that IQ levels were slightly lower in 3- and 4-year-old children whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine when they were pregnant.",
      "While the researchers said it may be time to \u201chit pause\u201d on water fluoridation, they stopped short of saying the mineral should be pulled from water supplies.",
      "In September,\u00a0a federal judge in California ruled\u00a0that even though he couldn\u2019t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations.",
      "What should parents do?",
      "Experts maintain that there\u2019s no credible evidence proving fluoride has lowered kids\u2019 IQ levels.",
      "With science in mind, parents should be able to ask questions about what their kids are consuming, said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.",
      "\u201cAny parent should feel very comfortable asking their child\u2019s doctor, \u2018What should be my approach to fluoride to protect my child\u2019s teeth?\u2019\u201d Besser said. \u201cThose are appropriate questions, but saying that fluoride doesn\u2019t have value flies in the face of the science and evidence.\u201d"

      "\u201cAll eight reported milking cows or cleaning the milking parlor,\u201d Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who heads the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the call. Masks and safety goggles were rare.",
      "\u201cNone wore respiratory protection, and less than half wore eye protection,\u201d Daskalakis said.",
      "Most of those found with H5N1 said they\u2019d had red, itchy eyes with drainage.",
      "But four of the eight who were infected didn\u2019t recall ever being sick.",
      "Until now, workers who had a known exposure to bird flu but didn\u2019t have symptoms haven\u2019t been routinely tested. The new results clearly show cases have been missed \u2014 a concern that veterinarians have had since the spring.",
      "The CDC is now \u201cintensifying\u201d recommendations meant to protect farmworkers, Shah said. \u201cWe in public health need to cast a wider net in terms of who is offered a test so that we can identify, treat and isolate those individuals,\u201d he said.",
      "The new advice is to test anyone with a significant bird flu exposure, such as an unprotected worker who\u2019s been splashed in the face with raw milk on a dairy farm with known H5N1 infections in the herds.",
      "Even if the person never feels ill, that worker should be tested and given the antiviral drug Tamiflu to reduce their risk of ever developing symptoms or passing the virus to close contacts.",
      "It was unclear Thursday where the money for extra tests would come from, but a CDC spokesman said the cost would not fall on individual farms.",
      "This is a move the CDC should have made months ago, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always suspected strongly and now have confirmation that that was going to miss people who are infected,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cThis is very bad because one of these infections could turn out to be serious.\u201d",
      "All the H5N1 cases reported so far this year have been mild, including pinkeye and some minor coughs or sneezes. No one has died.",
      "That runs counter to previous H5N1 mortality rate estimates from other parts of the world suggesting more than half of those who become infected die.",
      "Daskalakis said that could be because \u201cnot all H5N1s are built the same. These are potentially different genotypes.\u201d",
      "There is no indication that the commercial milk or beef supplies have been affected, the Food and Drug Administration has said."

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:44:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The FDA has proposed ending the use of an ingredient in many over-the-counter cold and allergy medications because it doesn\u2019t actually relieve nasal congestion.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday\u00a0proposed\u00a0ending the use of a\u00a0common ingredient\u00a0found in many popular over-the-counter cold and allergy medications.",
      "The agency said an extensive review of available data determined that the ingredient, oral phenylephrine,\u00a0doesn\u2019t actually\u00a0relieve nasal congestion. It comes more than a year after advisors to the FDA\u00a0unanimously reached the same conclusion.",
      "Based on the data, \u201cwe are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\u201d Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a release.",
      "The FDA said the proposed order is not based on safety concerns and not final yet, which means companies can still market over-the-counter drugs containing oral phenylephrine for now. But a final decision would force pharmacies to clear shelves of hundreds of products containing oral forms of the ingredient,\u00a0which is found in versions of drugs such as\u00a0NyQuil,\u00a0Benadryl, Sudafed and Mucinex.",
      "Last year,\u00a0CVS\u00a0said it has already moved to pull certain medicines containing oral phenylephrine.",
      "A final order would also require drugmakers such as\u00a0Procter & Gamble,\u00a0Bayer, and\u00a0Johnson & Johnson\u00a0spinoff\u00a0Kenvue\u00a0to reformulate many of their oral cold and allergy products.",
      "Phenylephrine is thought to relieve congestion by reducing the swelling of blood vessels in the nasal passages.\u00a0Without oral phenylephrine on the market, patients will likely scramble to seek out spray versions of the drug, or other medications with different ingredients, both of which the FDA\u2019s decision does not affect.",
      "Retail stores such as CVS and\u00a0Walgreens\u00a0could also take a hit: Those stores sold 242 million bottles of drugs containing phenylephrine in 2022, which generated nearly $1.8 billion in sales, according to a presentation by FDA staff last year.",
      "The FDA could specifically revoke the drug\u2019s over-the-counter designation as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe and effective.\u201d The designation, typically used for older medicines, allows drugmakers to include an ingredient in over-the-counter products without the need to file an FDA application.",
      "The meeting of FDA advisors last year was prompted by researchers at the University of Florida, who petitioned the agency to remove phenylephrine products from the market based on studies showing they failed to outperform placebo pills in patients with cold and allergy congestion.",
      "The same researchers also challenged the drug\u2019s effectiveness in 2007, but the FDA allowed the products to remain on the market pending additional research.",
      "However, FDA staff, in briefing documents posted ahead of the panel meeting last year, concluded that oral formulations of phenylephrine don\u2019t work at standard or even higher doses. The staff said only a very small amount of phenylephrine actually reaches the nose to relieve congestion.",
      "Representatives for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a group that represents over-the-counter drug manufacturers, did not offer any new evidence to counter the FDA staff\u2019s conclusion about phenylephrine during the meeting last year.",
      "But the group argued that pulling oral phenylephrine from the market would be a significant burden to consumers.",
      "The group shared a survey that found 1 in 2 households in the U.S. used an oral decongestant over the last year. It also found people prefer oral decongestants over nasal spray by a 3-to-1 margin.",
      "Phenylephrine became the main decongestant in over-the-counter cold and allergy medicines in 2006, when sales of another decongestant, pseudoephedrine, were restricted in the U.S.",
      "Pseudoephedrine was moved behind the pharmacy counter because it can be misused to make methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant drug that affects the central nervous system."

      "\u201cA political pyromaniac who must be put before a criminal court,\u201d Jean Asselborn,\u00a0then-foreign minister for Luxembourg, said of Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "\"Trump has ruined it all,\" Croatian President\u00a0Zoran Milanovi\u0107 said, also in 2021. \"He incite[s] hate, he is a rabble-rouser and that\u2019s it.\"",
      "Following Trump\u2019s election victory, at least two of these U.S. allies, the U.K. and Australia, have had to dial back some of their previous attacks.",

      "Lammy pivoted from scathing critic to polite well-wisher, showing that diplomacy sometimes means shaking hands with those you once pointed fingers at.",
      "Lammy, who made his comments about Trump being \u201ca woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d in Time magazine in 2018 when he was a backbench minister of Parliament, had also protested against the then-government\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to this tyrant in a toupee.\u201d",

      "Relations between Britain\u2019s ruling center-left Labour Party and Trump have been antagonistic in the lead-up to the election, with Trump accusing the British of election interference.",

      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the far-right Reform UK party, offered to help bridge Labour's awkward relations with Trump, whom he considers a personal friend with whom he is ideologically aligned, an offer the Labour Party declined."

    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Three people were charged in relation with the death of singer Liam Payne, Argentina's public prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "The prosecutor's statement said that during the investigation, \"illicit conduct was discovered from which three people were charged with the crimes of abandonment of a person followed by death, supply and facilitation of narcotics.\"",
      "Payne, a former member of One Direction, fell from the balcony of a Buenos Aires hotel on Oct. 16.",
      "Someone who was with Payne daily while he was in Buenos Aires is charged with abandoning a person following death, prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea's statement said.",
      "A hotel employee is accused of supplying Payne with cocaine twice while he stayed at the hotel, the statement said, and a third person is accused of supplying drugs to him twice during his stay on Oct. 14.",
      "They are both charged with two acts of supplying narcotics, Madrea said.",
      "Toxicology reports showed that in the last 72 hours before he died, Payne had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant drug in his system, according to the prosecutor's office. The prosecutor's statement made no reference to \u201cpink cocaine,\u201d which ABC News, citing sources, had reported he had in his system when he died.",
      "Payne reportedly had a recreational drug that is typically made up of MDMA, ketamine and methamphetamine in his system. The drug rarely has any cocaine in it, and the pink comes from food coloring, officials have said.",
      "His death was caused by \"multiple trauma\" and \"internal and external hemorrhage\" resulting from the fall from the third-floor hotel balcony, the prosecutor's office said.",
      "Forensic doctors who performed the autopsy told prosecutors that his injuries were consistent with a fall from that height and that self-harm, as well as interference from someone else, were ruled out. They added that because Payne \"did not adopt a reflex posture\" to protect himself during the fall, \"it can be inferred that he may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.\"",
      "Throughout the investigation, \"exhaustive and meticulous actions and measures were taken to clarify the circumstances surrounding the artist's death,\" the statement said. Prosecutors heard testimony from \"several dozen\" hotel staff members, family members, friends, medical professionals, biochemists and psychiatrists.",
      "Prosecutors also analyzed more than 800 hours of security video from the hotel and from public roads, and they looked through the contents of Payne's cellphone.",
      "Also following the investigation, Payne's body was released to his father, Geoff Payne, last weekend.",
      "Payne, who shot to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction, was reportedly exhibiting destructive behavior in the hours before he died.",
      "The hotel where he was staying called 911 after he \"overindulged in drugs and alcohol\" and was \"breaking the whole room.\"",
      "\"The guest is in a room that has a balcony, and, well, we are a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" the caller said, according to audio obtained from local media\u00a0by Telemundo, NBCUniversal's Spanish-language network.",
      "Payne was found dead just minutes after the call was made."

    "story": [
      "A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at Japan's tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site\u2019s highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That\u2019s led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than .01 ounces from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "Germany\u2019s government coalition has collapsed in dramatic fashion after Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner\u00a0of the pro-business Free Democrats in a late-night move following a marathon of crisis meetings.",
      "The three remaining ministers of the Free Democrats resigned in response, leading to the downfall of the government coalition. Scholz is expected to lead the country with a minority government, but the opposition is calling for an immediate no-confidence vote.",
      "But early Thursday, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats unexpectedly took back last night\u2019s resignation and told reporters that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead.",
      "Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. German news agency dpa reported that J\u00f6rg Kukies, an economic adviser to Scholz, will become the next finance minister.",
      "The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, dpa reported.",
      "Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March \u2014 which otherwise would have been be due next September.",
      "Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz\u2019s left-leaning Social Democrats will now effectively lead a minority government with the remaining coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens.",

      "But Merz on Thursday vehemently rejected Scholz\u2019s plan to wait to hold a vote of confidence until January.",
      "\u201cThe coalition no longer has a majority in the German Bundestag, and we therefore call on the chancellor (...) to call a vote of confidence immediately, or at the latest by the beginning of next week.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months now, and then campaign for several more months, and then possibly conduct coalition negotiations for several weeks,\u201d Merz added.",
      "He said he was planning to meet with Scholz later Thursday to push for a quick vote of confidence.",
      "Since Scholz\u2019s government doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament any longer, he would likely lose the vote. In that scenario, Germany\u2019s president could dissolve parliament within 21 days and an early election could then be held as soon as January.",
      "\u201cDuring these 21 days, we will have enough time to find out whether there are any issues that we may have to decide on together,\u201d Merz said, offering his party\u2019s cooperation with the minority government. \u201cWe are, of course, prepared to hold talks (..) we are also prepared to take responsibility for our country.\u201d",
      "Indeed, pushing through new legislation and plugging the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget won\u2019t become easier for Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens as their government no longer has a majority in parliament. But Scholz has said his government needed that time to pass important legislation.",
      "Achim Wambach from the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research cast doubt that a prolonged period with a minority government would help Germany\u2019s economy get back on track.",
      "\u201cGermany\u2019s problems are too big to tolerate political gridlock,\u201d the analyst said.",
      "\u201cThe government set out to reconcile the transformation towards climate neutrality with economic growth and social security,\u201d the analyst said in a statement. \u201cIt has not lived up to this claim. The economy is stagnating and investments are failing to materialize.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis daunting task was compounded by geo-economic tensions: wars in Europe and the Middle East as well as economically damaging interventions through tariffs and national subsidy policies,\u201d he added. \u201c\u00a0The election of Donald Trump\u00a0has exacerbated these problems. Europe must do more for its security and will have to reckon with increased tariffs.\u201d",
      "The collapse of the coalition came after weeks of disputes\u00a0among the coalition partners\u00a0over ways to boost the country\u2019s ailing economy.",
      "Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democrats had rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens wanted to see major state investment and rejected the Free Democrats\u2019 proposals to cut welfare programs."

      "Weeks after sticky black balls washed up on the famed beaches of Sydney, scientists say they have partly solved the mystery behind the \u201cdisgusting\u201d blobs.",
      "Initially thought to be tar balls, the golf-ball-size debris turned out to be something much different \u2014 a combination of decomposed cooking oils, hair and food waste, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority said Wednesday.",
      "The investigation, carried out by the Australian government and scientists from the University of New South Wales, revealed that the black balls \u201clikely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\u201d the EPA said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAuthorities have considered several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\u201d it said.",
      "The exact origin is yet to be confirmed because of the \u201ccomplex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut final results are due in the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Thousands of the dark balls were discovered starting in mid-October on multiple Sydney beaches, including the famous Bondi Beach, leading to beach closures across the city\u2019s shores.",
      "At the time, authorities advised the public not to swim near or touch the debris. They said preliminary test results indicated that the blobs were tar balls formed when oil comes into contact with debris and water.",
      "However, further investigation has disproven that theory.",
      "\u201cWhat we found is much more \u2014 this is not going to sound very scientific \u2014 but much more disgusting than we previously thought,\u201d said William Alexander Donald, a chemistry professor at the\u00a0University of New South Wales Sydney, who is part of the research team.",
      "While initial testing suggested that the blobs had formed from crude oil or natural oil seeps from the ocean floor, further analysis revealed plenty of \u201cfatty, oily, greasy\u201d molecules typical of spent cooking oil and soap scum, as well as traces of recreational drugs and birth control medication, Donald told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the testing, these balls smell worse than anything you\u2019ve ever \u2014 at least for me \u2014 worse than anything I\u2019ve ever smelled before,\u201d Donald said, with all the signs pointing toward human waste that could \u201cclog up the sewage pipes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a hugely complex analytical challenge where we\u2019ve detected hundreds of different molecules and components in these blobs,\u201d he said.",
      "It would be interesting to follow up on how often such debris occurs and whether scientists can trace it to the exact source, Donald said, noting that his team has received a few unconfirmed reports of similar debris washing up in the past in similar areas and even in the southeastern\u00a0state of Victoria.",
      "Sydney Water confirmed there were no issues at the Bondi or Malabar water facilities, while Transport for NSW Maritime reviewed recent weather patterns but found no clear answers, according to the statement."

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The Australian government will legislate for a ban on social media for children under 16, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday, in what it calls a world-leading package of measures that could become law late next year.",

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a 14-year-old kid getting this stuff, at a time where you\u2019re going through life\u2019s changes and maturing, it can be a really difficult time, and what we\u2019re doing is listening and then acting,\u201d he said.",
      "A number of countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, though Australia\u2019s policy is one of the most stringent.",
      "No jurisdiction so far has tried using age-verification methods such as biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, two of the methods being trialed.",
      "Australia\u2019s other world-first proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts.",
      "Legislation will be introduced in the Australian Parliament this year, with the laws coming into effect 12 months after being ratified by lawmakers, Albanese said.",
      "The opposition Liberal Party has expressed support for a ban.",

      "TikTok declined to comment, while Meta, Alphabet and X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group, a representative body that includes Meta, TikTok, X and Alphabet\u2019s Google as members, said the measure could encourage young people to explore darker, unregulated parts of the internet while cutting their access to support networks.",
      "\u201cKeeping young people safe online is a top priority ... but the proposed ban for teenagers to access digital platforms is a 20th-century response to 21st-century challenges,\u201d said DIGI Managing Director Sunita Bose.",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d she added.",
      "Last year, France proposed a ban on social media for those under 15, though users were able to avoid the ban with parental consent.",
      "For decades, the United States has required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13, leading to most social media platforms banning those under that age from accessing their services."

      "HAVANA \u2014 Cuba\u2019s national electrical grid collapsed on Wednesday as Hurricane Rafael slammed into the island\u2019s southwest shore, packing sustained winds of 115 mph and wreaking havoc on the already crisis-stricken country.",
      "The hurricane was churning about 60 miles west of Cuba\u2019s capital Havana on Wednesday night, after lashing the capital city of nearly two million people with driving rain and violent wind gusts.",
      "The Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned of a \u201clife-threatening storm surge, damaging hurricane-force winds and flash flooding\u201d across much of western Cuba. The region, including Havana, remained under a hurricane warning.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run grid operator UNE said the high winds had caused the country\u2019s electrical system to collapse. State-run television reported the entire population of 10 million people was without electricity \u2014 at least the second such incident in less than a month on the island.",
      "Conditions had deteriorated quickly by mid-afternoon in Havana, east of the storm\u2019s predicted track, and wind and rain had already downed trees and powerlines on city streets.",
      "The capital of 2 million residents is especially vulnerable to a hurricane strike and flooding, with antiquated, densely packed housing and decrepit infrastructure.",
      "Police cruisers with loudspeakers began circling central neighborhoods encouraging people to shelter in place ahead of the storm.",
      "Schools and public transportation in the city were suspended until further notice, and authorities grounded flights at both Havana\u2019s Jose Marti International Airport as well as at the popular beach resort at Varadero through Thursday.",
      "Officials said they had evacuated more than 100 Canadian tourists from Cayo Largo, another popular beach destination off southwestern Cuba.",
      "The farm provinces of Artemisa and Pinar del Rio \u2014 home to the prized tobacco used in Cuba\u2019s famous hand-rolled cigars \u2014 were expected to take a near direct hit as Rafael made landfall on the Caribbean island. Farmers had moved to protect 8,000 metric tonnes of tobacco in the area, Agriculture Minister Ydael P\u00e9rez Brito said, as well as ripening fruits and vegetables.",
      "The timing could not be worse for the Communist-run island, which just last month suffered another total collapse of its\u00a0national electric grid, leaving the country without power for several days.",
      "Hurricane Oscar\u00a0made landfall in far eastern Cuba around the same time as the blackout, throwing a one-two punch that has sapped precious resources in a country suffering from severe\u00a0shortages of food, fuel and medicine.",
      "Cuba\u2019s oil-fired power plants, already obsolete and struggling to keep the lights on, reached a full crisis this year as oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico dwindled.",
      "The hurricane is the latest blow to the country\u2019s already precarious grid and infrastructure.",
      "Rafael grazed the Cayman Islands as a Category 1 hurricane overnight before increasing in less than 24 hours to a much more powerful Category 3 storm off Cuba\u2019s southwestern shore.",
      "Forecasters predict Rafael will spin off towards the western Gulf of Mexico later this week, though the track remains uncertain, the hurricane center said."
