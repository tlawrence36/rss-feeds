      "\u201cThe foundation of the music industry exists because songwriters compose great songs,\" Songwriters Hall of Fame chairman Nile Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cWithout them, there is no recorded music, no concert business, no fans, or merchandising; it all starts with the song and the songwriter.\"",
      "Last year's inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song.",

      "As many in the entertainment industry navigate the devastating effects of the California wildfires, some will soon be decamping to cleaner air in the mountains. The annual Sundance Film Festival begins Thursday in Park City, Utah.",
      "The 41st edition of Robert Redford\u2019s brainchild will, as always, be a year of discovery and discussion. There are timely films:",
      "\u2014 \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d which will premiere just days after former President Joe Biden commuted the sentence of the Indigenous activist nearly half a century after he was imprisoned for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "\u2014 Oscar-winner Mstyslav Chernov\u2019s\u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and Frontline about an attempt to liberate an occupied territory in Ukraine",
      "\u2014 Several films about trans rights including \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about civil rights lawyer Chase Strangio. It's a topic even more pressing after President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "There are even some controversies brewing: \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d from documentary filmmaker Bao Nguyen, calls into question who took the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cNapalm Girl\u201d photograph. Retired AP photographer Nick Ut and the AP, which conducted a six-month investigation into the allegation, are contesting it vigorously and lawyers have asked for it to be pulled from the program.",
      "\u201cThe film is an investigation,\u201d said Eugene Hernandez, the director of the festival, who is moving forward with plans to screen it. \u201cI think it will be a really important conversation that will come out over the next few days after the film is seen by more people.\u201d",
      "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all heavy. There\u2019s drama of course, even a film about starting over after a fire (\u201cRebuilding,\u201d with Josh O\u2019Connor), horror, satire, literary adaptations, comedy, documentaries about famous faces, and some that simply defy categorization.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some really funny stuff in the program,\u201d Hernandez said. One of those Hernandez cited is \u201cBubble & Squeak,\u201d about a married couple accused of smuggling cabbages into a nation where they\u2019re banned.",
      "For first time filmmakers, Sundance can be their chance to break through in a big way. That happened last year for \u201cD\u00ecdi\u201d filmmaker Sean Wang. Some films that debuted last January are still in the awards conversation, like \u201cA Real Pain\u201d and \u201cA Different Man.\u201d For actors, the festival is both a casual respite to awards season glitz (snow boots are more likely on red carpets than high heels) and can be a chance to show audiences a new dimension of their talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strong year of renewal for our artist community,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of really great voices and stories that we get to unveil in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know:",
      "Sundance runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2. There are about 90 features premiering across the 11 days, with screenings starting early in the morning through midnight. Award-winners will be announced on Jan. 31.",
      "Stars with films premiering include Jennifer Lopez, Benedict Cumberbatch, Diego Luna, Conan O\u2019Brien, Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Ayo Edebiri, Olivia Colman, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Steven Yeun, Mark Ruffalo, Bowen Yang, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Lily Gladstone, Dev Patel, Emily Watson, John Lithgow, Marlee Matlin, John Malkovich, Rose Byrne, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Josh O\u2019Connor, Ben Whishaw, Dylan O\u2019Brien, Lili Reinhart and Willem Dafoe.",
      "One of the greatest things about Sundance is that it\u2019s often the under-the-radar movies that become the breakouts.",
      "But some of the higher-profile premieres going into the festival include: Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider-Woman,\u201d starring Lopez; Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson\u2019s documentary \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius)\u201d; \u201cOpus,\u201d a horror about the cult of celebrity with Edebiri and John Malkovich; Andrew Ahn\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d with Bowen Yang and Kelly Marie Tran; the war satire \u201cAtropia,\u201d with Alia Shawkat; \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d about the late Paul Reubens; \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d; and Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman\u2019s doc \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about a cover-up in one of America\u2019s most notorious prison systems.",
      "Festival organizers have been in dialogue with filmmakers, staff, audiences and donors about the effects of the fires, supporting and accommodating where possible including pushing back deadlines to allow filmmakers more time to finish. The festival will also have a QR code displayed before screenings for information on sharing resources or contributing to relief efforts.",
      "\u201cAs hard as the last week has been, this will be a moment to come together,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe community\u2019s really responding to support those who need it most right now. I think that\u2019s going to be a profound aspect of this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "For the most part, yes. Starting in 2027 the festival will no longer be primarily based in Park City. It may stay in Utah but would operate mainly out of Salt Lake City. Other finalists are Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Sundance Institute is expected to announce its final decision in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "\u201cPark City as the home of Sundance is such a special place,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI look at it optimistically because we have two more exciting years in this current configuration. I think we\u2019re going to make the most of those two years and make them as memorable and meaningful as we can.\u201d",
      "Access to the movies premiering at Sundance doesn\u2019t necessary require an expensive trip to Park City anymore. The festival has fully embraced an online component for many of their films.",
      "What started as a necessary COVID-19 adjustment has become a vital part of the program. From Jan. 30 through Feb. 2, audiences can stream much of the program online. Prices start at $35 for a single film ticket and go up to $800 for unlimited access.",
      "Otherwise, films that secure distribution can take anywhere from a few weeks to over a year to hit theaters or streaming services. Steven Soderbergh's \u201cPresence,\u201d which premiered last January, is just hitting theaters this week.",

      "The Nielsen Company said Tuesday that viewership was down from Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration, which reached 33.8 million, and Trump's first move into the White House, seen by 30.6 million in 2017.",
      "Inauguration viewership has varied widely over the past half-century, from a high of 41.8 million when Ronald Reagan came into office in 1981 to a low of 15.5 million for the start of George W. Bush's second term in 2004.",
      "The length of Trump's inauguration coverage may have hurt him in bragging rights. The 24.6 million figure represents the average number of people tuning in to coverage on one of 15 networks between 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern. In past years, the coverage didn't go on for so long, which meant the averages were likely higher because people tune away as the day goes on.",
      "Nielsen had no immediate estimate, for example, of how many people watched Trump up until 4 p.m. Eastern, the cutoff point for most inauguration coverage in the past.",
      "There's no doubt where most viewers gravitated on Monday: Fox News Channel had 10.3 million viewers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., when Trump was sworn in and gave his inaugural speech. In that same period, ABC had 4.7 million viewers, NBC had 4.4 million, CBS had 4.1 million, CNN had 1.7 million and MSNBC had 848,000, Nielsen said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two years after her shocking decision to resign as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is set to publish a memoir.",
      "Crown, a division of Penguin Random House, announced Tuesday that Ardern's \u201cA Different Kind of Power\" is scheduled for June 3. Only 37 when elected in 2017, Ardern will reflect on some of the decisions and events that made her known worldwide. She was widely praised for her compassionate response to the 2019 terrorist attacks against two mosques in Christchurch and for her initial handing of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cSome people thought kindness was sentimental, soft. A bit naive, even. I knew this. But I also knew they were wrong,\" Ardern said in a statement. \"Kindness has a power and strength that almost nothing else on this planet has. I\u2019d seen kindness do extraordinary things \u2014 I\u2019d seen it give people hope, I\u2019d seen it change minds, and transform live. Kindness. This was my guiding principle, and it would be the trait with which I would try to lead, no matter what lay ahead.\u201d",
      "By early 2023, the coronavirus was spreading, and resistance was growing to her zero-tolerance policy of mandates and other restrictions which had helped keep the pandemic out of New Zealand. With her popularity fading, Ardern stunned many supporters by deciding to leave, saying she no longer had \u201cenough in the tank.\u201d In June 2023, she was made a Dame Grand Companion, the second-highest honor in New Zealand, as part of King Charles III\u2019s Birthday Honors. Around the same time, Ardern posted on Instagram that she was working on a book, one more focused on leadership than on \u201cinternal politics.\u201d",
      "Crown is calling her book a \u201cdeeply personal and inspiring memoir\u201d that offers \u201cArdern\u2019s unfiltered journey, from tenacious girl in small-town New Zealand to a trailblazing world leader who became the world\u2019s youngest female head of government, and only the second in history to give birth while in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cArdern changed the world\u2019s expectations of what a global leader can be. With remarkable candor, she shares the pivotal moments that defined her leadership and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the details behind her decision to step down during her sixth year as Prime Minister,\" Crown announced."

Attorney Carl Arnold said the indictment against his 61-year-old client is an \u201cegregious\u201d violation of his constitutional rights because of a 27-year delay in prosecution.",
      "Arnold said after the hearing that they will decide in the coming days if they will appeal the judge\u2019s decision to the state Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors said Davis has provided no proof that he was granted immunity by authorities who interviewed him in 1998 and in the early 2000s while he was still living in California.",
      "Davis\u2019 trial in Las Vegas is currently scheduled for March 17. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder.",
      "Prosecutors have said the evidence against Davis is strong, including his own accounts of the 1996 shooting in his tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the shooting near the Las Vegas Strip that killed Shakur shortly after a brawl at a casino involving Shakur and Davis\u2019 nephew, Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson.",
      "Davis is originally from Compton, California. He was arrested in September 2023 in his neighborhood near Las Vegas.",
      "In interviews and his 2019 memoir that described his life as a leader of a Crips gang sect in Compton, Davis said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson in the back seat of a car from which, he and authorities said, shots were fired at Shakur in another car.",
      "Shakur died a week later. He was 25.",
      "Anderson, who died in 1998 in a shooting in Compton, had denied involvement in Shakur\u2019s killing. Two other men in the car with Anderson and Davis are also dead."

    "story": [
      "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in, which stood in stark contrast to someone like Barack Obama, whose second inaugural ceremony had performances from Beyonc\u00e9, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson and a series of starry onlookers.",
      "There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump\u2019s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.",
      "Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.",
      "\u201cThe people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.\u201d",
      "Even some who have publicly criticized Trump in the past seem to have changed course. One of the highest-profile examples is the rapper Snoop Dogg, who in a 2017 music video pretended to shoot a Trump lookalike, and then this weekend performed at a pre-Inaugural event called The Crypto Ball. When a social media user posted a video of his performance, his name quickly became a trending topic on social media with a fair amount of disbelief and outrage.",
      "There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification for their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.",
      "Also, Thompson said, \u201cthe idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.\u201d",
      "The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone\u2019s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood\u2019s songs from their playlists.",
      "Where Trump once emphasized the otherness of a Hollywood that largely shunned him, he\u2019s now turned his attention back to the entertainment capital as a project to be saved. He named Stallone, Voight and Mel Gibson as his chosen \u201cambassadors\u201d for the mission. Thompson said it sounds like an Onion headline or something on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d That, or a logline for the latest installment in the \u201cExpendables\u201d franchise.",
      "Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017, when nationwide marches brought out the likes of Cher, Madonna, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys and Janelle Monae. The People\u2019s March in D.C. on Saturday did not boast about any celebrity participants. At the Golden Globe Awards in early January, Trump\u2019s name was not mentioned on stage -\u2013 a stark contrast to 2017, when Meryl Streep used her lifetime achievement award speech to decry the president-elect before his first term began.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gone through these processes, and it turned out that none of it ever made any bit of difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll of this celebrity talking against Trump and all of the celebrities going for (Joe) Biden and speaking about the future of democracy not only didn\u2019t make any difference toward the outcome of the election, but one could argue that it actually meant that things moved in the other direction.\u201d",
      "On Friday night in D.C., the nonpartisan nonprofit The Creative Coalition brought together some actors to raise money for and celebrate organizations that support military service members and their families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of things that are nonpartisan, nonpolitical,\u201d said comedian Jeff Ross. \u201cI talk smack for a living and I\u2019m a big believer in free speech. The military protects my right.\u201d",
      "The entertainers stayed largely focused on the event at hand, not the incoming administration, although they did express concern about funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.",
      "\u201cThe NEA has always been in peril, regardless of what administration comes in. But it feels like the incoming administration will probably be more aggressive in cutting down funding for the arts,\u201d said actor Steven Weber. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s an essential component not only in our education, but in the life blood of this culture.\u201d",
      "One Monday event will have a bit of celebrity counterprogramming \u2014 the Concert for America, not as protest but as fundraiser for wildfire relief which will be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles and livestreamed to the world. Participants include Jon Cryer, Lisa Joyner, Conan O\u2019Brien, Julie Bowen, Adam Scott, Wayne Brady and Rosie Perez. In addition to performances and comedy, it will also highlight organizations dedicated to protecting human rights.",
      "Producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson started the event in 2017, also held on Inauguration Day, to raise money for organizations and non-profits they thought would need help over the next four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only to give people a call to action, but also to give them hope, inspiration and to feel connected,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "They didn\u2019t have trouble recruiting entertainers to participate, Jackson said. The only ones who declined did so because they were working.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a counter effort,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cI see it as a way to get rid of the annoying rhetoric and the hate that\u2019s based on nothing. It\u2019s about unity.\u201d"

      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

    "story": [
      "A$AP Rocky is about to go to trial on charges that he fired a gun at a former friend outside a Hollywood hotel in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky is at a crossroads. He could soar to new heights of celebrity in 2025, or be brought back to earth quickly by a trial starting Tuesday that could led to his imprisonment for years.",
      "The hip-hop star, and longtime partner to Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons, is set to touch the highest levels of high fashion as one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May along with Pharrell Williams, LeBron James and others.",
      "And his modest acting career will get a major boost from starring alongside Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\" planned for a summer release.",
      "But at the Los Angeles trial that's expected to last about three weeks, he is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He's accused of firing on a former friend on the streets near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. If convicted, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The 36-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney says he committed no crime.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said after a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s waiting over Rocky\u2019s head and Rihanna and their family\u2019s heads for a while. We\u2019re anxious to get this thing underway and get this behind him.\u201d",
      "The trial has its roots in high school in New York, when the Harlem-raised Rakim Mayers, now known as A$AP Rocky, met Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, who will be the trial's most important witness.",
      "Ephron testified at a 2023 preliminary hearing that he brought Rocky into a crew of young creators who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for \u201cAlways Strive and Prosper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had dreams, pretty much,\u201d Ephron said.",
      "He testified that the members remained close even as Rocky became rich and famous, but the relationships would eventually erode.",
      "The feud came to a head in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, when according to Ephron, Rocky fired at him three or four times, the shots grazing his knuckles.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later, and brought shell casings he had picked up himself \u2014 both points the defense will seize on.",
      "\u201cYou need nothing more than Mr. Ephron\u2019s testimony by itself,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec, the case's lead prosecutor, told a judge at the 2023 hearing,",
      "The trial is full of large personalities, along with two huge names that will loom over the proceedings despite having no direct role: President-elect Donald Trump and Rihanna.",
      "The trial begins the day after the second inauguration of Trump, whom Tacopina represented in the defamation and sexual abuse lawsuit of writer E. Jean Carroll. And Rocky himself became an unlikely cause celebre for then-President Trump during his first term when Trump publicly declared he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was jailed after a brawl in Sweden in 2019.",
      "But Trump has no power over these proceedings, and could not pardon Rocky if he's convicted.",
      "Those anticipating the trial have long been asking whether Rihanna may attend.",
      "\u201cThe mother of his children is she going to be here?\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold asked the defense at an October hearing. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to be here whenever she wants I\u2019d just like to know.\u201d",
      "Tacopina has been unable to give a definitive answer, but has said that he does not expect it.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Rihanna and doesn\u2019t want her anywhere near this proceeding,\" he said after Wednesday's hearing. \"But that\u2019s a family decision they\u2019ll make.\u201d",
      "Tacopina said he has no intention of bringing Rihanna's name up at trial, but Arnold suggested he may when screening jurors.",
      "The judge, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, has an affable but no-nonsense style and dispenses with many court formalities. He said he will keep the juror selection process simple, and a jury should be seated quickly.",
      "In an uncommon move in LA County courts, he will allow cameras in court for nearly the entire trial.",
      "\u201cI believe that the public deserves to see what goes on in the courtroom,\u201d he said.",
      "Tacopina has also represented other hip-hop figures, including Meek Mill and YG. The lawyer who normally practices in New York is gregarious, quick with a joke and always happy to talk to the media, but can be ruthless in cross-examination.",
      "When discussing Ephron's minor injuries at the 2023 hearing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he survived that shooting\u201d and was admonished for his tone.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate scion Robert Durst, was a late addition to the prosecution team. He's also known for his aggressive cross-examination, including a relentless, weeks-long questioning of Durst.",
      "The case against Rocky will largely depend on how credible the jurors find Ephron.",
      "Police officers who searched the Hollywood sidewalk after a report of shots fired found no shell casings. Police recovered no fingerprints from the 9 mm casings Ephron brought them, and no 9 mm pistol was found when a search warrant was served on Rocky.",
      "Surveillance video captured parts of the incident. Prosecutors at the 2023 hearing showed a video still with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Tacopina said he has not decided whether Rocky will testify, which he is legally allowed to avoid.",
      "\u201cHe is eager to tell his story, he would love the opportunity to do so,\u201d the lawyer said Wednesday. \u201cHe is very articulate and very intelligent, he\u2019s a good human being, that would come out if he testifies, but that decision has not been made yet. It depends on how the case goes.\u201d"

      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl in three weeks as a television analyst, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports",
      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl as a television analyst in three weeks, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager understands the spotlight Brady and the network are under. Still, Zager said Brady is in it for the long haul.",
      "\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you,\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s comments by Zager are the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "On Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d",
      "Yee did not return an email or text message by The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Fox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Everything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.",
      "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders' head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.",
      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor and director Justin Baldoni has sued his co-star Blake Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, for defamation and extortion on Thursday in the latest move in a bitter legal battle surrounding the dark romantic drama.",
      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year\u2019s are comparable to battlefield injuries",
      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

      "The U.S. Justice Department says Alabama is unnecessarily institutionalizing children with physical disabilities in nursing homes and hospitals",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama children with physical disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday, warning it would file suit against the state unless changes are made to allow more of these children to live at home.",
      "A Justice Department investigation found Alabama is violating the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act to administer services to individuals with disabilities in the setting most appropriate to the person\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cMany children with physical disabilities in Alabama are unnecessarily institutionalized or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote to state officials.",
      "Clarke announced the probe's findings in a letter to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama Department of Senior Services. It listed changes the state should make to provide more community services and threatened a federal lawsuit if action isn't taken.",
      "Alabama\u2019s Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s office referred questions to the state agencies. The Department of Human Resources did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.",
      "The federal investigation found that Alabama policies effectively limit community-based services, or long-term support services, which allow children with physical disabilities to live at home.",
      "Federal officials said the state has not adequately developed its community-based workforce. The Justice Department also said Alabama fails to support foster parents who care for, or are considering caring for, children with physical disabilities.",
      "Alabama parents too often face a difficult choice of sending their children to nursing homes for life or quitting their jobs to become full-time caregivers, the Justice Department wrote.",
      "\u201cSome children who could otherwise be cared for in family homes have spent their formative years growing up in nursing homes, separated from their families and communities. Others live on the brink of such institutionalization, as their families struggle physically, financially, and emotionally to keep them at home,\u201d Clarke wrote.",
      "P.J. Alexander said he and his wife were one of those Alabama families. Their son Kyle was born with a complex set of medical issues, including genetic conditions and cerebral palsy.",
      "\u201cWe were able to keep him at home, just barely,\u201d he said.",

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Police in Greece say a marble statue of a woman believed to be more than 2,000 years old has been found abandoned in a garbage bag and handed to archaeologists",
      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- A marble statue of a woman believed to be more than 2,000 years old was found abandoned in a garbage bag near the Greek city of Thessaloniki, police said Wednesday.",
      "A resident discovered the 80-centimeter (31-inch) headless statue beside a trash bin in Neoi Epivates, outside Greece\u2019s second-largest city. The man turned it over to local authorities, who contacted archaeologists to assess its significance.",
      "Police said experts, following an initial evaluation, determined the piece dates to the Hellenistic era, a period roughly between 320 and 30 B.C. that was marked by a flourishing of art and culture following the conquests of Alexander the Great.",
      "The statue was sent for further examination by archaeologists. It will ultimately be handed over to the local antiquities authority for preservation and study. Police opened an investigation to determine who discarded the statue and briefly detained a man for questioning who was later released without charge. Accidental archaeological discoveries are relatively common in Greece, a country renowned for its ancient heritage, and often made during building construction or public works. In December, workers installing natural gas pipelines near Athens uncovered a Roman-era statue of Hermes buried upright in a brick-lined pit near the Acropolis. Thessaloniki weeks ago unveiled a trove of antiquities found during the decades-long construction of its metro system, which officially opened in November. Key finds, including a marble-paved Roman thoroughfare and tens of thousands of artifacts spanning the Greek, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, are now showcased at subway stations.",

      "Italian opposition lawmakers and human rights groups are voicing outrage after Italy released a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
      "ROME -- Italian opposition lawmakers and human rights groups voiced outrage Wednesday after Italy released a Libyan warlord on a technicality, after he was arrested on a warrant from the International Criminal Court accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Justice Minister Carlo Nordio was grilled about the release Tuesday of Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, during a previously scheduled appearance before the Senate. Nordio didn\u2019t respond to several requests for details about the release or demands that he reaffirm Italy\u2019s commitment to upholding international justice.",
      "Al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force. The ICC warrant, dated Jan. 18 and referenced in Italian court papers, accuses him of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2011, punishable with life in prison.",
      "Al-Masri was arrested Sunday in Turin, where he reportedly had attended the Juventus-Milan soccer match the night before.",
      "Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered him freed Tuesday, and he was sent back to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services, because of what the appeals court said was a procedural error in his arrest. The ruling said Nordio should have been informed ahead of time of the arrest, since the justice ministry handles all relations with The Hague-based court.",
      "Al-Masri returned to Tripoli late Tuesday. He was received at the Mitiga airport by supporters who celebrated his release, according to local media. Footage circulated online showed dozens of young men chanting and carrying what appeared to be al-Masri on their shoulders at the airport.",
      "Opposition lawmakers from several parties voiced outrage and demanded clarity, with former Premier Matteo Renzi accusing the right-wing government of hypocrisy given its stated crackdown on human traffickers.",
      "\u201cBut when a trafficker whom the International Criminal Court tells us is a dangerous criminal lands on your table, it\u2019s not like you chase him down, you brought him home to Libya with a plane of the Italian secret services,\u201d said Renzi of the Italia Viva party. \u201cEither you\u2019re sick or this is the image of a hypocritical, indecent government.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party demanded Premier Giorgia Meloni respond specifically to parliament about the case, saying it raised \u201cgrave questions\u201d given the known abuses in Libyan prisons for which Al-Masri is accused.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy\u2019s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving.",
      "Human rights groups have documented gross abuses in the Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept, and have accused Italy of being complicit in their mistreatment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to understand why al-Masri was in Italy and why he was freed with such urgency despite the international arrest warrant,\u201d said the Democratic lawmaker Paolo Ciani. He said the choice \u201cappeared to be political.\"",
      "Another senator noted that the plane sent to retrieve al-Masri was sent to Turin before the Rome appeals court had even ruled, suggesting the decision to send him home had been already made by Meloni's office, which is responsible for the Italian secret services.",
      "Two humanitarian groups, Mediterranea Saving Humans and Refugees in Libya, which have documented abuses committed against migrants in Libyan detention facilities, said they were incredulous that Italy let al-Masri go.",
      "\u201cThose of us who managed to survive had believed that it was really possible not only to get justice, but more importantly to prevent this criminal from still acting undisturbed,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cInstead, in recent days we have witnessed something shameful, unbelievable in how brazenly it has been conducted.\u201d",
      "But Tarik Lamloum, a Libyan activist working with the Belaady Organization for Human Rights which focuses on migrants in Libya, said Italy\u2019s release of al-Masri was expected. He said his release shows the power of militias who control the flow of migrants to Europe through Libya\u2019s shores.",
      "\u201cTripoli militias are able to pressure (Italy) because they control the migrants file,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Militias in western Libya are part of the official state forces tasked with intercepting migrants at sea, including in the EU-trained coast guard. They also run state detention centers, where abuses of migrants are common.",
      "As a result, militias \u2014 some of them led by warlords the U.N. has sanctioned for abuses \u2014 benefit from millions in funds the European Union gives to Libya to stop the migrant flow to Europe.",
      "The ICC prosecutor\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The European Commission spokesman reaffirmed all EU members had pledged to cooperate with the court.",
      "\u201cWe respect the court\u2019s impartiality and we are fully attached to international criminal justice to combat impunity,\" said EU commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni. In a 2023 summit, the EU leaders committed \u201cto cooperate fully with the court, including rapid execution of any pending arrests,\u201d he added.",

      "They didn't serve in Europe but in the fringe battles in Africa, where Allied forces fought in the then-German colonies of German South West Africa (now Namibia) and German East Africa (now Tanzania).",
      "The men made the same ultimate sacrifice as around 10 million others who died serving in armies in the 1914-1918 war.",
      "After the war, they were not recognized because of the racial policies of British colonialism and then South Africa's apartheid regime.",
      "The memorial finally rights a historical wrong, said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the British organization that looks after war graves and built the new memorial in Cape Town's oldest public garden.",

      "\u201cIt ensures the names and stories of those who died will echo in history for future generations,\u201d Princess Anne said. \"It is important to recognize that those we have come to pay tribute to have gone unacknowledged for too long. We will remember them.\u201d",

      "While South Africa has several memorials dedicated to its white soldiers who died in both world wars, the Black servicemen's contribution was ignored for decades.",
      "It was in danger of being lost forever until a researcher found evidence of their service in South African army documents around 10 years ago, said Commonwealth War Graves Commission operational manager David McDonald, who oversaw the South African project.",
      "Researchers discovered the more than 1,700 Black servicemen. It also led the commission to the families of six of the dead, most of them from deeply rural South African regions.",
      "Four of those families were represented at Wednesday's ceremony. They laid wreaths at the foot of the memorial and were able to touch the individual poles dedicated to their lost relatives and where their names are inscribed.",

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels said Wednesday they released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The move by the Iranian-backed Houthis marks their latest effort to de-escalate their attacks following a ceasefire in Gaza. It also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump likely weighs whether to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group that had been revoked by President Joe Biden.",
      "The rebels said they released the sailors after mediation by Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that's long been an interlocutor with the Houthis. Oman did not immediately acknowledge the release, though an Omani Royal Air Force jet took a flight to Yemen earlier Wednesday and took off again about an hour after the Houthi announcement.",
      "The Houthis also said Hamas separately requested the release of the ship's crew of 25, who included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico.",
      "\u201cThis step comes in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza,\u201d the Houthis said in a statement on rebel-controlled SABA news agency.",
      "The Houthi rebels said they hijacked the Galaxy Leader over its connection to Israel. They then had a campaign targeting ships in international waters, which only stopped with the recent ceasefire in Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "A representative for the Galaxy Leader's owners had no immediate comment on Wednesday.",
      "The Bahamas-flagged vessel is affiliated with an Israeli billionaire Abraham \u201cRami\u201d Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel.",
      "The Houthi attack on the Galaxy Leader saw the rebels launched a helicopter-borne raid. Propaganda footage of the raid has been played constantly by the Houthis, who even shot a music video aboard the ship at one point.",
      "On Monday, the Houthis signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip, but warned wider assaults could resume if needed.",
      "However, it likely won\u2019t be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that\u2019s crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.",
      "The release of the vessel's crew now may be an effort to curry favor with the U.S., though the ship still remains moored off the Yemeni port city of Hodeida.",
      "\u201cThis gesture by the Houthis may be intended as a goodwill measure towards the new Trump administration, potentially aiming to delay their designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization,\u201d said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha, of the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels had maintained that they only targeted ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities."

      "Israeli forces, meanwhile, carried out a raid elsewhere in the West Bank that the military said was in response to the hurling of firebombs at Israeli vehicles. It said several suspects were detained for questioning, and a video circulating online appeared to show dozens being marched through the streets.",
      "On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched another major operation, this time in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, where its forces have regularly clashed with Palestinian militants in recent years, even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the war there.",
      "At least nine Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, including a 16-year-old, and 40 were wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The military said its forces carried out airstrikes and dismantled roadside bombs and \u201chit\u201d 10 militants \u2014 though it was not clear what that meant.",
      "Palestinian residents have reported a major increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz cast the Jenin operation as part of Israel's larger struggle against Iran and its militant allies across the region, saying \u201cwe will strike the octopus' arms until they snap.\u201d",
      "The Palestinians view such operations and the expansion of settlements as ways of cementing Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns.",
      "Prominent human rights groups call it a form of apartheid since the over 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have all the rights conferred by Israeli citizenship. Israel rejects those allegations.",
      "Netanyahu has been struggling to quell a rebellion by his ultranationalist coalition partners since agreeing to the ceasefire. The agreement requires Israeli forces to withdraw from most of Gaza and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners \u2014 including militants convicted of murder \u2014 in exchange for hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "One coalition partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, resigned in protest the day the ceasefire went into effect. Another, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire is slated to end in early March.",
      "They want Israel to annex the West Bank and to rebuild settlements in Gaza while encouraging what they refer to as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians.",
      "Netanyahu still has a parliamentary majority after Ben-Gvir's departure, but the loss of Smotrich \u2014 who is also the de facto governor of the West Bank \u2014 would severely weaken his coalition and likely lead to early elections.",
      "That could spell the end of Netanyahu's nearly unbroken 16 years in power, leaving him even more exposed to longstanding corruption charges and an expected public inquiry into Israel's failure to prevent the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Trump's return to the White House offers Netanyahu a potential lifeline.",
      "The newly sworn-in president, who lent unprecedented support to Israel during his previous term, has surrounded himself with aides who support Israeli settlement. Some support the settlers' claim to a biblical right to the West Bank because of the Jewish kingdoms that existed there in antiquity.",
      "The international community overwhelmingly considers settlements illegal.",
      "Among the flurry of executive orders Trump signed on his first day back in office was one rescinding the Biden administration's sanctions on settlers and Jewish extremists accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "The sanctions \u2014 which had little effect \u2014 were one of the few concrete steps the Biden administration took in opposition to the close U.S. ally, even as it provided billions of dollars in military support for Israel's campaign in Gaza, among the deadliest and most destructive in decades.",
      "Trump claimed credit for helping to get the Gaza ceasefire agreement across the finish line in the final days of the Biden presidency.",
      "But this week, Trump said he was \u201cnot confident\u201d it would hold and signaled he would give Israel a free hand in Gaza, saying: \u201cIt's not our war, it's their war.\u201d",

      "The former president had pending sentences in El Salvador for corruption and making deals with the country\u2019s powerful street gangs that amounted to more than 26 years, but he never set foot in prison.",
      "The journalist-turned-politician came to power with the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, the leftist party born of El Salvador\u2019s civil war and a powerful national political force for three decades that was left with no seats in the Congress after last year\u2019s election.",
      "Funes was born in San Salvador on Oct. 18, 1959.

      "Funes was a fresh face, not someone directly involved in the civil war as the party tried to remake itself with a less bellicose image.",
      "At the time, Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Ch\u00e1vez praised Funes as \u201ctenacious\u201d and someone who wouldn\u2019t shy away from El Salvador\u2019s problems.",
      "But by the time he left office, Funes was hounded by accusations of corruption. In 2016, he fled to Nicaragua. He always denied the accusations and said his troubles were all part of political persecution.",
      "But he was tried in absentia six times and convicted in each one.",
      "For one, Funes was sentenced in May 2023 to 14 years in prison for negotiating a truce with the gangs to lower the homicide rate during his administration in exchange for giving imprisoned gang leaders perks.",
      "His last sentence came just last year in June. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for receiving an airplane as a kickback for awarding a construction contract for a bridge project. He was also being prosecuted for allegedly diverting some $351 million in government funds.",
      "A number of former officials in his administration, as well as his ex-wife Vanda Pignato, his children and various former partners have also been prosecuted for corruption. His former security minister, David Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his role in negotiating the gang truce.",

      "In recent years, Funes and current El Salvador President Nayib Bukele frequently sparred on social platforms, trading insults. Bukele pushed prosecutions of the former president, especially for his negotiations with the gangs.",
      "Bukele himself had been accused of but vehemently denied before he crushed the gangs in a yearslong all-out offensive."

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's navy has commissioned a new-generation frigate as competition rises with the U.S. and other regional powers, saying the ship will \u201cplay a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness\" of its forces.",
      "China already has the world's largest navy in terms of number of hulls, although its technology is sometimes seen as lagging. Its largest competitor, the U.S., has warned its Navy could be outnumbered and has called for a building program as well as reforms to put damaged ships into action sooner.",
      "China's People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy operates mainly in waters off the Chinese east coast and in the huge and strategically crucial South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. A key mission also remains backing up the army in any attack on Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy about 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the Chinese coast that Beijing has vowed to annex by force if necessary.",
      "The first Type 054B frigate, christened the Luohe, was commissioned Wednesday in Qingdao, a port city in northern China where the PLAN\u2019s northern fleet is based.",
      "The ship has a displacement of approximately 5,000 tons and includes stealth technology, combat command systems and firepower integration, \u201csignificantly enhancing overall performance,\u201d the navy said.",
      "\u201cWith strong capabilities for comprehensive combat operations and diverse military missions, the warship will play a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness of naval task forces,\u201d it added.",
      "The Luohe's armaments include a variety of machine guns for close combat and anti-air and anti-ship missiles, according to defense publications, some of which say the ship could become the backbone of the Chinese navy.",
      "The statement said nothing about future 054Bs, but at least two more are believed to have been launched and another is under construction. China has around 234 warships compared to the U.S. Navy\u2019s 219, including around 50 frigates and the same number of destroyers. China has two operating aircraft carriers and another undergoing sea trials, along with a massive and powerful coast guard.",
      "Recent wargames have shown China would lose many more vessels in a simulated clash with the U.S., but would be able to absorb the losses and continue fighting.",
      "The PLAN has also sent ships further abroad including the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean in its attempts to use its navy as an extension of its growing economic and diplomatic clout. PLAN and Chinese coast guard ships have also patrolled in the East China Sea, where China claims a group of uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. While planes and ships from both sides have come into contact, no shots have been fired during such incidents.",
      "The U.S. and other nations have deliberately sailed close to islands, some of them human-made, to challenge China's claim to them. Beijing has ignored a U.N.-backed court's ruling that threw out most of China's territorial claims.",

      "KARTALKAYA, Turkey -- KARTALKAYA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 As flames tore through a 12-story hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey, friends Esra Karakisa and Halime Cetin stood helpless as the horror unfolded before them, with people leaning out of smoke-filled rooms pleading for help and others making the harrowing decision to jump.",
      "The fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel, in Kartalya, in the Koroglu mountains, in Bolu province, on Tuesday left at least 76 people dead and 51 injured. It came near the start of a two-week winter break for schools when hotels in the region are filled to capacity.",
      "\u201cThere was no one around. They were calling for firefighters. They were breaking the windows. Some could no longer stand the smoke and flames, and they jumped,\u201d Cetin, an employee at a hotel adjacent to the Grand Kartal, told The Associated Press.",
      "Karakisa said: \u201cIt was awful. We were terrified. People were screaming. The cries of children especially affected us. We wanted to help but there was nothing we could do. I couldn\u2019t look it was so terrifying.\u201d",
      "Authorities have assigned six prosecutors to investigate the cause of the fire, which appeared to have started at the restaurant section on the fourth floor of the wooden-clad hotel and spread quickly through to the upper floors. At least nine people have been detained for questioning, including the hotel owner.",
      "Flags at government buildings and Turkish diplomatic missions abroad were lowered to half-staff as the nation shocked by the disaster observed a day of mourning for the victims.",

Vedat's twin brother, Sedat, is also believed to have died, but his body has not been identified yet, the private DHA news agency reported.",
      "The hotel had 238 registered guests, according to Yerlikaya. The fire was reported at 3:27 a.m. local time and the fire department began to respond at 4:15 a.m., he told reporters.",

      "DUBLIN -- Veteran politician Miche\u00e1l Martin is set to become Ireland's prime minister for a second time on Wednesday when lawmakers formally approve him as head of a coalition government.",
      "The confirmation comes almost two months after an election in which Martin\u2019s Fianna F\u00e1il party won the most seats, but not enough to govern alone.",
      "After weeks of talks, the long-dominant center-right parties Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael agreed to form a coalition with the support of several independent lawmakers.",
      "Under the deal, Martin. 64, will be taoiseach, or prime minister, for three years, with Fine Gael\u2019s Simon Harris \u2013 the outgoing taoiseach \u2013 as his deputy. The two politicians will then swap jobs for the rest of the five-year term.",
      "Members of both parties have ratified the government agreement, and Matin is set to be confirmed by members of the D\u00e1il, parliament\u2019s lower house, on Wednesday. He will then be formally appointed to the job by President Michael D. Higgins before appointing his Cabinet.",
      "In Ireland\u2019s Nov. 29 election, voters bucked a global trend that saw incumbent governments ousted around the world in 2024. Fianna Fail won 48 of the 174 legislative seats and Fine Gael 38. They\u2019ve secured backing to govern from the mostly conservative Regional Independent Group, which will be given two ministerial positions.",
      "Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il share broadly similar center-right policies but a century-old rivalry stemming from their origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s civil war in the 1920s. They formed an alliance after the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat.",
      "Their new agreement shuts out left-of-center party Sinn Fein, which will stay in opposition despite winning 39 seats. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have refused to work with them because of their historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "The new government faces huge pressure to ease rising homelessness, driven by soaring rents and property prices, and to better absorb a growing number of asylum-seekers.",
      "The cost of living \u2014 especially Ireland\u2019s acute housing crisis \u2014 was a dominant topic in the election campaign, and immigration has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration.",

      "The change of leadership in Washington on Monday could be an opportunity for China, which has long railed against Biden's strategy of building partnerships with \u201clike-minded countries\u201d aimed at countering its growing influence.",
      "Biden reinvigorated a grouping known as the Quad \u2014 the United States, India, Japan and Australia. China's relations with all three of those U.S. partners are improving, as are its ties with Britain. The durability of Biden\u2019s legacy is now in question. During his first term, Trump didn\u2019t hesitate to challenge traditional U.S. partners.",
      "\u201cIt is possible that Trump may drift away from U.S. allies, making them pay more attention to China\u2019s role and in fact it has provided a chance for China\u2019s diplomacy,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cI think we should grasp the chance.\u201d",
      "But U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said that Trump \u201chas a record of rallying the world toward a more competitive stance with China.\u201d Trump agreed to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy that Japan introduced during his first term and backed excluding Chinese companies from telecom networks in the U.S. and many of its partners.",
      "And on Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 hours after he was sworn in \u2014 met with the foreign ministers of Australia, India and Japan in Washington, a move that suggested engaging the Quad countries and countering China\u2019s influence will remain a priority for Trump.",

      "India turned the page with China on a bitter border dispute last October, but protested when Beijing created two new counties in an area claimed by both nations.",
      "Still, new leaders in Australia, the U.K. and Japan have shown a desire to warm relations with China, the world's largest manufacturer and a source of strategic minerals. The government in Beijing has reciprocated in part because it wants foreign investment to help revive its economy, which could be set back if Trump follows through on a threat to impose higher tariffs.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping told European Council President Antonio Costa in a phone conversation last week that both sides could bring more \u201cstability and certainty\u201d to the turbulent global situation.

      "But unlike Biden, Trump has irked U.S. allies and partners with his recent remarks on possibly annexing Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and making Canada the 51st American state.",
      "Hal Brands, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, said he believes some top strategists in Beijing are \u201csalivating at the damage they think Trump is going to do to U.S. alliances and the opportunities this creates for Beijing to resurrect some of its relationships with other advanced democracies \u2014 Japan and Europe \u2014 that had moved in a very sharply anti-China direction since COVID.\u201d",
      "Trump's rhetoric, and attempts by his adviser Elon Musk to interfere in British and German politics, \u201care certain to have a ripple effect,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington.",
      "\u201cCountries want to at the minimum keep their options open,\" she said. \u201cChina is unlikely to be a better choice than the U.S., even under Trump, but it is important to find some counterbalance.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s relations aren\u2019t improving with every U.S. partner. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has aggressively resisted China\u2019s increasingly assertive stance in their territorial disputes in the South China Sea.",

      "Syria's interim rulers are trying to form a united national army after the fall of Bashar Assad late last year",
      "NAWA, Syria -- As insurgents raced across Syria in a surprise offensive launched in the country's northwest late last year, officials from several countries backing either the rebels or Syria\u2019s government met in Qatar on what to do.",
      "According to people briefed on the Dec. 7 meeting, officials from Turkey, Russia, Iran and a handful of Arab countries agreed that the insurgents would stop their advance in Homs, the last major city north of Damascus, and that internationally mediated talks would take place with Syrian leader Bashar Assad on a political transition.",
      "But insurgent factions from Syria\u2019s south had other plans. They pushed toward the capital, arriving in Damascus\u2019 largest square before dawn. Insurgents from the north, led by the Islamist group Hayyat Tahrir al-Sham, arrived hours later. Assad, meanwhile, had fled.",
      "HTS, the most organized of the groups, has since established itself as Syria\u2019s de facto rulers after coordinating with the southern fighters during the lighting-fast offensive.",
      "Wariness among the southern factions since then, however, has highlighted questions over how the interim administration can bring together a patchwork of former rebel groups, each with their own leaders and ideology.",
      "HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa has called for a unified national army and security forces. The interim defense minister, Murhaf Abu Qasra, has begun meeting with armed groups. But some prominent leaders like southern rebel commander Ahmad al-Awda have refused to attend.",
      "Officials with the interim government did not respond to questions.",
      "The southern province of Daraa is widely seen as the cradle of the Syrian uprising in 2011. When anti-government protests were met with repression by Assad\u2019s security forces, \u201cwe were forced to carry weapons,\u201d said Mahmoud al-Bardan, a rebel leader there.",
      "The rebel groups that formed in the south had different dynamics from those in the north, less Islamist and more localized, said Aron Lund, a fellow with the Century International think tank. They also had different backers.",
      "\u201cIn the north, Turkey and Qatar favored Islamist factions very heavily,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the south, Jordanian and American involvement nudged the insurgency in a different direction.\u201d",
      "In 2018, factions in Daraa reached a Russian-mediated \u201creconciliation agreement\u201d with Assad\u2019s government. Some former fighters left for Idlib, the destination for many from areas recaptured by government forces, while others remained.",
      "The deal left many southern factions alive and armed, Lund said.",
      "\u201cWe only turned over the heavy weapons \u2026 the light weapons remained with us,\u201d al-Bardan said.",
      "When the HTS-led rebel groups based in the north launched their surprise offensive last year in Aleppo, those weapons were put to use again. Factions in the southern provinces of Daraa, Sweida and Quneitra reactivated, forming a joint operations room to coordinate with northern ones.",
      "On Dec. 7, \u201cwe had heard from a number of parties that there might be an agreement that \u2026 no one would enter Damascus so there could be an agreement on the exit of Bashar Assad or a transitional phase,\u201d said Nassim Abu Ara, an official with one of the largest rebel factions in the south, the 8th Brigade of al-Awda.",
      "However, \u201cwe entered Damascus and turned the tables on these agreements,\u201d he said.",
      "Al-Bardan confirmed that account, asserting that the agreement \u201cwas binding on the northern factions\u201d but not the southern ones.",
      "\u201cEven if they had ordered us to stop, we would not have,\u201d he said, reflecting the eagerness among many fighters to remove Assad as soon as possible.",
      "Ammar Kahf, executive director of the Istanbul-based Omran Center for Strategic Studies, who was in Doha on Dec. 7 and was briefed on the meetings, said there was an agreement among countries\u2019 officials that the rebels would stop their offensive in Homs and go to Geneva for negotiations on \u201ctransitional arrangements.\u201d",
      "But Kahf said it was not clear that any Syrian faction, including HTS, agreed to the plan. Representatives of countries at the meeting did not respond to questions.",
      "A statement released by the foreign ministers of Turkey, Russia, Iran, Qatari, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Iraq after the Dec. 7 meeting said they \u201cstressed the need to stop military operations in preparation for launching a comprehensive political process\u201d but did not give specifics.",
      "The initial hours after armed groups' arrival in Damascus were chaotic. Observers said the HTS-led forces tried to re-impose order when they arrived. An Associated Press journalist saw an argument break out when HTS fighters tried to stop members of another faction from taking abandoned army munitions.",
      "Abu Ara acknowledged that \u201cthere was some chaos\u201d but added, \u201cwe have to understand that these people were pent-up and suddenly they achieved the joy of victory in this manner.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:58:27 -0500",
    "summary": "As the future of social media platforms such as TikTok remains unknown, a younger generation of farmers is relying on social media to connect with audiences outside agriculture",
    "story": [
      "As the future of social media platforms such as TikTok remains unknown, a younger generation of farmers is relying on social media to connect with audiences outside agriculture",
      "BUCYRUS, Ohio -- Zoe Kent hopes people get a little joy out of her talking about farming on the Internet. In one of her latest videos, she compares pesticide application to dry shampoo. \u201cFarming is for the girls,\u201d she quips.",
      "On Instagram and TikTok, under the handle \u201cfarmwithzoe,\u201d Kent films herself putting on boots to load corn into a massive truck bed, posts memes about the price of grain and documents just about everything else about farm life from getting rocks stuck in her equipment to eating lunch on long days out in a combine.",
      "Now, the future of TikTok \u2014 and \u201cFarmtok,\u201d as some creators call the ecosystem of farm-related influencers online \u2014 has become more uncertain, thanks to a ban the U.S. government briefly implemented on TikTok over the weekend. That was followed by the new Trump administration rescinding that ban, at least for now, but farmers are all too aware that things could change, and with them, the ways that they share farm life with the rest of the world. But most say they\u2019ll keep adapting to whatever the platforms throw their way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s building your business on rented land, if you will,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s not guaranteed to be there.\u201d",
      "Even before the uncertain threat to TikTok\u2019s future, farm creators had to contend with social media\u2019s evolution. As algorithms changed, they faced greater challenges communicating with a public that many see as increasingly disconnected from agriculture.",
      "But most say they\u2019ll keep adapting to whatever the platforms throw their way. Some producers make extra money by building a following on TikTok or Instagram. Others use social media to advertise to local customers like restaurants or farmers\u2019 markets. Perhaps most importantly, they want to continue to build community with other farmers in the face of industry challenges like the toll of the profession on mental health, economic pressure and climate change.",
      "Multiple farmers said that disconnection has grown over the years as social media algorithms have changed. \u201cI know for a fact our social media reach is greatly diminished now,\u201d said Beth Satterwhite, who has been posting about her small organic vegetable farm in McMinnville, Oregon on Instagram for over a decade now. \u201cOn the ground stories of people working in agriculture are a little less interesting to the consumer \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually less interesting or just less visible,\u201d she said.",
      "Neil Denton, who farms corn, soybeans, wheat and rye in Barlow, Kentucky, shared a similar sentiment. He thinks that many of his over 80,000 followers on Instagram and 33,000 followers on TikTok are fellow producers, not members of the public. He calls that \u201cdisappointing\" and worries about how little people know about the food that ends up on their plates.",
      "But he does think there's a silver lining: \u201cFarming is a lonely occupation because you\u2019re not with a lot of coworkers,\u201d Denton said. \u201cI think some farmers use social media as an outlet...to be able to express yourself and to be able to feel like you\u2019re not lonely.\u201d",
      "Within the farming community, it can also be useful to learn from other farmers, many producers said. Megan Dwyer, who grows corn and soybeans and raises beef cattle in northwest Illinois, uses social media, especially X and Facebook, to gauge what matters to other farmers. \u201cIt's a great source for information, especially rapid information,\u201d she said.",
      "However, all that rapid information does have a price. Satterwhite described a \u201clanguage soup\u201d around agriculture, saying it could be hard for an outsider to tell what farming practices are legitimately better for the climate or environment. \u201cI see a lot of greenwashing,\u201d said Satterwhite, referring to the practice of falsely portraying a product or practice as eco-friendly to market it to an environmentally-conscious audience.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of misinformation out there,\u201d Kent said. \u201cI try to sift out who has genuine questions versus who just already has a stance and they\u2019re not willing to hear me out.\"",
      "That's something many farming influencers agree on \u2014 that they still want a place to have the conversation.",
      "As Dwyer put it: \u201cYou never know who you\u2019re influencing there or or what may happen.\u201d",

      "Every year, the Edmunds Top Rated Awards are bestowed on the best vehicles of the year",
      "Once a year, Edmunds\u2019 car experts gather to decide on the best new vehicles on sale. The annual Edmunds Top Rated Awards are given to the cars, trucks and SUVs that beat out the rest of the competition according to Edmunds\u2019 rigorous vehicle testing program. To win, each vehicle must have been tested at the Edmunds test track and thoroughly evaluated in real-world use as well.",
      "There are six main categories: best car, SUV and truck, and electric versions in the same categories. This year, there are some new champions, while others are repeat winners. The starting prices listed below include destination charges.",
      "The 2025 Honda Civic isn\u2019t just this year\u2019s best car; it might be the best Honda Civic ever. A big reason why is the newly available hybrid powertrain. The EPA estimates that it helps the hybrid versions of the Civic get up to 49 mpg in combined city/highway driving, a stellar result that Edmunds confirmed in its real-world testing. Pleasingly, this doesn\u2019t come at the expense of power; indeed, the hybrid\u2019s acceleration is on par with that of the sporty Civic Si. All Civics also provide ample passenger space and many easy-to-use technology features.",
      "Starting price for a Civic sedan with the hybrid powertrain: $30,100",
      "Tesla made significant updates to its popular Model 3 last year, propelling this electric sedan to the Top Rated podium for 2025. It has affordable pricing, plenty of range, and a more premium and better-assembled cabin than before. It\u2019s well suited for daily commuting as well as longer trips. The Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive version went 338 miles on a single charge in the independent Edmunds EV Range Test. If it\u2019s excitement you\u2019re after, the Performance version easily satisfies with its capability to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in an Edmunds-tested 3.0 seconds.",
      "Starting price: $43,880",
      "Great fuel economy is key to why the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid won the SUV category. The potential to get an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving is what you\u2019d typically expect from a compact sedan. For a three-row SUV, 36 mpg is outstanding. The Grand Highlander Hybrid also has a roomy interior, a smooth ride, and many standard technology and driver assist features. If you\u2019ve got a bigger family and want SUV-based utility to go along with hybrid gas savings, there\u2019s nothing better than the Grand Highlander.",
      "Starting price: $46,830",
      "The Kia EV9 is the Edmunds Top Rated Electric SUV two years in a row. It\u2019s an ideal vehicle for people wanting an EV with more space and utility than most other electric SUVs. It has three roomy rows of seating that you can use to schlep your kids to school or fold down to bring home your haul from Costco. It\u2019s also enjoyable to drive. The dual-motor versions of the EV9 have no problem getting up to highway speeds quickly or passing slow traffic. Other EV9 highlights include plenty of standard features, more than 300 miles of Edmunds-tested range, a long warranty and distinctive styling.",
      "Starting price: $56,395",
      "There are plenty of capable midsize trucks on the market for 2025. But none quite satisfy Edmunds\u2019 editors quite like the 2025 Ford Ranger. It starts off with its standard turbocharged 270-horsepower four-cylinder engine that gives the Ranger quick acceleration and the ability to tow up to 7,500 pounds when properly equipped. When you\u2019re not hauling stuff, the Ranger satisfies with a smooth ride and a quality interior with easy-to-use controls. There\u2019s even a Ranger Raptor version that\u2019s well suited for playing in the dirt.",
      "Starting price: $34,575",
      "The Rivian R1T electric pickup received a major update for 2025, one so extensive it lands at the top of our electric truck list. The exterior has the same styling as before, which stands out from the crowd for all the right reasons. It also retains the sharp handling and brisk acceleration it has always had. But now it has even more range \u2014 357 miles from the dual-motor and Max battery-equipped R1T Edmunds tested \u2014 and an easier-to-use touchscreen interface. Its clever all-wheel-drive system makes it surprisingly capable off-road.",
      "Starting price: $71,700",
      "If you\u2019re researching your next vehicle purchase, be sure to check out the Edmunds Top Rated award winners for 2025. Take a look at the full list of winners and runners-up, and test-drive them yourself to see if you agree with our picks.",

      "If the government fails to meet the target, it must pay a 10 million euro ($10.4 million) fine to Greenpeace.",

      "Although environmental groups had been pushing for nitrogen reductions for years, a ruling by the country\u2019s highest administrative court in 2019 halted building permits after judges concluded exemptions to pollution regulations violated EU rules.",
      "In a country plagued by housing shortages, Rutte\u2019s government scrambled to find solutions to restart construction projects, including reducing the maximum speed limit from 130 kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour) to 100 km/h (62 mph) on many highways.",
      "The agricultural industry became the focus of reduction demands. In 2022 thousands of farmers drove tractors through the streets of The Hague to protest proposals by the previous government to curb emissions. They argued that the agricultural sector was unfairly targeted while other industries contributing to emissions, such as aviation and construction, faced less far-reaching rules.",
      "The success of right-leaning parties in the 2023 elections, including one born out of the protests, was in part because of the backlash to plans to reduce emissions."

      "Alaska's political leaders are cheering an expansive executive order signed by President Donald Trump that aims to boost oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- President Donald Trump's expansive executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska is being cheered by state political leaders who see new fossil fuel development as critical to Alaska's economic future and criticized by environmental groups that see the proposals as worrying in the face of a warming climate.",
      "The order, signed on Trump's first day in office Monday, is consistent with a wish list submitted by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy shortly after Trump's election. It seeks, among other things, to open to oil and gas drilling an area of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge considered sacred to the Indigenous Gwich'in, undo limits imposed by the Biden administration on drilling activity in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the North Slope and reverse restrictions on logging and road-building in a temperate rainforest that provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon.",
      "In many ways, the order seeks to revert to policies that were in place during Trump's first term.",
      "But Trump \u201cjust can't wave a magic wand and make these things happen,\u201d said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Environmental laws and rules must be followed in attempts to unravel existing policies, and legal challenges to Trump's plans are virtually certain, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready and looking forward to the fight of our lives to keep Alaska great, wild and abundant,\u201d Freeman said.",
      "The order seeks to reverse a Biden administration decision canceling seven leases issued as part of the first-ever oil and gas lease sale in the refuge's coastal plain. Major oil companies didn't participate in the sale, held in early 2021 in the waning days of Trump's first term. The leases went to a state corporation. Two small companies that also won leases in that sale had earlier given them up.",
      "Trump's order calls for the Interior secretary to \u201cinitiate additional leasing\u201d and issue all permits and easements necessary for oil and gas exploration and development to occur. Gwich\u2019in leaders oppose drilling on the coastal plain, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and have expressed hope their voices will be heard in the Trump administration after being frustrated by former President Joe Biden.",
      "This comes weeks after a second lease sale, mandated by a 2017 federal law, yielded no bids. The law required that two lease sales be offered by the end of 2024. The state earlier this month sued the Interior Department and federal officials, alleging among other things that the terms of the recent sale were too restrictive.",
      "Alaska leaders cheered Trump's order, which was titled, \u201cUnleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is morning again in Alaska,\u201d Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan declared.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump delivered on his first day in office!\u201d Dunleavy said on social media. \u201cThis is why elections matter.\u201d",
      "Alaska has a history of fighting perceived overreach by the federal government that affects the state's ability to develop its natural resources. State leaders complained during the Biden administration that efforts to further develop oil, gas and minerals were being unfairly hampered, though they also scored a major win with the approval in 2023 of a large oil project known as Willow in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Environmentalists are fighting that approval in court.",
      "Dunleavy has repeatedly argued that development of Alaska's vast resources are critical for its future, and he's billed the underground storage of carbon and carbon offset programs as a way to diversify revenues while continuing to develop oil, gas and coal and pursue timber programs.",
      "The state faces economic challenges: oil production, long its lifeblood, is a fraction of what it once was, in part due to aging fields, and for more than a decade, more people have left Alaska than have moved here.",
      "Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, called Trump's order an \u201ceverything, everywhere, all-at-once order\u201d that seeks to undo measures that in some cases it took the Biden administration years to enact.",
      "\u201cThe length of time it would take the Interior Department to accomplish everything in that executive order is at least one term\u2019s worth, maybe two. And even then, you would need the science on your side when it all comes back. And we know in the case of Alaska specifically, the science is not on the side of unlimited drilling,\" he said, pointing to climate concerns and the warming Arctic.",
      "Communities have experienced the impacts of climate change, including thinning sea ice, coastal erosion and thawing permafrost that undermines infrastructure.",
      "Erik Grafe, an attorney with the group Earthjustice, called the Arctic \u201cthe worst place to be expanding oil and gas development. No place is good because we need to be contracting and moving to a green economy and addressing the climate crisis.\u201d"

      "The South Korean government has announced it will reduce indirect subsidies for biomass energy",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The South Korean government will reduce subsidies for biomass energy after rising domestic and international criticism of its link to deforestation. Environmental activists generally applauded the reforms but criticized loopholes and slow timelines for phasing out the subsidies.",
      "\u201cWhile not without caveats, (the) decision by the South Korean government demonstrates that large-scale biomass power has no place in a renewable energy future,\u201d Hansae Song, program lead at South Korea-based nongovernmental organization Solutions for Our Climate, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Biomass power, predominantly generated by burning wood, is growing globally as countries accelerate their transition to use cleaner energy \u2014 even though many scientists and environmentalists see it as problematic. In South Korea, it's the second-largest source of renewable energy.",
      "South Korea has subsidized biomass energy with millions of dollars for more than a decade via their renewable energy certificates program. In a single recent the government gave approximately $688 million to support power plants using biomass, according to a press release from South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.",
      "Faced with limited domestic forest resources, South Korea\u2019s biomass power industry has structured its business model around importing large volumes of wood pellets at lower prices from forest-rich nations. In 2023, imports accounted for 82% of the country\u2019s wood pellet demand, making South Korea the world\u2019s third-largest importer of biomass fuels, after the United Kingdom and Japan. An AP report found that biomass imported from Indonesia was linked to deforestation of natural, intact forest.",
      "\u201cAs the (biomass) market expanded, various issues emerged,\u201d the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in their press release. \u201cCriticisms regarding forest degradation and carbon emissions associated with biomass power generation persist.\"",
      "Under the revised policy, South Korea will not support any new biomass power plants. Subsidies for six existing state-owned plants co-firing coal and biomass will end this year, while the value of renewable energy certificates for three state-owned dedicated biomass plants will be phased down by 2027. At privately owned plants, subsidies for co-fired biomass from six plants will be phased out over the next decade, while subsidy weightings will be reduced for 12 dedicated biomass plants over the next 15 years.",
      "But environmental activists are critical of loopholes in the new policy.",
      "Domestically produced wood pellets and chips will still have the same level of support as before, including those co-fired with coal \u2014 which experts say could pose a threat to South Korea\u2019s forests. Power plants under construction or in planning with approved business permits are exempt from the new policy and subject to the phased reduction timelines for existing facilities.",
      "State-owned co-firing facilities \u2014 which will lose their renewable energy certificates \u2014 currently account for only 10% of South Korea\u2019s biomass power fleet, while the phase-out of most private co-firing will take over a decade to complete under the new policy, said Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "\u201cThis extends the life of thermal power plants \u2014 many with emissions per unit of energy higher than coal \u2014 beyond the Paris Agreement-aligned coal phase-out deadlines,\u201d Song wrote in an email to AP.",
      "The South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea Forest Service and Ministry of Environment did not respond to requests for comment from AP.",
      "Experts said South Korea's policy change could signal a shift in how countries consider and incorporate biomass as part of their own energy transitions.",
      "\u201cThere has been a positive shift in terms of discourse around biomass subsidies,\u201d said Claire Squire, a research associate at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy Center for Global Sustainability. \u201cCutting subsidies won\u2019t necessarily fix everything, but potentially if they\u2019re constructed differently than they have in the past, that might be an improvement.\u201d",
      "As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said.",
      "Experts including the IEA say it\u2019s important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather.",
      "Many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests\u2019 ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is moving to end affirmative action in federal contracting and is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump 's administration moved Tuesday to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off.",
      "The moves follow an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government\u2019s diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. Trump has called the programs \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and insisted on restoring strictly \u201cmerit-based\u201d hiring.",
      "The executive order on affirmative action revokes an order issued by President Lyndon Johnson, and curtails DEI programs by federal contractors and grant recipients. It\u2019s using one of the key tools utilized by the Biden administration to promote DEI programs across the private sector \u2014 pushing their use by federal contractors \u2014 to now eradicate them.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management in a Tuesday memo directed agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline. Several federal departments had removed the webpages even before the memorandum. Agencies must also cancel any DEI-related training and end any related contracts, and federal workers are being asked to report to Trump's Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face \u201cadverse consequences.\u201d",
      "By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day. By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a \u201creduction-in-force action\u201d against those federal workers.",
      "The memo was first reported by CBS News.",
      "The move comes after Monday's executive order accused former President Joe Biden of forcing \u201cdiscrimination\u201d programs into \u201cvirtually all aspects of the federal government\u201d through \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d programs, known as DEI.",
      "That step is the first salvo in an aggressive campaign to upend DEI efforts nationwide, including leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to investigate private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against non-minority groups such as white men.",
      "The executive order picks up where Trump's first administration left off: One of Trump\u2019s final acts during his first term was an executive order banning federal agency contractors and recipients of federal funding from conducting anti-bias training that addressed concepts like systemic racism. Biden promptly rescinded that order on his first day in office and issued a pair of executive orders \u2014 now rescinded \u2014 outlining a plan to promote DEI throughout the federal government.",
      "While many changes may take months or even years to implement, Trump\u2019s new anti-DEI agenda is more aggressive than his first and comes amid far more amenable terrain in the corporate world. Prominent companies from Walmart to Facebook have already scaled back or ended some of their diversity practices in response to Trump's election and conservative-backed lawsuits against them.",
      "Here's a look at some of the policies and programs that Trump will aim to dismantle:",
      "Trump's order will immediately gut Biden's wide-ranging effort to embed diversity and inclusion practices in the federal workforce, the nation's largest at about 2.4 million people.",
      "Biden had mandated all agencies to develop a diversity plan, issue yearly progress reports, and contribute data for a government-wide dashboard to track demographic trends in hiring and promotions. The administration also set up a Chief Diversity Officers Council to oversee the implementation of the DEI plan. The government released its first DEI progress report in 2022 that included demographic data for the federal workforce, which is about 60% white and 55% male overall, and more than 75% white and more than 60% male at the senior executive level.",
      "Trump's executive order will toss out equity plans developed by federal agencies and terminate any roles or offices dedicated to promoting diversity. It will include eliminating initiatives such as DEI-related training or diversity goals in performance reviews.",
      "Trump's order paves the way for an aggressive but bureaucratically complicated overhaul of billions of dollars in federal spending that conservative activists claim unfairly carve out preference for racial minorities and women.",
      "The order does not specify which programs it will target but mandates a government-wide review to ensure that contracts and grants are compliant with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-DEI stance. It also proposes that the federal government settle ongoing lawsuits against federal programs that benefit historically underserved communities, including some that date back decades.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order is a \u201cseismic shift and a complete change in the focus and direction of the federal government,\u201d said Dan Lennington, deputy council for the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which has pursued several lawsuits against federal programs. The institute recently released an influential report listing dozens of programs the Trump administration should consider dismantling, such as credits for minority farmers or emergency relief assistance for majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "He acknowledged that unwinding some entrenched programs may be difficult. For example, the Treasury Department implements housing and other assistance programs through block grants to states that have their own methods for implementing diversity criteria.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will target every initiative that stemmed from Biden's DEI executive order.",
      "For example, the Biden administration banned federal agencies from asking about an applicant's salary history when setting compensation, a practice many civil rights activists say perpetuates pay disparities for women and people of color.",
      "It took three years for the Biden administration to issue the final regulations, and Trump would have to embark on a similar rule-making process, including a notice and comment period, to rescind it, said Chiraag Bains, former deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Biden and now a nonresident senior fellow with Brookings Metro.",
      "Noreen Farrell, executive director of gender rights group Equal Rights Advocates, said that she was hopeful that the Trump administration \u201cwill not go out of its way to undo the rule,\u201d which she said has proved popular in some state and cities that have enacted similar policies.",
      "And Biden's DEI plan encompassed some initiatives with bipartisan support, said Bains. For example, he tasked the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council with expanding federal employment opportunities for those with criminal records. That initiative stems from the Fair Chance Act, which Trump signed into law in 2019 and bans federal agencies and contractors from asking about an applicant\u2019s criminal history before a conditional job offer is made.",
      "Bains said that's what Biden's DEI policies were about: ensuring that the federal government was structured to include historically marginalized communities, not institute \u201creverse discrimination against white men.\u201d",
      "Despite the sweeping language of Trump's order, Farrell said, \u201cthe reality of implementing such massive structural changes is far more complex.\u201d",
      "\"Federal agencies have deeply embedded policies and procedures that can\u2019t simply be switched off overnight,\u201d she added."

      "The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems.

      "Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin\u2019s release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall. As of Tuesday afternoon, Trump\u2019s meme coin was trading at about $45 while the Melania meme coin was at about $4.",
      "Trump named SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as the agency's acting chief Tuesday and Uyeda quickly announced he was launching a new crypto task force to set the SEC on a \u201csensible regulatory path.\u201d Trump has promised to create a U.S. bitcoin stockpile and enact industry-friendly rules that make it easier for crypto companies to access the broader financial market.",
      "But by associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his ability to enact reforms.",
      "\u201cNow, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a casino for these meme coins,\u2019\u201d said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures. \u201cIt does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.\u201d",
      "The sale of Trump meme coins was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In promoting the meme coin, Trump told supporters to \u201cHave Fun!\u201d The website selling the tokens says they are meant as expressions of support and not an investment opportunity. The coin\u2019s website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years.",
      "The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement  that prohibits Trump from \u201cday-to-day\u201d decision making at the Trump Organization when he\u2019s president and limits financial information about the business shared with him.",

      "President Donald Trump has directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April, but a host of questions remain - including whether Trump has the authority to issue such an order and if TikTok\u2019s China-based parent would be amenable to selling the popular social media platform.",
      "In an executive order signed on Monday, Trump instructed the U.S. attorney general to not enforce the ban for 75 days while his administration determines \u201cthe appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown\u201d of TikTok.",
      "Under a federal law that was upheld by the Supreme Court last week, TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance was required to sell the platform to an approved buyer by Sunday or face a nationwide ban.

      "Some \u2014 at least as of now \u2014 appear to be taking a cautious approach. On Tuesday, Apple and Google, which operate the two most prominent app stores, did not offer TikTok or any other ByteDance-affiliated apps, such as Lemon8 or the video editing app CapCut, on their digital marketplaces.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know:",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government. But Trump does not have the power to overturn a law that Congress passed and subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The law does give the sitting president latitude on certain details, such as what would count as a \u201cqualified divesture\u201d of TikTok. But since an extension on a ban can only occur if \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made towards a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform, it\u2019s possible that Trump\u2019s order could face legal challenges.",
      "On Tuesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization that filed amicus briefs in support of TikTok\u2019s legal challenge against the statute, said it believed it would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d to ignore the law.",

      "The order also warns possible challengers that because of \u201cthe national security interests at stake,\u201d attempts by parties to enforce the law \u201crepresents an encroachment on the powers\u201d of the executive branch.",
      "Even if an extension faces and fails to withstand legal scrutiny, it will buy time for ByteDance and TikTok to figure out their next move.",

      "According to TikTok, roughly 60% of the privately-held ByteDance is owned by global investors, such as General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance employees and the company\u2019s founder, Zhang Yiming, also each have a 20% stake.",
      "The technology company has not disclosed financial details for its subsidiaries, including TikTok\u2019s global or U.S. operation.",
      "Even if an American company can acquire a 50% stake in TikTok, it\u2019s unclear how a Trump-orchestrated transaction would address some of the national security concerns that led lawmakers and the Biden administration to push for a divestment.",
      "For example, Trump has not addressed whether he will allow ByteDance to keep controlling the TikTok algorithm that fuels what users see on the platform. The algorithm, which is updated and maintained by ByteDance engineers in China, has been one of the main concerns among supporters of the law.",
      "Trump's executive order notes the administration must have a review period to assess government intelligence and the steps TikTok has taken to address Washington's concerns.",
      "Most likely, lots of negotiations about the future of TikTok.",

      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, a managing director of the Teneo consultancy, wrote that if amicable negotiations happen, Beijing might ultimately approve the export of TikTok\u2019s algorithm. However, a sale that excludes that technology might be more feasible legally and technically, Wildau wrote.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising to eliminate what he incorrectly labels \u201cthe electric vehicle mandate\u201d imposed under former President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order promising to eliminate what he incorrectly labels \u201cthe electric vehicle mandate\u201d imposed under former President Joe Biden. His order on Monday is consistent with pledges Trump made on the campaign trail to end what he calls a \u201cpreposterous\u201d focus on EV's by Biden and other Democrats. The order, along with other steps expected in a second Trump administration, could slow U.S. efforts to address climate change, much of which is caused by burning gasoline and diesel fuel that emit carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "Here is a look at Trump's actions and what happens next.",
      "Trump's order said he would \u201celiminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate\u201d and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles.\" While there is no Biden \u201cmandate\u201d to force the purchase of EVs, the Democratic president's policies were aimed at encouraging Americans to buy them and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.",
      "Trump's order, entitled \"Unleashing American Energy,'' also said his administration would terminate \"where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.\u201d",
      "Language in the order and others issued by Trump on Monday indicate he is likely to seek to repeal a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden's landmark 2022 climate law, as well as roll back Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency rules to tighten limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution from passenger and commercial vehicles.",
      "Trump has also promised to end a federal exemption that allows California to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. The federal waiver is important not only to California but also to more than a dozen other states that follow its nation-leading standards on vehicle emissions.",
      "Trump\u2019s order Monday was reminiscent of action taken during his first term in the White House, when he rolled back tough vehicle emissions standards set under Democratic then-President Barack Obama.",
      "In the executive order, Trump also put an immediate pause to billions of dollars in funding allocated for EV charging stations appropriated through the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law approved in 2021.",
      "Biden had set a goal of creating 500,000 such chargers by 2030. As of late last year, there were 214 operational chargers in 12 states that have been funded through the federal laws, with 24,800 projects underway across the country, according to the Federal Highway Administration. A total of more than 203,000 publicly available charging ports are operating across the U.S., with nearly 1,000 being turned on every week, according to the agency. This is more than double the number available in 2021.",
      "While in office, Biden set a goal for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 to be electric and dedicated funding to EV charging infrastructure through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant programs.",
      "Under the former president, the EPA created tailpipe limits to curb planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles. The final rules are the most ambitious standards of their kind in the nation. Still, automakers could meet the EPA\u2019s limits with sales of EVs as low as 30% in 2032, along with more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.",
      "Also under Biden, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set standards on fuel-efficiency requirements, which required new vehicles sold in the nation to average about 38 miles per gallon of gasoline in 2031, up from about 29 mpg in 2024.",
      "Both sets of rules inherently incentivized automakers to electrify their lineups for American car buyers.",
      "Though the pace of EV sales growth in the U.S. slowed last year, EVs accounted for 8.1% of new vehicle sales, up from 7.9% the year before, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "While the cost of EVs has slowly come down as the auto industry scales manufacturing of the vehicles and expensive battery prices improve, they still cost more upfront than traditional gasoline-powered cars.",
      "Even before Monday's order, some automakers have pulled back ambitious plans to go electric. Ford nixed plans for electric three-row SUVs in lieu of making them gas-electric hybrids; General Motors delayed production at an EV battery cell plant.",
      "Temporarily, sales of EVs could skyrocket as car-buyers rush to take advantage of existing tax credits encouraging electrified car purchases.",
      "But the order also means the U.S. could have a more challenging time meeting emissions reductions goals in the long run. Light-duty cars and trucks are responsible for more than half of the U.S. greenhouse gases from transportation, and the sector itself is a major contributor to the nation\u2019s overall emissions.",
      "Any action to roll back or revise regulations is likely to face legal challenges from environmental groups and others.",
      "\u201cThese clean car rollbacks will burden Americans with a Trumpfecta of higher prices, more pollution and weaker competitiveness,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. \u201cTrump\u2019s attacking the biggest single step ever taken to fight climate pollution.\"",

      "Small businesses had a merry December, as shoppers wrapped up their holiday shopping",
      "NEW YORK -- Small businesses had a merry December, as shoppers wrapped up their holiday shopping.",
      "That's according to the Fiserv Small Business Index.",
      "In the U.S., the seasonally adjusted index for December was 146, up 3 points from November. The figure is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online across about 2 million U.S. small businesses.",
      "\u201cSmall business sales continued their growth in December despite consumer spending patterns beginning to shift,\u201d said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. \u201cNotably, consumers diverted more spend to service-based business, retail spending continued to display strength, and consumers spent less dining out as average restaurant ticket sizes continued to decline.\u201d",
      "Fiserv, a payment and financial services technology company, found that small business sales rose 4.9% and total transactions grew 5.5% from December the year prior.",
      "That echoed trends at larger businesses. The National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, said holiday sales in November and December rose 4% to $994.1 billion compared with the previous year. For the holiday period in 2023, sales increased 3.9% compared with the previous two-month period. The holiday sales growth was above the group\u2019s expectations for a 2.5% to 3.5% increase for the period.",
      "Retail spending at small businesses remained a high point. Retail sales rose 4.9% and transactions rose 5.8% in December. The strongest selling categories were general merchandise, clothing, shoes and jewelry retailers, furniture, electronics, appliances and grocery.",
      "Restaurants, however, were weaker. Sales fell 3.4% from December a year ago, even though transactions rose 4.1%. Full-service restaurants, including upscale and family dining locations, were the weakest performers, while quick service and fast casual restaurants performed better. The disparity in sales and transactions was the result of a significant reduction in average ticket size, down 7.4%, compared to 2023.",

      "TOKYO -- Dozens of major Japanese companies have pulled their commercials on Fuji Television amid allegations company officials tried to cover up a sex scandal involving one of the country\u2019s most famous TV hosts.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former member of the super popular male band SMAP and now a popular host at Fuji and other Japanese networks. Nakai has been linked by local media to an alleged sexual assault at a party reportedly arranged by one of Fuji TV's staff.",
      "After the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement between Nakai and a woman over the alleged sexual assault at a 2023 dinner party, the former SMAP star issued a statement acknowledging a settlement over \u201ca trouble,\u201d but he denied using any violence.",
      "News of the scandal did not immediately trigger a flood of pullouts by sponsors. But many apparently started replacing their commercials with public service announcements after a news conference Friday by Fuji TV that triggered criticism that the company was lacking transparency and contrition over the affair.",
      "Major sponsors such as automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.; cosmetics maker Shiseido; retailer Seven & I Holding Co. and life insurer Meiji Yasuda announced they were pulling ads from Fuji TV. Local media reports said more than 50 companies had done the same.",
      "Nissan said Tuesday that it had pulled its Fuji TV adds and was watching developments before deciding on further steps.",
      "During Friday's news conference, Fuji TV President Koichi Minato apologized and acknowledged his company had not disclosed the problem despite becoming aware of it about six months before the Shukan Bunshun report. Minato said Fuji TV would investigate the case but also said he believed his employees had not done anything wrong.",
      "Fuji TV apologized for causing trouble to many advertisers and agencies but declined to disclose details.",
      "The latest edition of Shukan Bunshun, published Thursday, cited an unnamed female Fuji announcer who alleged that the senior company official linked to the 2023 dinner party had arranged other similar parties for Nakai and Fuji TV.",
      "Fuji only publicly announced the inquiry after one of its largest shareholders, Rising Sun Management, criticized the company and demanded a full investigation and appropriate action. Rising Sun is an affiliate of the U.S. investment management firm Dalton Investment.",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including massive abuses by the now-defunct talent agency Johnny & Associates, which managed SMAP and many other boy bands. In 2023, it admitted to sexual abuse against hundreds of boys and young men by its late founder, entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa."

      "PANAMA CITY -- President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence Monday that he wants the Panama Canal back under U.S. control fed nationalist sentiment and worry in Panama, home to the critical trade route and a country familiar with U.S. military intervention.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal,\u201d Trump said Monday.",
      "In the capital, some Panamanians saw Trump\u2019s remarks as a way of applying pressure on Panama for something else he wants: better control of migration through the Darien Gap. Others recalled the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama with concern.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded forcefully, as he did after Trump\u2019s initial statement last month that the U.S. should consider repossessing the canal, saying the canal belongs to his country of 4 million and will remain Panama\u2019s territory.",
      "Panama's U.N. Mission sent Mulino's statement to the U.N. Security Council. The statement rejected \u201cin its entirety\" Trump's comments on the canal and said: \u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration.\u201d",
      "Luis Barrera, a 52-year-old cab driver, said Panama had fought hard to get the canal back and has expanded it since taking control.",
      "\u201cI really feel uncomfortable because it\u2019s like when you\u2019re big and you take a candy from a little kid,\u201d Barrera said.",
      "At a rally in Phoenix in December, Trump said he might try to get the canal back after it was \u201cfoolishly\u201d ceded to Panama. He complained that shippers were overcharged and that China had taken control of the key shortcut between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump wouldn\u2019t rule out using military force to take it back.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "The canal is a point of pride for Panamanians. On Dec. 31, they celebrated the 25th anniversary of the handover, and days later they commemorated the deaths of 21 Panamanians who died at the hands of the U.S. military decades earlier.",
      "On Jan. 9, 1964, students protested in the then-U.S. controlled canal zone over not being allowed to fly Panama\u2019s flag at a secondary school there. The protests expanded to general opposition to the U.S. presence in Panama and U.S. troops got involved. A group of protesters this year burned an effigy of Trump.",
      "The canal\u2019s administrator, Ricaurte V\u00e1squez, said this month that China is not in control of the canal and that all nations are treated equally under a neutrality treaty.",
      "He said Chinese companies operating in the ports on either end of the canal were part of a Hong Kong consortium that won a bidding process in 1997. He added that U.S. and Taiwanese companies operate other ports along the canal as well.",
      "Omayra Avenda\u00f1o, who works in real estate, said Trump\u2019s threat should be taken seriously.",
      "\u201cWe should be worried,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an army and he\u2019s said he would use force.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 20, 1989, the U.S. military invaded Panama to remove dictator Manuel Noriega. Some 27,000 troops were tasked by then-President George H.W. Bush with capturing Noriega, protecting the lives of Americans living in Panama and restoring democracy to the country that a decade later would take over control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Avenda\u00f1o said she was 11 years old the last time the U.S. invaded her country and hoped Panama\u2019s current government would seek international support to head off Trump\u2019s designs on the canal.",
      "\u201cI remember the disaster that it was,\u201d she said."

      "LONDON -- The sequel to Prince Harry vs. the British tabloids begins Tuesday in a high-stakes trial pitting him against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers that could cost him millions even if he wins.",
      "Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, and one other claimant remain alone among hundreds who have settled lawsuits against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, over a llegations their phones were hacked and investigators unlawfully snooped on their lives.",
      "It will be the first case of its kind to go to trial against the publisher since a widespread phone hacking scandal forced Murdoch to close News of the World in 2011. News Group has settled more than 1,300 other claims.",
      "For the Duke of Sussex, it will be the second trial in London's High Court in his long-running feud with the press that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash while being chased by paparazzi. He also blames them for persistent attacks on his wife, actor Meghan Markle, that led them to leave the royal life and flee to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry has said his mission to hold the media accountable has led to a rift with his family but it's one he feels compelled to carry out to expose wrongdoing.",
      "He won a similar case against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023 and he has another case pending against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
      "Here's a look at the case:",
      "Harry claims News Group journalists and private investigators they hired violated his privacy by using unlawful tactics to dig up dirt on him and his family between 1996 and 2011.",
      "His fellow claimant, Tom Watson, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party, said his voicemails were intercepted during a period when he was investigating the hacking scandal.",
      "Their lawyer said the newspapers had a widespread practice of using deception to obtain medical, phone and flight records, bugged homes and placed listening devices in cars.",
      "They allege that executives concealed the skullduggery through means that included destroying documents.",
      "\u201cThis allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied,\u201d News Group said in a statement.",
      "Former executives accused of playing a role include Will Lewis, now CEO of the Washington Post, and Rebekah Brooks, CEO of News UK, a division of News Corp. They have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Brooks was acquitted of phone hacking conspiracy charges in a criminal trial in 2014, though her former colleague, Andy Coulson, who was later spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, was jailed.",
      "News Group strongly denies the allegations and it said Harry failed to bring his lawsuit within the required six-year limit.",
      "News Group apologized to News of the World phone hacking victims in 2011. The Sun has never accepted liability.",
      "Actor Hugh Grant had been one of Harry's remaining co-claimants, but said he was forced to accept \u201can enormous sum of money\u201d to settle because he could have faced a legal bill of 10 million pounds ($12.3 million) even if he won at trial.",
      "Under English civil law, a claimant who wins a court judgment that is lower than what they were offered to settle, has to pay the legal bills for both sides. The law is intended to discourage lengthy trials.",
      "Despite the grave financial risk, Harry told The New York Times Dealbook Summit in December that he was not going to fold.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve settled because they\u2019ve had to settle,\" he said of other claimants. \"One of the main reasons for seeing this through is accountability, because I\u2019m the last person that can actually achieve that.\u201d",
      "The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, will put Harry back in the witness box for several days in February.",
      "In 2023, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since the late 19th century, when Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, testified twice.",
      "That has put Harry at odds with a family famous for a \u201cnever complain, never explain\" attitude.",

      "\u201cThe mission continues, but it has, yes, it\u2019s caused, as you say, part of a rift,\u201d Harry said in the documentary \u201cTabloids On Trial.\u201d",
      "Harry said he wished his family had joined him in making a stand against media offenses.",
      "\u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m doing this for my reasons,\u201d he said.",
      "News Group has failed to kill the case over the past two years, but Harry has experienced some setbacks in a series of sometimes bruising hearings.",
      "The publisher succeeded in getting Harry's phone hacking claims thrown out because the judge said he should have been aware of the widely publicized scandal and could have brought his lawsuit sooner.",

      "Harry alleged Murdoch, who was chief executive of the company that controlled NGN, was part of the effort to conceal evidence of hacking or had \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to it. The judge said those allegations would add nothing material to claims that include other \u201ctrusted lieutenants,\u201d such as Brooks and Murdoch\u2019s younger son, James Murdoch.",

      "ATLANTA -- For the first time since the 2022 countrywide outbreak, bird flu hit a poultry producer in Georgia, the nation's top state for chicken production.",
      "The state Department of Agriculture announced Friday that the agency has detected a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at a commercial poultry producer in Elbert County, approximately 100 miles (165 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The agency suspended all poultry exhibitions, shows, swaps, meets and sales.",
      "The virus has been detected four times in Georgia, but only in backyard flocks previously, including among 13 chickens and ducks earlier this month in Clayton County south of Atlanta.",

      "The producer first noticed clinical signs of bird flu Wednesday at the Elbert County location, according to the release. The Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network confirmed a positive virus detection Thursday afternoon, which the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory also confirmed Friday. The site had about 45,000 broiler breeders when bird flu was detected.",

      "MILAN -- The independent Italian fashion brand Simon Cracker denounced the luxury fashion system with an upcycled collection previewed during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday that riffed on what they see as bygone days of quality and creativity.",
      "The coed looks created from recovered and deadstock garments, materials and accessories included a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Hermes\u2019 highly prized Birkin bag, with the designers drawing the telltale hardware on leather bags or screen-printing images of the coveted bag on sweaters.",
      "Co-creative directors Simone Botte and Filippo Biraghi were delighted that Walmart came out with what was widely seen as a Birkin knockoff while they were working on this collection.",
      "\u201cPeople have lost interest in fashion,'' Biraghi said. \"They have been taken for a ride for 20 years. And with 50 wars in the world, climate change, we all are getting poorer. There is no longer a connection between price and value. At a certain point, you can't go on.\u2019\u2019",
      "The collection pokes fun at the typical Milanese signora, known in dialect as sciura, sending her up with funky tweed separates, a foulard and even a tiny dog. Each silhouette is unique, constructed from garments the pair recover from dry cleaners and other sources, and models slide into character with insouciant slouches and exaggerated catwalk strides.",
      "The brand extended its collaboration with Doc Martens, decorated with trompe l\u2019oeil ballerina shoes. At times, skirts, collars and decorative fringe were fashioned out of shiny tinsel packing material, and ribbons covered shoes.",
      "The show closed with a garment completely concealed by luxury tags from Biraghi\u2019s own wardrobe collected over the years. \"We are making fun of wealth,'' he said.",
      "The Simon Cracker runway critique hits the sector when its down \u2014 and analysts say in need of reform.",
      "A new study by McKinsey consultancy and The Business of Fashion said that top brands are facing a significant slowdown this year, after a four-year period of exceptional growth from 2019-2023 that allowed the sector to grow by a compounded 5% a year despite the pandemic.",
      "Most of that expansion \u2014 a full 80% \u2014 was due to price increases that outpaced innovation, the McKinsey-Business of Fashion report said.",
      "The Bain consultancy similarly has forecast a contraction of 2% for 2025, the first since the Great Recession, not including the 2020 pandemic year. It cited a crisis in creativity along side global turbulence.",
      "The findings are of no surprise to Botte and Biraghi.",
      "\u201cIf a garment is not interesting, it it doesn\u2019t tell a story, if there is nothing creative, who cares,'' said Biraghi. \u201cWe all have lots of clothes, too many. We don\u2019t need more.\u201d",
      "Italian singer Chiara Galiazzo was in the front row dressed in a pinstripe and plaid jacket painted in sky blue and worn with royal blue Bermuda cutoffs and matching painted boots. She said she was drawn to the brand by its authenticity.",
      "\u201cI feel like I am part of a community,\u2019\u2019 she said after the show. \u201cI think this is something that is important, and a lot of fun.\u201d"

      "While the Milan Fall-Winter 2025-2026 runway was full of faux fur collars, Prada went the usual step beyond and created primitive detailing in shearling that looked almost torn from the beast and set askew on outerwear lapels, or patchworked into garments.",
      "\u201cMaybe, it reads as savage, primitive cavemen. I think that our aim was to make it feel warm and human and instinctive, but also kind of beautifully domestic in a way,\u201d Simons said backstage.",
      "Cinematic references were broad and not specific to any film, director or even character type, Simons said. Western touches included scuffed cowboy boots and knitwear mimicking a wrangler\u2019s shirt - without creating characters or caricatures.",
      "Feminine touches flourished. Men were invited to wear jewelry, such as bracelets with mini basketballs or baseballs. Chains with amulets hung from fine knits. Fake fur-lined hoods came in florals.",
      "The silhouette mixed skinny trousers, often in bright rock-and-roll satin, with more ample volumes like pajama tops or slightly ratty sweaters. Suits required no shirts, as the designers advocated instinctive dressing.",
      "One look seemed to distill the collection to its boyish essence: Straight leg jeans with a knit top featuring striped detailing, worn with floral-stamped cowboy boots.",
      "The designers said the collection was meant to offer hope in difficult times, proffering humanity as a form of resistance to whatever may be oppressing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an answer to what of course is happening. We have to resist with our instinct, with our humanity, with our passion, with our romance,\u2019\u2019 Prada said backstage. Good work, she said, is also a form of resistance.",
      "The message contained in the collection \"has to be optimistic by definition and in principle,\u2019\u2019 Prada said.",
      "The ever-transforming showroom inside the Prada Foundation\u2019s Deposito contemporary art space was sheathed in Art Noveau carpet, and the runway was set on raised metal scaffolding. Simons said it represented contrasts, decoration and a work-in-progress.",
      "Suits require no shirts. Two puffers are better than one. Raw shearling collars let loose primitive instincts. Subtle jewelry and florals for men. Cowboy boots.",
      "Prada's front row hailed from across the globe and disciplines, including British actor and musician William Gao, arriving with British musician Olivia Hardy, U.S. actor Keith Powers, South Korean actress Kim Tae-ri, Chinese table tennis player Ma Long and British actor Louis Patridge. A crowd of fans waited just beyond a barricade to cheer them all."

      "A settlement has been reached by North Carolina's Insurance Department and the industry that sells homeowner policies",
      "RALEIGH. N.C. -- Base rates for North Carolina homeowners' insurance premiums will increase on average by about 15% by mid-2026 as part of a settlement reached by the state Insurance Department and the industry.",
      "The agreement announced Friday by Commissioner Mike Causey contrasts with the January 2024 request by the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies, seeking a 42.2% overall average increase.",
      "Causey, an elected official who began his third term earlier this month, formally rejected the bureau's request last year. That led to a formal hearing that began in October and included multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments. The state Insurance Department said its witnesses would contend rates should be lowered or increased by less than 3%.",
      "Except for the settlement, a hearing officer \u2014 in consultation with Causey \u2014 would have decided what the new rates should be. The Rate Bureau could have appealed that decision in court.",
      "Causey said in a news release that the proposed rate increases \u201care sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims.\"",
      "The bureau attributed its large request to high inflation \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms and \u201cseverely inadequate\u201d premium rates to cover claims. The bureau\u2019s requested increases had varied widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to over 99% in some beach areas.",
      "The agreed-upon increases, carried out in two parts, will vary based on location. On average statewide, the base rate will increase by 7.5% on June 1 and by another 7.5% on June 1, 2026.",
      "The highest increases generally will occur in parts of eastern North Carolina hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. For example, beach areas from Carteret to Brunswick counties will see an average 16% increase in mid-2025 and an additional 15.9% in mid-2026.",
      "Areas harmed the most by historic flooding from Hurricane Helene in the fall will face lower-than-average increases. Base rates in Buncombe, Watauga and Yancey counties, for example, will increase by 4.4% in 2025 and 4.5% in mid-2026.",
      "Among highly populated areas, base rates in Raleigh and Durham will increase on average by 7.5% in each of the next two years. In Charlotte, rates would increase by 9.3% in 2025 and by 9.2 % in 2026.",
      "The settlement also bars the Rate Bureau from undertaking an effort to increase rates again before June 1, 2027, Causey's release said.",
      "Bureau Chief Operating Officer Jarred Chappell said separately that the settlement is \u201ca step in the right direction\" but that the bureau had asked for a larger increase \u201cbecause that\u2019s what recent claims data called for.\"",
      "\"Storms have gotten stronger and more damaging, more people are living in disaster-prone areas, inflation in the construction industry has been particularly high and reinsurance costs have exploded. All these cost drivers remain an issue,\u201d Chappell said in a written statement.",
      "North Carolina insurance law contains a \u201cconsent-to-rate\u201d exception that allows industry members to insure high-risk homeowners if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau\u2019s rate.",
      "While some insurers have pulled out of disaster-prone parts of North Carolina, the exception has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers from the state. About 40% of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policies were set by consent-to-rate policies in 2022, The News & Observer reported."

      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",

      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",

Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

    "story": [
      "Indiana\u2019s Rick Carlisle has coached more games against San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich than anyone else",
      "PARIS -- Indiana's Rick Carlisle has coached more games against San Antonio's Gregg Popovich than anyone else. They've had 87 head-to-head matchups, including playoffs.",
      "Thursday was supposed to be No. 88.",
      "It won't happen, and nobody knows when \u2014 or if \u2014 Popovich will be back on the Spurs' sideline. Popovich's absence is a glaring one in Paris this week for the pair of NBA matchups between the Pacers and Spurs on Thursday and Saturday; he's back home, recovering from a November stroke.",
      "The Spurs say he's making progress. Some coaches from around the league have heard the same. That's about the extent of the updates; nobody says much more than that out of respect for Popovich and his privacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really an institution and he\u2019s been such a constant,\" Carlisle said. \"It\u2019s different not seeing him. But I\u2019ve had some communication with him. He\u2019s doing better all the time. And the hope is he'll be back.\u201d",
      "It's certain that not being in Paris \u2014 one of his favorite cities \u2014 is particularly painful for Popovich this week. This trip has many of the things that he loves most: people from different cultures, incredible food, some basketball and, of course, wine. Lots of wine. He's basically the NBA's sommelier, and the dinners he would have thrown in Paris surely would have been legendary.",
      "Popovich, who turns 76 next week, is the NBA\u2019s all-time wins leader who has guided the Spurs to five championships, plus he coached USA Basketball to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He had the stroke at the team's arena in San Antonio on Nov. 2, getting tended to by emergency personnel who were at the arena for the Spurs' game that night.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s changed my life in terms of just being able to learn under him, watch him from afar and closely, and get to the point where we could challenge each other in ways,\" acting Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to be able to grow in my voice and be empowered by him in many ways. And we are in contact constantly. He is watching games, still as opinionated as he\u2019s ever been, and competitive, and what you would think \u2014 giving praise and cussing me out, all at the same time.\u201d",
      "Johnson took over on almost no notice for that game on Nov. 2 against Minnesota. The Spurs won that game and are 17-19 since Popovich had the stroke, winning six out of eight games in one stretch and four out of five in another. They're in a bit of a slide right now, losing six of their last seven contests. (It should be noted that those wins and losses since Nov. 2, by NBA rule, still go on Popovich's career record because he's still listed as the head coach.)",
      "\u201cPop\u2019s health has been the priority since the start of this and until dot-dot-dot,\" Johnson said. \"That's kind of how we, and I, take the approach. We want the best for Pop and I want the best for this team and however I can help is where I'll put my energy.\u201d",
      "San Antonio guard Chris Paul joined the Spurs last summer in large part because of his respect for Popovich. He has a photo of himself on the phone in Las Vegas, talking to Popovich when the deal got done.",
      "Turns out, there's far more opportunities for phone time with Pop than Paul ever envisioned.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not even sure if this is public, but he calls,\" Paul said. \u201cHe calls after games and I talk to him, and he tells me what he sees, and I appreciate that more than anything because he doesn\u2019t have to do that. And he does.\u201d",
      "The thing is, Popovich likely feels like he does have to do that. It's still his team. He's still the coach. Johnson is still one of his assistants. He's still the president. He's just not on the sideline. Or in practice. Or, this week, in Paris.",
      "Will he coach this season? Next season? Ever again? Will he come back in a different capacity? All are valid questions, and the Spurs \u2014 a tight-lipped organization by nature \u2014 either don't know the answers or can't offer them yet.",
      "It's also unknown what aftereffects of the stroke, if any, Popovich is dealing with. Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year.",
      "\u201cAll I can share is he's attacking his rehab in a way that ... you know Pop, you\u2019ve observed him for years,\" Spurs CEO R.C. Buford, one of the people closest to Popovich, said Wednesday. \u201cThe same resilience that he\u2019s shown over the course of our career as a coach, he\u2019s approaching his return in his rehab in an incredibly unique way. The relationships that he had with our former players and the care that they\u2019re sharing with him is amazing. And his improvement continues.\u201d",
      "Time will tell the rest.",

Besides having that winning gene, it's about how tough, we've got tough dudes. It's how competitive, we've got competitive dudes. It's basketball IQ, we have high basketball IQ guys.\u201d",
      "Louisville (15-5, 8-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) already has exceeded its combined overall and conference win totals from the past two seasons under Kenny Payne. He finished 12-52 in his first collegiate coaching job long after being a standout player for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum and a member of the Cardinals' 1986 national championship team.",
      "In its first game as a Top 25 team since January 2021, Louisville won 98-73 at ACC newcomer SMU on Tuesday night.

      "Victor Wembanyama stood on the center stripe of a new outdoor court in his hometown, his arms outstretched to their full 8-foot wingspan as he posed for a slew of photographers",
      "LE CHESNAY, France -- Victor Wembanyama stood on the center stripe of a new outdoor court in his hometown, his arms outstretched to their full 8-foot wingspan as he posed for a slew of photographers.",
      "He could not have seemed happier.",
      "Wembanyama unveiled a gift of sorts to his hometown and the next generation on Tuesday, a pair of outdoor courts \u2014 one for 5-on-5 play, the other for 3-on-3 play \u2014 that were built to the specifications that he wanted and sketched out himself.",
      "\u201cFor those of you that don\u2019t know, this started in a room with an idea,\" San Antonio general manager Brian Wright said, as about five dozen kids sat on the court in front of him and another 100 or so people watched from adjacent courtside seating. \"And I remember watching Victor going on a whiteboard and literally drawing every single detail of the court that you see today and putting his heart and soul into designing this court for the children to play on. It speaks to how special you are and how special this is to you, so thank you, Victor.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama and the Spurs are in France this week, playing a pair of games Thursday and Saturday in Paris against the Indiana Pacers. France is Wembanyama's homeland, as everyone knows. And it's often assumed that he's from Paris, but he's from Le Chesnay \u2014 about 12 miles (20 kilometers) west of the city.",
      "It was important to him to make this happen in time for the Spurs' visit there. Others did not think that was realistic.",
      "\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Le Chesnay's mayor, Richard Delepierre.",
      "The challenges were many: There were old courts in that space to excavate, designs to be approved, it's not great weather for construction at this time of year, and if all that wasn't enough, building anything so close to the Palace of Versailles seems to be a bit of logistical headache, to say the least.",
      "But it's what Wemby wanted. And that makes things happen, especially in his hometown.",
      "\u201cBeyond his immense basketball talents, it seems that Victor possesses great qualities of art and a certain capacity for persuasion,\u201d Delepierre said.",
      "Construction really got going just a couple months ago. But on Tuesday, on a chilly afternoon, it was finished. The new nets were in place, the fibers still tight together as if to show not a single shot had gone through them yet. The kids peeled back a black drape to show off the center court design \u2014 a nod to both the Spurs' logo and the Le Chesnay clock tower \u2014 and Wembanyama caught a lob for the ceremonial first dunk.",
      "\u201cIt was my dream also to have these kind of courts when I was living here,\u201d Wembanyama said.",
      "Le Chesnay is a small city of about 30,000, a little west of downtown Paris. From town hall there's a view of the Palace of Versailles, the home King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette shared in the late 18th century before he was beheaded during the French Revolution. Local legend suggests Napoleon roamed the area at times, even ordering that trees be planted to line the streets a certain way.",
      "It is also where Wembanyama's basketball life began to grow.",
      "Local officials say the majority of residents there \u2014 the Chesnaycourtois and Chesnaycourtoise \u2014 take part in some sort of sporting activity. Wembanyama created a bit of a stir in town when he brought friends in for an impromptu pickup soccer match last year, some of them roaming the same field that they did as little kids. Handball is extremely popular there, as are auto racing and equestrian. There even was a filly named Le Chesnay that raced at the famed Saratoga Race Course in 2009.",
      "But, officially or unofficially, it's a basketball town now. Kids are playing the game all the time in Le Chesnay, most of them \u2014 as one would guess \u2014 wearing Spurs jerseys or T-shirts. Wembanyama's 6-foot-3 mother, Elodie de Fautereau, was a standout player and became a coach.",
      "\u201cThe Spurs \u2018Play Paris\u2019 initiative isn\u2019t just about building a court, it\u2019s about creating a vibrant hub for the community that honors Victor\u2019s journey and his commitment to giving back,\u201d said RC Buford, CEO of Spurs Sports and Entertainment. \u201cThis renovated space will hopefully inspire the next generation and showcase the power of sports to bring people together.\u201d",
      "The Spurs haven't said what they spent on the project, but it was a \u201csignificant\u201d part of the estimated $500,000 budget, Delepierre said. It's also important to note that the courts aren't some Wembanyama tribute; the city logo and the Spurs logo are present, but nothing that screams the 2023-24 NBA rookie of the year's name.",
      "He didn't want them to be about him. And they got done just in time.",
      "\u201cImpossible,\u201d Delepierre said, taking back his previous declaration, \u201cis not French.\u201d",

      "Novak Djokovic has come back to defeat Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals for the 12th time",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic refused to let anything stop his pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam trophy in the Australian Open quarterfinals. Not a problem with his left leg. Not an early deficit. And not the kid across the net, Carlos Alcaraz, who was making things difficult and eyeing his own bit of history.",
      "Djokovic overcame it all, just as he has so often along the way to so many triumphs, moving into the semifinals at Melbourne Park for the 12th time with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Alcaraz in a scintillating showdown Tuesday night between a pair of stars born 16 years apart and at opposite ends of their careers.",
      "The action was non-stop, the shot-making brilliant, even as the match stretched on for more than 3 1/2 hours and nearly to 1 a.m. \u2014 never more so, perhaps, than when Alcaraz saved a break point that would have put Djokovic ahead 5-2 in the fourth set, allowing him to serve for the win. The 33-stroke exchange was the longest of the evening, and when it ended with Djokovic sailing a forehand long, the capacity crowd at Rod Laver Arena went wild. Djokovic reached for his bothersome leg and yelled toward his entourage; Alcaraz, his chest heaving, leaned on a towel box and grinned.",
      "Turned out that only delayed the final result.",
      "With his wife, son and daughter cheering in the stands, the No. 7-seeded Djokovic prevailed thanks to the sort of remarkable returning and no-mistakes-made groundstrokes against Alcaraz that now-retired rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal dealt with for years.",
      "Djokovic enjoyed some of his own best efforts in the latter stages, pointing to his ear or blowing kisses or spreading his arms while puffing out his chest. There was the forehand winner on a 22-stroke point that earned the break for a 5-3 lead in the third set. There was that set\u2019s last point, which included a back-to-the-net sprint to chase down a lob. Alcaraz wasn\u2019t shy, either, shouting \u201cVamos!\u201d and pumping his fists after one particularly booming forehand in the fourth set.",
      "On Friday, Djokovic\u2019s 50th major semifinal will come against No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev, a two-time runner-up at majors who beat No. 12 Tommy Paul 7-6 (1), 7-6 (0), 2-6, 6-1. The other men\u2019s quarterfinals are Wednesday: No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 8 Alex de Minaur, and No. 21 Ben Shelton against unseeded Lorenzo Sonego.",

      "Betts described Sasaki as being very reserved, which must be partly attributed to a language barrier.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 08:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "There were several calls in the NFL's divisional round of the playoffs that drew scrutiny from broadcasters and fans alike over the weekend",
    "story": [
      "There were several calls in the NFL's divisional round of the playoffs that drew scrutiny from broadcasters and fans alike over the weekend",
      "NFL officials were heavily scrutinized for some of the flags they threw in the four divisional round games that saw the Chiefs, Bills, Eagles and Commanders advance to next weekend's conference championships.",
      "Yet, it was one play that didn't draw a flag could prove a most consequential non-call if the NFL decides to join the NBA and NHL in seriously cracking down on floppers, as ESPN broadcaster Troy Aikman suggested during the Texans-Chiefs game.",
      "NFL players can be penalized for the big umbrella \u201cunsportsmanlike conduct\" infraction, but there isn't an official rule against flopping, and Aikman urged the league to address that during one of his several conversations with Joe Buck over the officiating in the Chiefs' 23-14 victory.",
      "On the same possession where he benefitted from his late slide that caused two Texans to crash into each other, drawing a widely panned unnecessary roughness flag, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes appeared to try to deke referee Clay Martin's officiating crew into throwing another flag to aid Kansas City's drive, which ended with a touchdown that put the Chiefs up by eight in the fourth quarter.",
      "Scrambling to his left, Mahomes pulled up just as he went out of bounds. When linebacker Henry To'oTo'o tapped him, Mahomes throws himself dramatically to the ground but failed to fool the officials \u2014 or impress Aikman, the Hall of Fame quarterback who earlier took umbrage at the roughing-the-passer call against Houston.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to draw the penalty. Rather than just run out of bounds, he slows down,\" Aikman protested. \"And that\u2019s been the frustration, and I get it. I understand it. That\u2019s been the frustration for these defensive players around the league.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the drive, Aikman said he \u201ccould not disagree\" more with the roughing penalty called on To'oTo'o and defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi, who smashed into each other and made incidental contact with Mahomes, who was underneath them after his late slide.",
      "When Martin announced the penalty, Aikman interjected, \u201cOh, come on!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a runner. I could not disagree with that one more, and he barely gets hit,\u201d Aikman said, noting that Mahomes shouldn't have been afforded the extra protections provided quarterbacks in the pocket once he started running on the play. \u201cThat\u2019s the second (questionable) penalty now that\u2019s been called against the Texans. \u2026 It was a late flag, and it was Clay Martin who threw it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gotta address it in the offseason,\u201d Aikman added.",
      "ESPN's rules analyst Russell Yurk concurred that no flag should have been thrown on the play.",
      "After the game, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans suggested his team expected the Chiefs to benefit from the officiating: \u201cWe knew going into today it was us versus everybody. And when I say everybody, it's everybody.\u201d",
      "Yurk also disagreed with a roughing-the-passer flag on Texans pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. in the first quarter that erased a three-and-out by Kansas City, which went on to score a field goal on that drive: \u201cIt looked like that first contact was to the upper chest area. I didn\u2019t see anything there that supported a foul,\u201d Yurk said.",
      "Martin, the referee, told a pool reporter after the game that on the Anderson penalty, \u201cI had forcible contact the facemask area,\u201d and on the To'oTo'o infraction, when the quarterback slides, \u201che is considered defenseless. The onus is on the defender. I had forcible contact there to the hairline, to the helmet.\u201d",
      "Walt Anderson, longtime NFL senior vice president of officiating who moved into a new role as the league's rules analyst and club communications liaison last year, said Sunday that both calls were correct under the current rules.",
      "Anderson said in an appearance Sunday on the NFL Network that it might be up for debate about whether there was forcible contact on the roughing-the-passer flag in the first quarter but emphasized that the league's rulebook calls for officials to throw the flag if there's any doubt whether roughing has occurred.",
      "As for the second foul, where Mahomes slid late, Anderson said the two Texans defenders who crashed into each other made incidental contact with Mahomes once he was on the ground, so replay assist couldn't be used in that circumstance to pick up the flag.",
      "Anderson noted that the league's competition committee could revisit either infraction and tweak the rules this offseason.",
      "Aikman, for one, would like to see the league crack down on flopping, as well.",

      "Coco Gauff has lost in the Australian Open quarterfinals to Paula Badosa 7-5, 6-4",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff's retooled forehand and serve abandoned her in the worst way and at the worst time at the Australian Open. The unforced errors just kept accumulating Tuesday, and so did the double-faults and break points, often followed by a palm placed over her eyes or a slap to a thigh.",
      "Add it all up, and Gauff's trip to Melbourne Park \u2014 and her 13-match winning streak that dated to late last season \u2014 ended in the quarterfinals. Never able to take control on a hot afternoon in Rod Laver Arena, the 2023 U.S. Open champion was eliminated by No. 11 Paula Badosa of Spain 7-5, 6-4.",
      "Using tweaks to some key strokes, and a change to her coaching team after a disappointing end to her title defense in New York in September, the 20-year-old Gauff arrived in Australia with hopes of earning a second Grand Slam title.",
      "\u201cI feel like (at the) U.S. Open, I was playing with no solution, so that was more the frustrating part. Today, I feel like I\u2019m playing with solutions; I know what I need to work on. U.S. Open, I needed to work on my serve. Not saying that my serve is where I want it to be, but I worked on it; obviously, a big improvement. So I want to continue working on that, continue working on playing aggressive,\u201d Gauff said.",
      "\u201cSo I feel like I\u2019m on the road to the right way, right path,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I lost today, I feel like I\u2019m in an upward trajectory.\u201d",
      "The American entered Tuesday with a 9-0 record in 2025; she also won her last four matches of last season to collect the trophy at the WTA Finals in November.",
      "\u201cJust a lot more work to do,\u201d Gauff said after the 1-hour, 43-minute loss to Badosa, who had been 0-2 in Grand Slam quarterfinals. \u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed, but I\u2019m not completely crushed.\u201d",
      "Badosa now heads to her first Grand Slam semifinal at age 27 \u2014 and less than a year after she was contemplating retirement because of a stress fracture in her back that took what felt like forever to heal and did not initially respond to cortisone injections.",
      "\u201cI wanted to (give) it a last try,\u201d Badosa said, \u201cWell, here I am. So I\u2019m really proud of what we went through with all my team and especially how I (fought) through all that, especially mentally.\u201d",
      "In Thursday\u2019s semifinals, she will go up against either her close friend, No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the two-time defending champion in Melbourne, or No. 27 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the runner-up at the 2021 French Open. Their quarterfinal was Tuesday night.",
      "No. 2 Alexander Zverev, a two-time finalist at other majors, was the first man into this year's Australian Open semifinals, getting there for the third time since 2020 by beating No. 12 Tommy Paul 7-6 (1), 7-6 (0), 2-6, 6-1. Paul was one point from taking the first set, then a point from taking the second, but couldn't close the deal, and Zverev was simply superior in the ensuing tiebreakers.",
      "Zverev faces the winner of the most-anticipated men's quarterfinal: Novak Djokovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "Djokovic, 37, is aiming for an 11th Australian Open trophy and a record 25th Grand Slam singles title overall. Alcaraz seeks to complete a career Grand Slam at age 21 by adding a championship in Australia to the ones he already owns: two from Wimbledon plus one apiece from the U.S. Open and French Open.",
      "Badosa was hurt during a practice at the tournament in Rome in May 2023, shortly after she began working with coach Pol Toledo. A year later, including several months off the tour, there still were issues.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the back was not responding. We couldn\u2019t find a solution. Paula was frustrated,\u201d Toledo said. \u201cI was like: This is not working. I don\u2019t know what we have to do.\u201d",
      "Relying on a new doctor, fitness coach and nutritionist, Badosa tried different exercises and supplements, and her back improved.",
      "\u201cThe puzzle,\u201d she said, \u201cstarted to look better.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, she kept the pressure on Gauff, who finished with 41 unforced errors, including six double-faults and 28 missed forehands. Badosa compiled 10 break points and won four of Gauff's service games. Gauff, meanwhile, never earned so much as a single break point until after already down a set and a break.",
      "One key game \u2014 and one that illustrated Gauff\u2019s problems on this afternoon \u2014 started the second set. It lasted 22 points spread over more than a dozen minutes, and Badosa converted her fifth break chance after Gauff missed two forehands in a row.",
      "Of Badosa\u2019s 12 points in that game, 11 came via mistakes by Gauff, including seven errant forehands.",
      "\u201cToday,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cshe did better in those key moments.\u201d",
      "When Badosa ended the quarterfinal with a forehand winner, she placed her hand over her mouth, then knelt on the ground and bowed her head. This was a big moment for someone who reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022, but only now believes she's reached her full potential.",
      "\u201cEmotionally, I wanted it so much,\u201d Badosa said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to feel freedom until I win the tournament. I\u2019m always like this. It\u2019s my personality. It\u2019s my character.\"",

      "Coyle converted a backhanded pass from Matt Poitras to make it 3-3 with about 12 minutes left in the game for his first goal since Dec. 27. He made it 4-3 four minutes later on a shot that bounced off goalie Yaroslav Askarov\u2019s pads and into the net.",
      "It was the second own goal for San Jose on the day: David Pastrnak\u2019s second-period score ricocheted off Sharks defenseman Jake Walman, who was standing at the top of the crease when the Bruins forward banked the puck into the net off his skates.",

      "Toronto made a play for Shohei Ohtani last year and was in the mix for Juan Soto before he joined the New York Mets in December. The Blue Jays also were reportedly one of the finalists for Roki Sasaki before the Japanese pitcher said he intends to sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",

      "Santander set career highs with 44 homers, 102 RBIs and 91 runs scored in 155 games for Baltimore last year. The outfielder batted .235 with a .506 slugging percentage while making the AL All-Star team for the first time.",
      "Santander, who turned 30 in October, was the majors\u2019 first switch hitter to reach 40 homers since 2006. He became the fourth switch hitter to hit at least 44 homers in a season, joining Mickey Mantle (twice), Lance Berkman and Chipper Jones.",
      "The Venezuelan slugger helped Baltimore get into the playoffs for the second straight year, but it was swept by Kansas City in the opening round.",

    "story": [
      "Ohio State can celebrate another title after holding off a Notre Dame comeback bid to walk away with a nailbiter of a 34-23 victory over the Fighting Irish",
      "ATLANTA -- The pass seemed to hang up there forever. Did it feel like seven weeks? Did it feel like 10 years?",
      "What a great debate for Ohio State fans to have forever.",
      "When that teardrop of a throw from Buckeyes quarterback Will Howard on third-and-11 finally landed, light as a feather, in the hands of receiver Jeremiah Smith late in the fourth quarter Monday, Ohio State had locked up what would be a 34-23 victory over Notre Dame for its sixth national title and first in a decade.",
      "It was that 56-yard gain that snuffed out a feverish Notre Dame comeback and made the Buckeyes the champion of the sport's first 12-team playoff, just as they were champions of its first four-team tournament a decade ago.",
      "\u201cThey were running man coverage and I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna let this loose and let him make a play on it,\u2019\u201d Howard said of a play that felt about 100 years removed from Ohio State's once program-defining \u201cThree yards and a cloud of dust.\u201d",
      "This was a win that hardly anyone thought possible a mere seven weeks ago \u2014 Nov. 30 \u2014 when a 13-10 loss to Michigan led to a near-riot on the field and questions over whether coach Ryan Day would keep his job when the calendar flipped.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great story about a bunch of guys who have just overcome some really tough situations, and at the point where there\u2019s a lot of people that counted us out (they) just kept swinging and kept fighting,\u201d Day said.",
      "It might be that much sweeter because of how it went down in a jam-packed stadium in the middle of SEC country that looked like a Christmas tree \u2014 Ohio State fans on one half in red, Notre Dame's on the other in green.",
      "Trailing 31-7, Notre Dame scored two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions to make it a one-score game late in the fourth quarter. The in-stadium camera found legendary Irish coach Lou Holtz in his luxury box, and he ignored all those booing Buckeye fans and flashed a thumbs-up.",
      "But Notre Dame's time was running out. After stopping the Buckeyes on their first two plays and using their timeouts, the Irish put Christian Gray \u2014 whose interception wrapped up Notre Dame's semifinal win over Penn State \u2014 in single coverage on Smith.",
      "Smith got behind Gray on the right sideline and Howard dropped his best pass of the season into the hands of the second-team All-American.",
      "It set up a field goal that started the celebration in earnest, and also helped Ohio State cover the 8 1/2-point spread at BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "\u201cIt was do or die, it was that type of down,\u201d Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a player. He\u2019s difficult to cover.\u201d",
      "Howard, a transfer-portal success story from Kansas State, threw for 231 yards and two scores, but nothing will beat the pass to Smith with everything on the line.",
      "The receiver, who had been bottled up by Texas in the semifinals then fairly quiet for most of this game, finally got loose for the kind of play he\u2019s been making all year. He finished with five catches for 88 yards.",
      "\u201cWe felt at the end we wanted to give Jeremiah that shot,\u201d Day said. \u201cWe really hadn't thrown it all night, but I thought, \u2018Know what, let\u2019s be aggressive, let's do this and lay it on the line.'\u201d",
      "Ohio State didn't really look like a team that needed to take risks after scoring touchdowns on its first four possessions, then adding a field goal on its fifth.",
      "When Quinshon Judkins (100 yards, 11 carries, three TDs), a transfer from Mississippi who highlighted Ohio State\u2019s judicious use of the ever-growing portal, busted a 70-yard run to set up the score that made it 28-7, this game looked over.",
      "It wasn\u2019t, and now Freeman will have to answer a few tough questions \u2014 one about the failed fake punt in the third quarter that turned into a field goal for a 31-7 lead; the other about sending Mitch Jeter in for a short field goal attempt while down 16 and facing fourth-and-goal from the 9. It might have looked like a better call had Jeter\u2019s kick not clanged off the left upright.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s still a two-score game, but you have a better probability of getting 14 points than you do 16 points,\u201d Freeman said.",
      "Really, though, Ohio State was the better team. The Buckeyes outgained Notre Dame 445 yards to 308. Howard completed his first 13 passes and never really got stopped. Ohio State punted a grand total of once.",
      "The Buckeyes rolled through four games in the new, expanded playoff \u2014 what great timing for Ohio State that the tournament swelled to a dozen teams in a year it didn't even play for the Big Ten title \u2014 by an average score of 36-21.",
      "Ohio State was seeded eighth, but the seedings were pretty much meaningless. The worse seed won every game in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, and the Buckeyes dominated in this title-game showdown of No. 7 vs. No. 8.",
      "It puts to rest, for now, any angst about that 13-10 Michigan loss in November \u2014 Ohio State\u2019s fourth straight in the series \u2014 that ended with a brawl after Wolverine players tried to plant a flag at midfield.",
      "The whole scene left a lot of folks, both in and out of Buckeye circles, thinking Day, in his sixth season, had outlived his usefulness on a campus that hadn\u2019t tasted a title in a decade.",
      "Instead, the Ohio State marching band can dot the \u201cI\u201d next time with the national-title trophy. And Day can join a list of title-winning coaches with Urban Meyer (2014) Jim Tressel (2002), Woody Hayes (\"Three yards and a cloud of dust\") and Paul Brown (who went on to become the namesake of the NFL's Cleveland Browns).",
      "Also, Day\u2019s .873 winning percentage coming into the game was third among coaches with 50-plus games \u2014 one spot behind none other than the Notre Dame legend Knute Rockne, himself.",
      "The Notre Dame loss means college football still has never had a Black coach win the national title. Freeman was trying to become the first.",
      "Instead, another kind of history. This marked the first time the Big Ten has taken back-to-back titles since 1942. Last year\u2019s champion was Michigan, which was sitting home watching this one, but still played a special role in a Buckeyes redemption story hardly anyone saw coming.",

      "Novak Djokovic has received the apologies he wanted from the Australian Open\u2019s local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic got the mea culpas he wanted from the Australian Open's local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air and so, according to tournament organizers, the 24-time Grand Slam champion is ready to concentrate on his quarterfinal showdown with Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cNovak acknowledges the apology has been given in public as requested,\" read a statement issued Monday by Tennis Australia, \"and is now moving on and focusing on his next match.\u201d",
      "That, perhaps, will draw a curtain on the bizarre off-court distraction as Djokovic pursues what would be an 11th championship at Melbourne Park and a record 25th major trophy overall.",
      "After winning at Rod Laver Arena on Sunday evening to set up the contest against No. 3 Alcaraz, Djokovic declined to do the customary post-match on court TV interview, but didn't immediately say why, eliciting some jeering from spectators. Only later that night, at his news conference, did Djokovic explain that he was taking a stand to protest comments made by Tony Jones on Channel 9 on Friday.",
      "Djokovic, a 37-year-old from Serbia, did not name Jones, but said a \u201cfamous sports journalist who works for official broadcaster Channel 9 ... made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments toward me.\u201d",
      "Jones called Djokovic overrated and a has-been and made what seemed to be a reference to when the player was deported from Australia in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "Djokovic added that he would continue to avoid speaking to the network without an apology from it and Jones.",
      "Those finally arrived on Monday.",
      "Nine Network said in a statement it apologized \u201cfor any offense caused from comments made\" while live on air.",
      "\u201cNo harm was intended towards Novak or his fans,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe look forward to further showcasing his Australian Open campaign at Melbourne Park.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on a TV show Monday, Jones said he intended his words as \u201cbanter\u201d and apologized to Djokovic \u201cif he felt that I disrespected him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI considered it to be humor, which is consistent with most things I do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHaving said that, I was made aware ... that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments. I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued an apology to them. And as I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak.\u201d",
      "Jones also offered words to Serbians.",
      "\u201cI do feel as though I\u2019ve let down the Serbian fans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying this to try and wriggle out of trouble or anything. I genuinely feel for those fans.\u201d",
      "Serbia\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, even got involved Monday, telling the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that Jones\u2019 comments were \u201cclearly unprofessional,\u201d including a \u201cmost concerning\u201d reference to what happened three years ago when Djokovic was kicked out of the country ahead of the tournament amid the pandemic.",
      "Before Jones and his employer offered their apologies, Djokovic posted a message on social media reiterating why he declined to speak. That drew a reply from billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s way better just to talk to the public directly than go through the negativity filter of legacy media.\u201d",
      "Djokovic replied to Musk's tweet with \u201cIndeed\u201d and a raised-hands emoji.",

      "Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday",
      "NANTERRE, France -- Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The Pacers know better. They will not be feeling right at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big crowd against us, honestly,\u201d Indiana guard Andrew Nembhard said.",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, for one 7-foot-4 reason. The upcoming NBA Paris Games \u2014 Indiana vs. San Antonio on Thursday and Saturday, the Pacers being the designated home team for the first matchup and the Spurs getting that distinction for the second game \u2014 are essentially going to be a weeklong celebration of France\u2019s own Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio\u2019s reigning NBA rookie of the year who likely will be an All-Star this season for the first time.",
      "In other words, welcome to Wemby Week in Paris.",
      "The teams arrived in Paris on Monday, with practices and other events scheduled throughout the week and then the games toward the end. The Spurs were coming straight from the airport to a light workout in Nanterre \u2014 the place where Wembanyama started his pro career in the French league as a 15-year-old.",
      "There have been single games in Paris in each of the last two seasons \u2014 Chicago-Detroit in 2023, Brooklyn-Cleveland last year \u2014 but this season, it\u2019s a two-game trip and Wembanyama is surely one of the reasons for that.",
      "Ticket demand was off the charts. The games sold out in a day. Some tickets remain as part of packages; for example, a game ticket for Thursday, including a chance to grab a picture with the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, will set you back $730. Flight not included, of course.",
      "Then again, not everyone in attendance will have bought their tickets. Wembanyama arranged a treasure hunt for 10 tickets; there were QR codes hidden in five cities \u2014 Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille and Bordeaux \u2014 and he encouraged fans to start hunting.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t come back to the capital without giving you the opportunity to come see me play,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "The Spurs are a global brand with deep ties to France that pre-date Wembanyama\u2019s arrival in San Antonio. Tony Parker and Boris Diaw helped the Spurs establish that relationship with France during their years in Spurs colors, and now the interest can be marked in plenty of ways off the court as well. Last week, the Spurs announced a series of events for this week in collaboration with Paris-Saint Germain, one of the world\u2019s most-followed soccer teams.",
      "\u201cWe have a long history with France for obvious reasons in many ways. So, it\u2019s just another milestone or opportunity, I think, to probably strengthen that bond or connection,\u201d Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cVery cool for Vic. Obviously, he just got done in the Olympics as well.\u201d",
      "France played host to the Paris Games last summer and Wembanyama helped his home nation get to the gold-medal game against the U.S. He was spectacular in the final, scoring 26 points. It wasn\u2019t enough, not with Stephen Curry leading the way with 24 for the Americans \u2014 capped by a barrage of four 3-pointers in the final couple of minutes to clinch the gold.",
      "Wembanyama settled for silver that night. The games this week are in the same arena as the Olympic final was. He was asked earlier this season how often he thinks about this trip and getting to play in Paris again.",
      "\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton was on that U.S. Olympic team. He knows what that arena felt like and can envision what it\u2019ll be like for Wembanyama\u2019s return this week.",
      "\u201cThe game has never seen anybody like him,\u201d Haliburton said.",
      "The Spurs played in Miami on Sunday and lost, then stuck around for a few hours to have some dinner and get their body clocks right for the 8-hour flight from South Florida to France. The Pacers were heading to do some sightseeing after landing Monday, including the Eiffel Tower.",
      "\u201cAll that good stuff,\u201d Pacers center Myles Turner said in a video released by the team.",
      "Paris has been waiting. And Wemby will be welcomed back like a conquering hero.",
      "\u201cI think any time anybody gets to play (or) perform back home, especially when that\u2019s not something you do consistently or regularly, it\u2019s a pretty cool opportunity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be people at the game that haven\u2019t seen him play in a long time or typically maybe never have. You know, hometown kids get to see you \u2026 maybe they\u2019ve never been to an NBA game. So, I know there\u2019s a lot of things, not to speak for him, that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s looking forward to and that are unique in a very, very cool way for him to connect.\u201d",

Someone who truly understood me and gave me a chance to lead, to be a captain. So much of my way of managing and being in a clubhouse came from him.\u201d",
      "Torborg was behind the plate for three no-hitters, the first with Koufax and the Los Angeles Dodgers for the perfect game against the Chicago Cubs in 1965. Torborg had the second in 1970 with Bill Singer for the Dodgers against Philadelphia, then in 1973 with the Angels caught the first of Nolan Ryan\u2019s record seven no-hitters in a game against Kansas City.",
      "After starring at Westfield High School and Rutgers University, Torborg spent 10 seasons in the majors as player \u2014 the first seven with the Dodgers and the last three with the Angels. He hit .214 with eight homers and 101 RBIs in 574 games.",
      "He began his managing career with Cleveland in 1977 at the age of 35 and was let go in 1979. He was with the White Sox from 1989-91 and also had stints with the New York Mets (1992-93), Montreal (2000) and Florida (2002-03). He was the AL manager of the year in 1990, leading the White Sox to 94 victories.",
      "\u201cRIP Jeff Torborg!\u201d former White Sox slugger Frank Thomas said on X. \u201cYou were my first big league manager and I enjoyed playing for you. You gave me a chance to shine right away and I\u2019m very thankful. God Bless the Torborg family.\u201d",
      "Torborg was a member of the Dodgers' 1965 championship team, but didn't appear in the World Series against Minnesota.",
      "Torborg also spent time as a broadcaster.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day to lose a great man with such high character,\u201d said Robin Ventura, who played for Torborg from 1989-91 with Chicago. \u201cHe was a family man who ran his team like a family. I smile as I think of him in the dugout wearing his soccer cleats as he managed his team.\u201d",
      "Torborg is survived by his wife of nearly 62 years, Suzie, sons Doug, Greg and Dale, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

      "Allen ran for two touchdowns and the Bills beat Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens 27-25 in a divisional game on Sunday. Mark Andrews dropped a pass from Jackson on a 2-point conversion that would've tied it with 1:33 remaining and Buffalo held on for the victory.",
      "The Chiefs have defeated the Bills three straight times in the playoffs, including the conference title game four years ago in Kansas City. But Buffalo was the only team to beat Kansas City's starters this season, a 30-21 victory at home in Week 11.",

      "The NFC East rival Eagles and Commanders will meet for the third time this season with each team winning at home. The Eagles beat Washington 26-18 in a Thursday night game on Nov. 14. The Commanders rallied for a 36-33 victory on Dec. 22 in a game where Hurts sustained a concussion in the first quarter.",

      "Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he is much more than that at home in Japan",
      "TOKYO -- Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he's much more than that in Japan.",
      "Back home, he's a wellspring of national pride, much like Shohei Ohtani now. His triumphs across the Pacific buoyed the nation as Japan's economy sputtered through the so-called lost decades of the 1990s and into the 2000s.",
      "\u201cHe healed the wounds in Japan\u2019s national psyche,\u201d Kiyoteru Tsutsui, professor of sociology at Stanford University, told The Associated Press.",
      "On Tuesday, he\u2019s expected to be the first Japanese player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and possibly only the second player chosen unanimously after New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.",
      "Ichiro debuted in Major League Baseball in 2001 with the Seattle Mariners, the first Japanese position player to span the Pacific and an instant star. Left-handed pitcher Hideo Nomo preceded him, and Hideki Matsui came just after, both boosting the country's confidence in a period of national malaise.",
      "Tsutsui termed Ichiro a \u201cgreat cultural export,\" akin to Hello Kitty, sushi, manga and others creations from Japan.",
      "\u201cIt may not be an exaggeration to say that Ichiro represents Japan's transition from the faceless economic animal to a producer of global cultural icons,\u201d Tsutsui said.",
      "Ichiro started playing baseball at age 7 on a Little League team near Nagoya in central Japan. Sure, baseball is baseball, but the culture around the game \u2014 known as \u201cyakyu\u201d (field ball) \u2014 is special.",
      "He was driven by his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki, and came up through what is often described as a regimented baseball-training system that some link to the martial arts and even samurai history.",
      "Ichiro grew to be hip in the majors, which fit the nation\u2019s branding as \u201cCool Japan.\u201d On the way, he bumped into pressure in Japan to conform, expressed in the saying \u201cderu kugi wa utareru.\u201d",
      "Roughly in English: \u201cThe nail that sticks up gets hammered down.\u201d",
      "\u201cYoung people flocked to watch him because they saw his do-it-my-way rebel spirit,\u201d William Kelly, emeritus professor of Japanese studies at Yale University, wrote in an email. \u201cOld fans were drawn to his seriousness of purpose and his force of concentration.\u2019",
      "Ichiro developed his unique swing very early, lifting his right leg and almost running to first base before hitting the ball. Repeatedly told in Japan to change it, he declined.",
      "His given name Ichiro \u2014 \u2019ichi\u201d means \u201cone\u201d in Japanese \u2014 started appearing on the back of his jersey in 1994 with the Orix BlueWave. Suzuki is a very common family name, and manager Akira Ohgi wanted to single out Ichiro for attention.",
      "\u201cI see Ichiro as an artist, a craftsman,\u201d said Shimpei Miyagawa, an assistant professor at Temple University in Japan. \u201cThe point is that Ichiro is someone who stands out in both singular talent and longevity in a game that is ironically played as a team sport.\u201d",
      "A Japanese, Miyagawa taught high school in Massachusetts and recalls students wearing Ichiro jerseys \u2014 in the heart of Boston Red Sox country.",
      "\u201cTo me that speaks volumes about the cultural breakthrough,\u201d Miyagawa said.",
      "Ichiro's games were shown live and on tape when be began playing with the Mariners.",
      "Nomo had a similar effect when he debuted with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. Ichiro topped that interest level, wrote Robert Whiting in his book \u201cThe Samurai Way of Baseball.\u201d",
      "\u201cIchiro was the first to appear front and center ever single day \u2014 a slender Japanese among pumped up musclemen, sparking big American teammates to victory \u2014 and the public could simply not get enough of this delectable sight,\" he wrote.",
      "Whiting wrote that few Japanese had seen much of Ichiro when he played in Japan for the BlueWave in the western city of Kobe.",
      "\u201cHis face adorned billboards all over Japan. Yet he nearly always played to half-empty stands, in games that were almost never telecast nationally.\u201d",
      "Ichiro will go into the Hall of Fame as professional baseball\u2019s all-time leader in hits with 4,367 (3,089 in MLB and 1,278 in Japan) \u2014 more even than Pete Rose's 4,256. He broke George Sisler\u2019s single-season hits mark of 257 in 2004. The new mark is 262.",
      "He played his last two games in 2019 in the Tokyo Dome against the Athletics, going 0 for 5 for the Mariners and then retiring at 45.",
      "\u201cI really wanted to play until I was 50,\u201d he said after his final game. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t do it. But it was a way of motivating myself. If I had never said that, I don\u2019t think I would have come this far.\u201d",
      "Ichiro made global news just over a year ago when he broke a window with a 426-foot home run while teaching students batting techniques at a Japanese high school.",
      "Much of Ichiro\u2019s early life is documented in the modest Ichiro Exhibition Room in his hometown of Toyoyama. It\u2019s situated in a residential area, a four-story, inconspicuous building; a shrine filled with Ichiro memorabilia.",
      "It\u2019s only open on the weekends and it\u2019s sure to become popular as this summer\u2019s Cooperstown induction nears. A marker guiding tourists to the office is graced with a silhouette of left-handed hitting Ichiro \u2014 his right leg raised as he begins his swing.",
      "Baseball was introduced into schools in Japan in 1872 by an American teacher, and many have used it to gauge the country\u2019s march toward modernization after centuries of isolation from the West.",
      "Ichiro's Hall of Fame enshrinement coincides with a surge of Japanese players shining in MLB. Ohtani is a singular talent in the history of the sport, and he was one of a dozen Japanese exports in the majors last season, including Yu Darvish, Shota Imanaga and $325 million Dodgers ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto.",
      "\u201cIchiro and Ohtani command so much respect from their peers and the public alike because they are focused on honing their crafts,\u201d Tsutsui wrote.",
      "Phenom pitcher Roki Sasaki, who announced Friday he's leaving Japan to join Ohtani on the Dodgers, continues the evolution.",
      "\u201cThe Hall of Fame vote caps that process,\u201d Tsutsui added. \u201cAnd many Japanese embrace the recognition that he is one of the greatest players to ever play in the Majors.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.",
      "\u201cIt's big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, adding that it's \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration.",
      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",

      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday to keep TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform\u2019s users even as national security questions persist.",
      "TikTok\u2019s China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump\u2019s order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has amassed nearly 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. Yet its 170 million U.S. users could not access TikTok for more than 12 hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised to pause the ban on Monday, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.",
      "Business leaders, lawmakers, legal scholars, and influencers who make money on TikTok are watching to see how Trump tries to resolve a thicket of regulatory, legal, financial and geopolitical issues with his signature.",
      "TikTok's app allows users to create and watch short-form videos, and broke new ground by operating with an algorithm that fed viewers recommendations based on their viewing habits. But concerns about its potential to serve as a tool for Beijing to manipulate and spy on Americans pre-date Trump's first presidency.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Courts ended up blocking the orders, but less than a year ago Congress overwhelmingly passed a law citing national security concerns to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold it to an approved buyer.",
      "The law, which went into force Sunday, allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline for ByteDance's divestment.",
      "Trump on Sunday said he had asked TikTok's U.S. service providers to continue supporting the platform and app while he prepared to sign an executive order to stop the ban for now.",
      "\u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social networking site.",
      "The law that Congress passed and now-former President Joe Biden signed in April allowed for a 90-day extension if there had been progress toward a sale before the statute's effective date. Less certain is whether that provision can be applied retroactively, according to Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cExecutive orders cannot override existing laws,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the new president has that authority to issue the 90-day extension of a law that\u2019s already gone into effect.\u201d",
      "Kreps also doubts the conditions for a delay exist at this point without so much as even a potential buyer being named to prove that a sale was moving along.",
      "But Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, has written that the law also empowers the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture\u201d \u2014 suggesting Trump could have discretion to say whether or when ByteDance meets the terms of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.",
      "Although ByteDance spent months repeating it wasn't interested in selling, Beijing on Monday also signaled a possible easing on China's stance on TikTok to allow it to be divested from its Chinese parent company. China\u2019s vice president held meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla tech titan Elon Musk on Sunday.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, said Monday that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Until now, it was widely believed that Beijing would not allow the sale of TikTok, which had come to embody China\u2019s defiance in the face of \u201cU.S. robbery.\u201d However, TikTok was among several issues brought up in a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump on Friday, though details were not available.",
      "Trump later announced plans to delay the TikTok ban and suggested a joint venture in which the U.S. would get a 50% ownership of the app. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s CEO, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government, so it\u2019s possible that Trump will direct the DOJ to ignore the law. Such a move might itself be subject to legal scrutiny but would buy time for TikTok.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to save TikTok may put him at odds with some of the House members and senators who voted for the law, which received broad bipartisan support. House Speaker Mike Johnson called ByteDance's ownership \u201ca very dangerous thing,\u201d and said he expected a full sale to happen.",
      "\u201cI think we will enforce the law,\u201d Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Legislators now stand to \u201clook a little bit silly\u201d if the ban doesn\u2019t last, Kreps said.",
      "\u201c(The case) becomes about the separations of powers, and checks and balances, that we don\u2019t have a king who decides what happens with the law,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cEnforcement isn\u2019t only up to the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a message posted on X, listed a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d Cotton noted.",
      "Despite the intense scrutiny and potential costs involved, the machinations over TikTok are in some ways just business as usual for the tech companies involved, according to Gus Hurwitz, a legal scholar with the International Center for Law and Economics.",
      "\u201cThe fines that we\u2019re talking about are civil penalties and companies risk civil penalties all the time,\u201d Hurwitz said.",
      "Still, the hard business calculus of complying with a law in limbo or risk defying a president who holds lucrative federal contracts over those companies could come into focus if shareholders sue.",
      "Oracle, for example, has a part of the Pentagon\u2019s $9 billion contract to build its cloud computing network.",
      "\u201cThis actually could be the right business decision to make,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a breach of duty to shareholders.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been lots of questions about how companies such as Oracle and Akamai Technologies are powering TikTok\u2019s servers to stay online, while others such as Apple and Google have made the app unavailable for new users to download.",
      "None of the companies have responded to requests for comment.",
      "Oracle in 2020 announced it had a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app\u2019s cloud technology provider.",
      "Meanwhile, as of Monday night, a search for TikTok on Apple\u2019s app store directs to an online statement that reads in part: \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,\u201d while Google\u2019s app store notes downloads for TikTok \u201care paused due to current US legal requirements.\u201d",

      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",

      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",

      "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app's savior.",
      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "TikTok content creators who make a living promoting their businesses and personal brands on the app were afraid that they would have to find new ways to engage consumers and make money as the app\u2019s future in the United States remained uncertain",
      "TikTok content creators who make a living promoting their businesses and personal brands on the app were afraid Sunday that they would have to find new ways to engage consumers and make money as the app's future in the United States remained uncertain.",
      "TikTok told U.S. users that it was beginning to restore service just hours after the popular video-sharing platform went dark in response to a federal ban, which President-elect Donald Trump said he would try to pause by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "Some users reported Sunday that the app was working again, but it remained unavailable for download in Apple and Google\u2019s app stores. Others remained locked out of accessing their profiles and the communities they had built online.",
      "Here's how content creators are reacting:",
      "On a typical morning, esthetician and social media personality Lee Zavorskas scrolls on TikTok while she sips coffee. Sunday morning was different \u2013 she scribbled a to-do list instead, which included playing with her cats and dog and plotting how to bolster her presence on other platforms like YouTube since TikTok went dark for her Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a 58-year-old content creator that found a seat at the table that\u2019s not available on Instagram,\u201d Zavorskas said.",
      "While Zavorskas has more followers on Instagram, she found a large crowd of people over the age of 40 on TikTok, making it easier to build her audience. She held out some hope that she would be able to return to the community she found on the app.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering your favorite food, and they\u2019re like, \u2018You know what? We took it away,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a Maryland-based content creator who owns small businesses, stopped posting on Twitter and Instagram and cut her advertising with Meta and Google out of frustration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s TikTok or nothing for me,\u201d she said.",
      "She thinks lawmakers unfairly punished TikTok for succeeding alongside its profitable competitors. And they played \u201cpolitical football\u201d with an app that millions of small businesses rely on to survive, she said.",
      "\u201cI spoke to small businesses in the last three days that have sobbed on my livestreams, afraid they\u2019ll have to lay their employees off tomorrow morning,\u201d Cianci said. \u201cThey are so afraid because they have other people\u2019s lives in their hands.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Watson, a 20-year-old beauty content creator, had been making videos since the days of Musical.ly, and was just starting to figure out the kind of content she was passionate about when TikTok went dark.",
      "\u201cThe community on TikTok is like nothing else, so it\u2019s weird to not have that anymore,\u201d she said.",
      "With spare time on her hands, Watson plans to focus on bolstering her presence on Instagram and YouTube. She also wants to devote more time to school as the psychology major and criminal justice minor prepares to graduate from Wingate University in North Carolina and enter \u201cthe real world.\" But being a content creator remains her \u201cmain dream,\" she said.",
      "If Trump lifts the ban, Watson plans to return to TikTok, but said she will \u201cprobably be more tuned into my YouTube since this ban has kinda spooked me.\u201d"

      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and too few have it under control",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",
      "Guidance from the American Heart Association urges would-be patients and experienced doctors to have \u201cthoughtful and informed discussions\u201d to decide who\u2019s a good candidate.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",

      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday.

      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",
      "Going viral on TikTok helped Ruben Trujillo market his Cafe Emporos Coffeegrams, a card that includes coffee, tea or hot chocolate. He said he\u2019s growing frustrated with the ever-evolving politics surrounding the ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like they keep putting the ball in each other\u2019s court, but who\u2019s going to make the decision?\u201d he said. He said small business owners are told to \u201cbe creative, pull yourself up by the bootstraps,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of people did that, and it\u2019s like those bootstraps are being cut now.\u201d",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sebastian Ray Serpa, a 16-year-old high school student from Volusia County, passes by Daytona International Speedway often and hears the roar of race cars from outside the gates but had never before been inside the \u201cWorld Center of Racing.\u201d",
      "After an immersive experience Friday designed for talented STEM students, Ray Serpa \u201cwill definitely\u201d be returning for next week's Rolex 24 at Daytona \u2014 his first ever motorsports event.",
      "IMSA arranged for 27 high school students who excel in STEM programs to come to the speedway to educate the teens on how many opportunities exist in motorsports for those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "Ray Serpa, who described himself as passionate about mechanical engineering, was blown away. He thought he'd like a future learning about how the human joint works. After stops at four different stations and a tour of the speedway and cars, he's now aware motorsports is an option.",
      "\u201cThis has been a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI knew that behind almost every concept out there there were opportunities, but I never realized how wide that actually went. There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",
      "It is the debut year for the program in IMSA sports car racing, but series president John Doonan ran a similar STEM experience when he was head of Mazda. It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future. We are going to do it at five other races this year and then have a web portal to allow the educators and students to follow up. For me it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d",
      "Doonan in his morning remarks to the students tried to prep them for what they were about to learn concerning STEM and motorsports.",
      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know. Most of them have never been to a race, so seeing this and what it looks like, and understanding there are plenty of things to pursue is just a wonderful gift for them.\u201d",

      "The field trip was designed to illustrate the challenges disabled researchers often face \u2014 and how barriers can be overcome.",
      "\u201cJust because you can\u2019t do it like someone else doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it,\" said Anita Marshall, a University of Florida geologist leading the outing. The group included scientists with sight, hearing and mobility disabilities.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about empathy, as much as it is about science,\u201d said Lepore, who also researches science education.",
      "Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation.",
      "Scientists with disabilities say that\u2019s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren\u2019t designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they can\u2019t work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation.",
      "The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, sets minimum regulations for new buildings and labs, including ramps and wheelchair-accessible walkways.",

      "At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up.",
      "The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.",
      "On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced advanced aviation, which began with the Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The aerospace sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",

      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "Suni Williams, the station's commander, had to tackle some overdue outdoor repair work alongside NASA's Nick Hague. Plans called for Williams to float back out next week with Butch Wilmore.",
      "Williams and Wilmore launched aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule last June on what should have been a weeklong test flight. But Starliner trouble dragged out their return, and NASA ordered the capsule to come back empty. Then SpaceX delayed the launch of their replacements, meaning the two won\u2019t be home until late March or early April \u2014 ten months after launching.",
      "It was the first spacewalk by NASA astronauts since an aborted one last summer. U.S. spacewalks were put on hold after water leaked into the airlock from the cooling loop for an astronaut's suit. NASA said the problem has been fixed.",
      "This was the eighth spacewalk for Williams, who has lived on the space station before.",

      "Blue Origin has launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Blue Origin launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight Thursday, sending up a prototype satellite to orbit thousands of miles above Earth.",
      "Named after the first American to orbit Earth, the New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida, soaring from the same pad used to launch NASA's Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft a half-century ago.",
      "Years in the making with heavy funding by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the 320-foot (98-meter) rocket carried an an experimental platform designed to host satellites or release them into their proper orbits.",
      "All seven main engines fired at liftoff as the rocket blazed through the predawn sky to the delight of spectators lining nearby beaches. Bezos took part in the action from Mission Control and Blue Origin employees erupted in cheers once the craft successfully reached orbit 13 minutes later, a feat that drew praise from SpaceX's Elon Musk.",
      "The first-stage booster missed its landing on a barge in the Atlantic, but the company stressed that the more important goal was achieved. Bezos said before the flight it was \u201ca little crazy\u201d to even try to land the booster on the first try.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\" Blue Origin\u2019s CEO Dave Limp said via X about reaching orbit. \"On to spring and trying again on the landing.\u201d",
      "For this test, the satellite was meant to remain inside the second stage while circling Earth. Plans called for the second stage to be placed in a safe condition to stay in a high, out-of-the-way orbit in accordance with NASA's practices for minimizing space junk.",
      "New Glenn was supposed to fly before dawn Monday, but ice buildup in critical plumbing caused a delay. The rocket is built to haul spacecraft and eventually astronauts to orbit and also the moon.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by Bezos, Blue Origin has been launching paying passengers to the edge of space since 2021, including himself. The short hops from Texas use smaller rockets named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard. New Glenn, which honors John Glenn, is five times taller.",
      "Blue Origin poured more than $1 billion into New Glenn's launch site, rebuilding historic Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The pad is 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the company's control centers and rocket factory, outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Blue Origin envisions six to eight New Glenn flights this year, with the next one coming up this spring.",
      "In a weekend interview, Bezos declined to disclose his personal investment in the program. He said he does not see Blue Origin in a competition with Musk\u2019s SpaceX, long the rocket-launching dominator.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s room for lots of winners\u201d Bezos said, adding that this was the \u201cvery, very beginning of this new phase of the space age, where we\u2019re all going to work together as an industry ... to lower the cost of access to space.\"",
      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA's Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency's successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Waltz made the comment when Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about a report from The Washington Post that said Trump was considering an executive order to suspend enforcement of a federal law that could ban the popular platform nationwide by Sunday.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "First enacted in 2011, the directive prohibited Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol officers from arresting suspected undocumented immigrants in a variety of locations.",
      "Schools and houses of worship were deemed off-limits, as were hospitals, funerals, weddings and public demonstrations.",
      "In a statement touting the move Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said law enforcement would use \"common sense\" in making arrests.",
      "\"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens -- including murders and rapists -- who have illegally come into our country,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" the statement continued. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "ICE can also now conduct immigration raids near courthouses, according to a memo obtained Wednesday by ABC News.",
      "The guidance is sharply different from the prior administration, which did not allow ICE to conduct enforcement operations at or near courthouses.",
      "\"ICE officers or agents may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action will take place,\" the memo sent to ICE employees said.",
      "The memo also said ICE should go after those who are in court for criminal proceedings and not civil matters, like in family court or small claims court.",
      "\"Additionally, civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses should, to the extent practicable, continue to take place in non-public areas of the courthouse, be conducted in collaboration with court security staff, and utilize the court building's non-public entrances and exits. When practicable, ICE officers and agents will conduct civil immigration enforcement actions against targeted aliens discreetly to minimize their impact on court proceedings,\" the memo said. \"ICE officers and agents should generally avoid enforcement actions in or near court-houses, or areas within courthouses, that are wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings (e.g., family court, small claims court).\"",
      "ICE will also change their terminology at Trump's direction, according to another internal memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "From now on, those they are arresting will be referred to as \"alien,\" as opposed to \"noncitizen,\" and those in the country illegally will be referred to as \"illegal alien,\" the memo said.",
      "\"ICE employees are directed to use the lexicon consistent with the immigration and nationality act and the language historically used by the agency,\" the memo said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration changed the language in 2021 when former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued terminology guidance.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:27:01 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump shattered the record for most executive orders signed on his first day in office.",
    "story": [
      "'It's all about common sense,\" Trump said of his executive actions.",
      "Armed with plenty of black Sharpies, President Donald Trump shattered the record for most executive orders signed on his first day in office and became the only commander-in-chief to partly do so in an arena packed with thousands of people.",
      "But the nation's 47th president is already facing legal challenges to some of his most controversial executive actions and others have stoked outrage.",
      "\"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech on Monday. \"It's all about common sense.\"",
      "With those words, Trump immediately began rescinding numerous executive actions taken by now-former President Joe Biden, alleging in a written preamble published with his presidential actions that \"the previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government.\"",
      "In another unprecedented move, Trump signed his first eight executive actions in front of a wildly enthusiastic crowd filling Washington D.C.'s 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, capping his inauguration parade.",
      "\"President Trump has really made political theater a core part of how he uses unilateral power,\" Jon Rogowski, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. \"He wants to make sure people know he has taken action that\u2019s consistent with the kinds of campaign promises that he made when he was running for office.\"",
      "What is an executive order?",
      "Executive orders are signed, official documents through which the president manages the operations of the federal government and provides instructions to the executive branch about how to interpret the law, Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington D.C., told ABC News.",
      "\"An executive order is a directive issued by the president that goes into the Federal Register. It has the force of law, but it does not require an act of Congress,\" Lichtman said. \"Although it has the force of law, it can be repealed by a subsequent president issuing executive orders of his or her own.\"",
      "Lichtman said that unlike laws passed by Congress, executive orders are more vulnerable to challenges in the courts, either substantive or procedural.",
      "\"The reason why we are seeing the government by executive order is twofold: Donald Trump was singularly ineffective in getting his agenda through Congress during his first term, even with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate during his first two years. The second reason is they have such a thin majority in the House,\" Lichtman said.",
      "In the past, executive orders were typically challenged after the federal government took action to implement them and someone claimed they had been harmed by that executive action, Rogowski told ABC News.",
      "\"Now, it has changed. Presidents are being sued immediately after they sign an executive order by organizations who represent collections of individuals or by states' attorneys general,\" said Rogowski.",
      "Rogowski said that during Trump's first term \u201cit became more common for groups and for states to directly challenge the president immediately upon the issuance of the directive with which they disagreed.\u201d",
      "\"Over the last decade, there\u2019s been more organization on the ground and among legal groups and states to put pressure on the presidential administration\u2019s use of executive action,\" Rogowski said.",
      "Trump's action prompt legal challenges",
      "Trump on Monday granted 1,500 people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol Building, \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon\" and commuted the sentences of 14 others involved in the riot. Trump called them \"hostages.\"",
      "The Constitution gives a sitting president the power to grant clemency to just about anybody and such actions cannot be reversed. Before leaving office on Monday, Biden issued a slew of preemptive pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including several close relatives, Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 Committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney.",
      "\"What they have done to these people is outrageous,\" Trump said while signing the pardons and commutations in the Oval Office.",
      "The pardons and commutations immediately sparked a backlash from both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"The president's actions are an outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement.",
      "Former Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., an ABC News contributor, called the pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters \"unsettling\" to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.",
      "\"They weren't 'hostages,' they were defendants. I was there,\" Katko told ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis on Monday night. \"A lot of people in the Capitol were beaten. I saw a lot of officers that were severely beaten and injured that night. It was a bad scene.\"",
      "Another controversial executive order Trump signed was one aiming to cut off birthright citizenship. Critics immediately pounced on Trump, arguing people born in the United States are granted citizenship under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment even if their birth parents migrated here illegally.",
      "Asked by reporters if he expected the order to prompt legal challenges, Trump responded, \"We'll see. We have very good grounds. People have wanted to do this for decades.\"",
      "Four federal lawsuits were filed already this week, challenging Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. One was filed in Massachusetts federal court by 18 Democratic state attorneys general, the city of San Francisco and the District of Columbia, accusing Trump of seeking to eliminate a \"well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle.\"",
      "Another federal lawsuit was brought by an undocumented expectant mother and two nonprofit groups, arguing the executive order is an attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to nearly every person born in the United States.",
      "\"This unprecedented attempt to strip citizenship from millions of Americans with the stroke of a pen is flagrantly illegal. The President does not have the power to decide who becomes a citizen at birth,\" the lawsuit argues.",
      "The lawsuit asks the Massachusetts District Court to declare the executive order unconstitutional and issue an injunction preventing it from being enforced.",
      "A similar federal lawsuit was filed by the states of Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. The American Civil Liberties Union also backed another lawsuit to block Trump's order in New Hampshire.",
      "\"We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU.",
      "In other executive actions, Trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border, saying, \"America\u2019s sovereignty is under attack.\"",
      "\"Our southern border is overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans, including America,\" the proclamation reads. \"This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.\"",
      "Trump also issued an executive order designating certain cartels as foreign terrorists. He signed yet another executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "Many of the proposed executive orders require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles.",
      "\"We have to relate as equals, not subordinates,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in reaction to Trump's executive orders pertaining to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum said her focus is on defending Mexicans and her country's Constitution.",
      "\"You have to keep a cool head with what he signed,\" Sheinbaum said. \"You have to read the decrees. In fact, we continue to study them because some of them went out very late at night and we have a team working on that.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said some of Trump's executive actions are similar to ones he signed during his first term, including the one proclaiming a national emergency at the southern border.",
      "\"There was cooperation between the two governments at that time,\" Sheinbaum said. \"When President Biden comes in, he removes it and now President Trump reinstates it.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Trump's executive action to prevent asylum seekers from entering the U.S. from Mexico is almost identical to the decree he made in 2018.",
      "As far as changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, Sheinbaum said, \"For us and the world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico.\"",
      "\"We will always act in the defense of our independence, the defense of our fellow nationals living in the U.S.,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We act within the framework of our constitution and laws. We always act with a cool head.\"",
      "Legal action could delay implementation of orders",
      "Rogowski said legal challenges could delay the executive orders from being put in place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to undermine the chances that any of these could have real, tangible consequences for people, but I suspect Trump is going to find it frustrating that many of his actions that he intends to have an immediate effect are instead going to be held up in court for weeks, months or even years, in some cases,\" Rogowski said.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days, suspended entry to the country of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prohibited any other refugees from coming into the country for 120 days. Rogowski noted that legal challenges stymied the so-called Muslim ban for 10 months and forced Trump to issue two revised versions of the ban before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it in a 5-3 ruling issued in June 2018.",
      "'A lot of them are symbolic'",
      "Trump also issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, alleging the organization mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As he did in his first term, Trump signed an executive order removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to mitigate climate change that was enacted in 2016. Trump said the agreement doesn't reflect U.S. values and directs \"American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\"",
      "Rogowski said some of the executive actions taken by Trump, like changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico and restoring the name of America's 25th president, William McKinley, to the highest peak in North America, are primarily \"symbolic.\"",
      "Rogowski said renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America \"is not going to advance any of Trump's economic goals or priorities that he outlines, other than make a symbolic change.\"",
      "Lichtman agreed, saying, \"They're symbolic in that they resonate with themes that Trump has been professing ever since he arrived in presidential politics a decade ago.\"",
      "But Lichtman added that many of Trump's executive orders \"are real and they have a real impact on the American people.\"",

      "Republican efforts to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from numbers used to divvy up congressional seats among states have begun anew, with four Republican state attorneys general suing to alter the once-a-decade head count even before President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office began Monday.",
      "Trump joined in the battle immediately upon returning to office, signing an executive order on Monday that rescinded a Biden administration order and signaled the possibility of a push by his new administration to change the 2030 census. Those efforts may get a boost from the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republican U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards from North Carolina earlier this month re-introduced legislation that would put a citizenship question on the census form.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed an order that would have excluded people in the U.S. illegally from being included in the 2020 census numbers used to allot congressional seats and Electoral College votes to each state. The GOP president also mandated in a second order the collection of citizenship data through administrative records. A Republican redistricting expert had written that using citizen voting-age population instead of the total population for the purpose of redrawing congressional and legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.",
      "Trump issued the memos after the U.S. Supreme Court blocked his earlier attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire. The high court said the administration\u2019s justification for the question \u201cseems to have been contrived.\u201d",
      "Both Trump orders were rescinded when President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the nation's largest statistical agency.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an open question about how much energy the administration and Congress will try to bend the statistical system to its will,\u201d historian Margo Anderson said about Trump's second term. \u201cNot because they wouldn\u2019t like to, but because there are other parts of the national government that they are more interested in.\u201d",
      "The Fourteenth Amendment says that \u201cthe whole number of persons in each state\u201d should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, health care and other programs.",
      "The lawsuit filed Friday by the GOP attorneys general of Kansas, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia seeks to exclude people in the country illegally or temporarily from the numbers used to apportion congressional seats. It claims that Ohio and West Virginia each unfairly lost a congressional seat and an electoral vote after the 2020 census because people in the U.S. illegally were included, and that each of the four states stands to lose a congressional seat and electoral vote after the 2030 census if that doesn\u2019t change.",
      "Projections released last month by Election Data Services don\u2019t show those four states losing seats after the 2030 census. The projections instead say California, New York and Illinois \u2014 states with Democratic majorities \u2014 are likely to lose the most seats and electoral votes.",
      "The Census Bureau on Tuesday didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Opponents of the citizenship question on the 2020 census said it discouraged participation by immigrants and residents who were in the country illegally, resulting in inaccurate figures. A Census Bureau simulation released in 2023 indicated that a significant number of noncitizens were missed in the count, which took place during the last year of the first Trump administration and at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Demographers and researchers expect the second Trump administration to change or reverse recent actions by the Biden administration related to U.S. statistical agencies. They include combining into a single question race and ethnicity questions that previously were asked separately on forms and adding a Middle Eastern and North African category.",
      "Many experts also expect planned questions about sexual orientation and gender identity on the most comprehensive survey of American life to be on the chopping block. Some have concerns that Trump will politicize the Census Bureau with large numbers of political appointees, with little experience, as happened during his first term. The Heritage Foundation's \u201cProject 2025\u201d policy guidebook for a Republican presidential administration advocated putting \u201ccommitted political appointees and like-minded career employees\u201d in bureau positions so they could \u201cexecute a conservative agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey could easily put in the same type of idiots they put in last time for political purposes,\u201d said Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate School and University Center, who is an expert on the census. \u201cI would assume that he will do what he tried to do before.\u201d",

    "summary": "With half the country firmly behind him and the blessing of America\u2019s tech billionaires, President Donald Trump is moving at a breakneck pace to try to remake America.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say Trump's show of power will need more backing to make it stick.",
      "With half the country firmly behind him and with the blessing of America's tech billionaires, President Donald Trump is moving at a breakneck pace to try to remake America.",
      "Using sweeping declarations of presidential power that go well beyond those in his first term, Trump has promised to upend how the federal government views the rights of migrants and trans people.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico will become the \"Gulf of America,\" he says. Alaska's Denali mountain peak will once again honor President William McKinley, who never visited but favored tariffs like Trump. And the 1798 law used to justify Japanese internment camps during World War II will be invoked, Trump promises -- this time, to go after foreign-born criminals, he said.",
      "Trump ordered an end to birthright citizenship too, even as many legal experts said that wasn't actually possible and opponents sued. But Trump insisted the 14th Amendment of the Constitution -- which grants citizenship to any person born inside the United States -- should now take into account the legal status of a person's birth parents.",
      "In yet another executive order, Trump suggested security clearances should be pulled from more than two dozen retired government intelligence officials who, just weeks before the 2020 election, challenged Republican narratives about emails purportedly found on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, calling them possible Russian propaganda. And TikTok was suddenly resurrected when Trump said its Chinese-based parent company could ignore for now a bipartisan law passed by Congress requiring it to sell the app or shut it down.",
      "To the public, Trump's unilateral flash of executive power might seem extraordinary. But history suggests it also could be short-lived without Congress and the courts behind it as opposition groups ready lawsuits, experts say.",
      "Marsha Barrett, a political historian and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said there's certainly precedent for presidents forcing change when Congress won't act, like when President Harry Truman ordered to desegregate the military.",
      "\"But relying so heavily on that power on the first day could be interpreted as an effort to demonstrate that the executive branch has eclipsed the congressional branch,\" Barrett said. \"While executive orders are undeniably an expression of sweeping presidential power, I think its application has a hollowness in comparison to presidents who executed much of their platform through Congress.\"",
      "In other words, without getting Congress firmly on board first, everything Trump declared on his first day in office can be undone just as quickly four years from now when he leaves office. There's also the question of how much of an impact it would have on government services Americans rely on.",
      "\"The proof is in the pudding and it is worth paying real attention to whether and how they execute on this vision,\" said Max Stier, founder and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.",
      "The federal government needs \"constructive reform,\" Stier added, \"not choices that will further erode the capabilities of our public institutions.\"",
      "Eight years ago, many of Trump's executive orders would have been likely been rebuked as \"un-American\" by critics like the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and decried by Democratic governors. But with the Republican party now firmly remade in his image, Trump arrived in Washington this week feted as any other politician might.",
      "Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, joined the new president his inauguration ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Elon Musk, the billionaire who heads Tesla, SpaceX and the social media site X, is said to be given an all-access pass to the White House as one of Trump's closest informal advisers.",
      "Also on Trump's side is a Republican-controlled House and Senate, as well as a U.S. Supreme Court with several of his own hand-picked justices who have shown they are willing to side with him in many instances.",
      "Democratic governors running states that swung behind Trump in the election also seemed to temper their criticism, at least for now.",
      "\"I stand ready to work with the Trump Administration to continue our progress here in Pennsylvania,\" said Gov. Josh Shapiro, once a top contender to serve in a Harris administration but is now up for re-election next year.",
      "\"At the same time, as I have done throughout my career, I will always defend our fundamental freedoms and stand up to efforts to erode them,\" he added, while also noting there is \"more that unites us as Americans than divides us.\"",
      "Nationwide, Trump won 49.9% of the popular vote, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris's 48.4%, according to final election returns. That means the new president will govern a country deeply divided on his leadership with many Americans wary, ambivalent or directly opposed to his final term as president.",
      "Soon after Trump's swearing in, liberal advocacy groups like Public Citizen, ACLU and Democracy Forward began filing lawsuits.",
      "To Trump though, his return to Washington signaled a new \"golden age\" as he insisted much of the country was solidly behind him.",
      "\"Nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours and our golden age has just begun,\" he said.",

The button was later updated to read \u201cGo To Home Page\u201d.",

      "The Spanish profile of the White House\u2019 X, @LaCasaBlanca and the government page on reproductive freedom also were disbanded. Meanwhile, the Spanish versions of other government agencies such as the Department of Labor, Justice and Agriculture remained available for users on Tuesday.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges. Trump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops to help support immigration agents and restrict refugees and asylum.",
      "According to 2023 Census Bureau estimates, about 43.4 million Americans \u2014 13.7% of the U.S. population age 5 and older \u2014 speak Spanish at home. The U.S. has no official language.",
      "Monica Rivera, a brand and communications strategist in New York City of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, said the shutdown sends a clear signal.",
      "\u201cThere are 43 million Latinos who speak Spanish as their first language and removing access to information directly from the White House draws a distinct line as to who they are serving and more dangerously, signals to the administration\u2019s MAGA base that we as Latinos are \u2018other\u2019 and a less significant part of this country,\" Rivera said.",
      "Anthony Hernandez, a paralegal in the nation's capital, wasn\u2019t initially aware of the move and said it suggests what the coming years of a second Trump presidency would look like, with specific issues making headlines while \u201cminor but equally malicious things like that go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA move like shutting down the Spanish White House page and X profile serves no purpose other than to cut off resources for millions of Hispanic Americans and immigrants attempting to enter the United States legally,\" Hernandez said. \"And it\u2019s a slap in the face to the millions of Hispanic voters that supported him in this recent election.\u201d",

      "Republicans in statehouses are emboldened by GOP electoral successes to push a new wave of bills to restrict transgender rights and gender-affirming care",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Republicans and Democrats in Kansas agree that concerns about the economy drove voters to support President Donald Trump by a 16% margin.",
      "They also know that ads from Trump and others targeting transgender rights resonated with voters. So while Kansas Republicans say property tax cuts are their top priority, they also are pushing to ban gender-affirming care for young people, including puberty blockers, hormones and, even though they are rare for minors, surgeries. They say that, too, resonates strongly with voters.",
      "\u201cIt carries so much more emotional weight,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Ron Bryce, a doctor from southeastern Kansas. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about children and our future.\u201d",
      "As lawmakers have gone into session in many states, Republicans are broadly emboldened by GOP electoral successes to continue pushing state-level bills to curtail transgender rights.",
      "As was the case in 2023 and 2024, dozens of bills are pending in mostly red-state legislatures aimed at issues such as which bathroom transgender people can use in public buildings, whether transgender people can use their gender identity on their driver's licenses and whether transgender girls can play on girls sports teams. In Texas alone, Republicans have filed more than 30 measures.",
      "Democrats are reckoning with voter backlash while not abandoning what they see as a civil rights issue.",
      "Kansas state Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat, said it\u2019s hard to conclude that Kansas voters favor transgender rights after Republicans picked up three state House seats and two state Senate seats.",
      "Republicans in the state think they\u2019ll be able to ban gender-affirming care for young people this year after previously failing because the added Republican members will allow them to override a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.",
      "\u201cTransgender people are going to be facing discrimination at the national level for four years,\" Carmichael said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m sure that some of my colleagues in the Kansas Legislature will try to find a way to one-up even what Donald Trump is doing.\u201d",
      "Trump, who made anti-transgender themes central to his campaign, signed executive orders on his first day in office Monday declaring that the federal government would recognize only two sexes: male and female.",
      "Federal prisons and shelters for migrants and rape survivors will be segregated by sex as defined by the order, and federal taxpayer money will not be able to be used to fund \u201ctransition services,\u201d which would appear to cover people incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "In the U.S., about 300,000 youths ages 13 to 17, or 1.4%, are transgender, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law. Among adults, the figure is 0.5%, for 1.3 million transgender Americans who are 18 or older.",
      "At the state level, legislators anticipate a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans on gender-affirming care are constitutional. The court heard arguments in December on a Tennessee law that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors. The justices appeared likely to uphold the law, though a ruling isn\u2019t expected until the summer.",
      "About half of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it\u2019s been about right, and a similar share said it hasn\u2019t gone far enough, according to AP VoteCast.",
      "Voters were split on at least one specific proposal. AP VoteCast found that slightly more than half of voters opposed laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for transgender minors, while a little under half were in favor.",
      "At least 26 states have banned or restricted gender-affirming care for people under 18.",
      "Harleigh Walker, a transgender 17-year-old high school senior in Alabama where the care is banned, said it\u2019s astounding that states are considering legislation that harms constituents like her. She said she\u2019s likely to leave the South for college, and her family is also considering moving.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not hurting anyone,\u201d Walker said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur existence and our right to healthcare, bathroom use, et cetera, it\u2019s not hurting anyone.\u201d",
      "Every major U.S. medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans and said gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence. Doctors, parents and young people have said such care reduces depression and suicidal thoughts in transgender youths.",
      "Conservatives nonetheless often describe the care as potentially harmful. Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins said lawmakers are trying to protect young people.",
      "\u201cChildren under the age of 18 are not equipped with the knowledge or maturity to make a decision that permanently affects the rest of their lives,\u201d he said in a newsletter earlier this month.",

      "Mo Jenkins, a 25-year-old transgender woman who ran unsuccessfully for a Texas House seat in Houston last year, described the possibility as terrifying. Her state banned gender-affirming care for minors in 2023.",

      "Leading candidates for the Democratic National Committee chairperson election said Tuesday's claim by front-runner Ken Martin that he has the support of 200 members is inflated and fails to paint an accurate picture of the dynamics of the race.",
      "Chair candidates need a simple majority of DNC members, or 225 votes, to win. If it holds, Martin's latest endorsement count would bring him close to victory on the first ballot.",
      "The role of the chair, who guides fundraising, recruiting and organizing efforts for Democrats nationally, holds particular importance in years when the party is outside of the White House and lacks a de facto leader.",
      "Whoever wins the election will have the responsibility of balancing messaging against the Trump presidency while looking to define and rebuild a party now marked by decisive losses in the executive branch and across both chambers of Congress.",
      "Typically, presidents appoint their own chairs to lead the parties they represent.",
      "Martin, the Minnesota Democratic Party chairman, announced his 200-member number in a statement Tuesday morning.",
      "\"I'm honored to have gained the support of leaders from across the country,\" Martin said. \"Our campaign is gaining momentum and we're going to continue to work hard for people's votes.\"",
      "The teams of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler claimed the dynamics of the race are far from locked.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Wikler's spokesperson claimed Martin is inflating his whip count in an attempt to create \"false momentum\" and \"lacks a clear path to victory.\"",
      "\"Ken Martin is releasing inflated whip counts because his momentum in this race has stalled and he is seeking to create a false sense of momentum,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our internal count has Ben within 30 votes of Ken, with a surge in support since last week's union endorsements. Ken has fewer votes than the combined support for Ben and Martin O'Malley and lacks a clear path to the majority.\"",
      "O'Malley's team swiped at Martin, claiming that the 200 figure is inflated and unsubstantiated. Pushing further than Wikler's team, O'Malley spokesman Chris Taylor told ABC News that \"not a single soul\" believes Martin, who he asserted is acting \"beneath the seriousness of this moment.\"",
      "\"This race isn't about inflated and unsubstantiated numbers or tricks and gimmicks,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"It's about making the changes we need to win and rebuilding the Democratic Party for the future of our Republic. There is not a single soul running for any DNC office who believes Ken Martin's count. It's disrespectful to the 448 voting members of the DNC -- many of whom are still making up their minds -- and beneath the seriousness of this moment.\"",
      "In their statements, O'Malley's and Wikler's teams both pointed to their internal numbers, which they said show a much closer race. None of the leading candidates have provided a full list of names of their supporters. O'Malley's team said it has commitments from 100 members. Wikler's team declined to offer its internal count.",
      "Even still, public endorsements for Martin seem to outnumber all others.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Martin's campaign has been rolling out daily endorsements on social media. His bid boasts the support of at least 50 current state party chairs and vice chairs, including party leaders from swing-states Arizona, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, and several members of Congress, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith and former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, as well as leaders of the Young Democrats of America.",
      "Wikler has the support from one of the highest-ranking Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and rubber stamps from both centrist and progressive organizations within the party. Last week, Wikler won the support of four powerful public sector unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.",
      "O'Malley has also been rolling out endorsements from individual members, including current and former members of the Congressional Black Caucus, alongside former mayors.",
      "The DNC has been hosting forums that function as debates between candidates for all officer positions. There are two left, one this week and one next week, a few days before the officer elections on Feb. 1.",

      "\"We have a commitment there,\" he said. \"Our national security promises can't be conditional based on who is in the Oval Office.\"",
      "VanDiver confirmed a Reuters report that nearly 1,660 Afghans cleared to resettle in the U.S. could have their flights canceled. As of Tuesday, the flights have not been canceled as the administration works through the order, which takes effect on Jan. 27.",

      "Tuberville went a step farther: \u201cI don't believe it because I didn't see it. Now, if I see it, I would believe it, but I didn't see in that video.\u201d",

      "\u201cI made very clear to you that I think that there's a difference between violent crimes and non-violent crimes. I do not support the pardons if they were given, if they were given to people who committed violent crimes, including assaulting police officers or breaking windows to get into the Capitol or other violent acts, pepper spray, for example,\u201d Collins said.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:09:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Public health experts say there could be massive implications after President Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.",
    "story": [
      "In his order, Trump accused the WHO of \"mishandling\" the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday evening withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, a move some public health experts say will put the nation at a major disadvantage.",
      "In the order, Trump accused the WHO of \"mishandling\" the COVID-19 pandemic, not adopting \"urgently needed reforms\" and being politically influenced by other member states.",
      "The president also said the withdrawal was about \"being ripped off.\"",
      "\"Everybody rips off the United States and that's it -- it's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said Monday night when asked by a reporter about his experience leading the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of the WHO to mount a global response to pandemics.",
      "The text of the executive order describes an \"unfair\" demand of \"onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "\"China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has 300 percent of the population of the United States, yet contributes nearly 90 percent less to the WHO,\" the executive order reads.",
      "Trump's executive order is an attempt to finish a process he began during the last months of his first term. The president temporarily slashed funding and signed an executive order in July 2020 removing the U.S. from the WHO but, because withdrawal requires a one-year notice, former President Joe Biden reversed the decision upon taking office in January 2021.",
      "Public health experts who spoke to ABC News said they worry the withdrawal from the WHO will put the U.S. at a disadvantage when it comes to responding to health crises at home and abroad.",
      "\"The U.S. withdrawal from the WHO is really disappointing news. It's a strategic mistake in so many ways for us as a country,\" Dr. Daniele Fallin, dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta, told ABC News.",
      "\"Not being part of the WHO means not only do we threaten the health of Americans and our fellow humans across the globe, but we also lose our stature as a leader in global health, and I'm very concerned about that,\" she added.",
      "Here's what experts said would be the implications of the U.S. leaving the WHO:",
      "U.S. could miss early warning signs of disease",
      "Removing the U.S. from the WHO could hamper efforts to address current public health issues, such as bird flu, the experts said.",
      "Human cases have been diagnosed across the country since April 2024, with 67 confirmed as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The CDC and other public health officials say there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low. However, federal health officials have prepared millions of vials of an available bird flu vaccine as a precautionary measure, in case it becomes necessary.",
      "Last year, the WHO announced it had launched an initiative to help accelerate the development of a human bird flu vaccine using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.",
      "No longer being part of the WHO could mean losing the ability to collaborate on disease preparedness and response, as well as the ability to exchange information about emerging threats to public health, the experts said.",
      "The U.S. also majorly contributes to the WHO's work, including collaborations with the CDC and the National Institutes of Health on issues including cancer prevention and global health security.",
      "\"I think about the WHO as a network of countries around the world that inform and protect each other when health issues are emerging, whether they're health issues entering into the United States, or whether the health issue is going outside the United States,\" Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey, told ABC News. \"And so, it is disadvantageous for people, and is disadvantageous for the United States, [who need] access to relevant, timely, important information.\"",
      "U.S. could play lesser role in responding to global health crises",
      "WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to the withdrawal announcement in a statement early Tuesday morning, expressing \"regret\" to hear the news.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats,\" his statement read, in part. \"Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and benefited from membership in WHO.\"",
      "Public health experts said not being part of the WHO when those initiatives were being conducted -- and, in some cases, are still being conducted -- would have been detrimental to making progress at home and abroad.",
      "Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the think tank Council on Foreign Relations, described the executive order removing the U.S. from the WHO as \"an enormous mistake.\"",
      "He said he's worried because it comes at the same time as another executive order Trump signed putting a 90-day pause on all foreign aid spending.",
      "\"Many U.S. global health programs fund the ongoing treatment of individuals for malaria or for HIV/AIDS,\" he told ABC News. \"A 90-day pause could be significantly disruptive to the operation of those programs, and it is not entirely certain how the strategy review that will occur during that time will affect global health programs moving forward.\"",
      "\"The WHO is not a perfect institution, but it plays an irreplaceable role in global outbreak response and, by withdrawing this action, reduces the ability of the United States to positively influence that response to outbreak. It makes Americans less safe,\" Bollyky added.",
      "Tesla CEO and tech billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump tapped to head the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), responded to the WHO's statement on X with a kiss-face emoji on Tuesday morning.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:10:34 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Refugees who'd been approved to travel to the United States before a Jan. 27 deadline suspending America\u2019s refugee resettlement program have had their travel plans canceled by the Trump administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Refugees who had been approved to travel to the United States before a Jan. 27 deadline suspending America's refugee resettlement program have had their travel plans canceled by the Trump administration.",
      "Thousands of refugees are now stranded at various locations around the globe.",
      "The suspension was in an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Monday. It left open the possibility that people who had undergone the lengthy process to be approved as refugees and permitted to come to the U.S., and had flights booked before that deadline, might still be able to get in under the wire.",
      "But in an email reviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press, the U.S. agency overseeing refugee processing and arrival told staff and stakeholders that \u201crefugee arrival to the United States have been suspended until further notice.\u201d",
      "Among those affected are the more than 1,600 Afghans cleared to resettle in the U.S. as part of the program that the Biden administration set up after the American withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. That number includes those who worked alongside American soldiers during the war as well as family members of active-duty U.S. military personnel.",
      "Trump's order had given the agency until Jan. 27 before it began to halt all processing and traveling. Now, however, it appears the timing in the order was moved up. It was not immediately clear what prompted the change.",
      "Refugees are distinct from people who come directly to the U.S.-Mexico border with the goal of eventually seeking asylum in the U.S. Refugees must be living outside of the U.S. to be considered for resettlement and are usually referred to the State Department by the United Nations.",
      "They undergo extensive screening before coming to the U.S. Once in the U.S., they are usually paired with a resettlement agency that helps them adjust to life in America. That includes help finding a job and get their children enrolled in school."

    "title": "Trump rescinds Biden's executive order on AI safety in attempt to diverge from his predecessor",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 09:46:27 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Hours after returning to the White House, President Donald Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing former President Joe Biden\u2019s guardrails for the fast-developing technology",
      "Hours after returning to the White House, President Donald Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing former President Joe Biden\u2019s guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "But what comes next from Trump and how it will diverge from how his predecessor sought to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy and even some of Trump's most enthusiastic tech industry supporters aren't so sure.",
      "\u201cI think that the previous order had a lot in it,\u201d said Alexandr Wang, the CEO of AI company Scale, describing Biden's 2023 executive order on AI as overly lengthy but declining to name what about it was harmful. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to comment on each individual piece of it. There\u2019s certainly some parts of it that we strongly agree with.\u201d",
      "Wang, who traveled to Washington to attend Trump's inaugural festivities, is also optimistic that better things are yet to come. He and other Silicon Valley leaders who previously worked with the Biden administration have embraced Trump and hope to guide his approach toward one with fewer restrictions.",
      "In its early days, Trump's team has already \"set the tone for a very productive administration with a lot of deep collaboration between industry and government,\" Wang said.",
      "Much of Biden's order set in motion a sprint across government agencies to study's AI impact on everything from cybersecurity risks to its effects on education, workplaces and public benefits. That work is done.",
      "\u201cThe reports have been written and the recommendations generated, and they\u2019re available for everyone to build on,\u201d said Alexandra Reeve Givens, CEO of the nonprofit Center for Democracy & Technology. \u201cThe executive order's work is completed, whether or not it\u2019s rescinded.\u201d",
      "Those reports are helping to inform the private sector as well as federal agencies and state governments, she said.",
      "Not only that, but much of the standard-setting established by Biden's order followed the path of earlier AI executive orders signed by Trump in his first term that carried over into the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cIf you look past the kind of political positioning on this, the Biden executive order built upon themes that were established in the first Trump administration and have been reiterated by bipartisan voices in Congress,\u201d she said.",
      "One key provision of Biden's AI order that was still in effect until Monday was a requirement that tech companies building the most powerful AI models share details with the government about the workings of those systems before they are unleashed to the public.",
      "In many ways, 2023 was a different time in the AI discourse. ChatGPT was a novelty and Elon Musk \u2014 long before he became a close adviser to Trump \u2014 had called for a moratorium on advanced AI development. Biden's own worries were amplified after watching the Tom Cruise film \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d in which the world is threatened by a sentient and rogue machine, according to his then-deputy chief of staff.",
      "The executive order followed public commitments to the Biden administration from tech companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI welcoming third-party oversight.",
      "But the order went further in invoking the Defense Production Act, which dates from the Korean War, to compel companies to share safety test results and other information if their AI systems met a certain threshold.",
      "Little is known publicly about how those confidential exchanges worked in practice, but the government scrutiny was heavily criticized last year by some Trump backers such as the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who also sits on the board of Facebook parent Meta Platforms.",
      "Andreessen said over the summer that he was concerned with \u201cthe idea that we\u2019re going to deliberately hamstring ourselves through onerous regulations while the rest of the world lights up on this, and while China lights up on this.\u201d",
      "Trump is following through with a campaign promise to rescind Biden\u2019s AI order. His campaign platform described it as hindering AI innovation and imposing \u201cRadical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology,\u201d tying it to broader concerns from Musk and other Trump allies about \u201dwoke AI\" chatbots reflecting liberal biases.",
      "But the Biden order itself didn't restrict free speech. Some provisions sought standards for the watermarking of AI-generated content, part of a strategy to reduce the dangers of impersonation and abusive sexual deepfake imagery. The order also directed multiple federal agencies to guard against potential harms of AI applications, warning against irresponsible uses that \u201creproduced and intensified existing inequities, caused new types of harmful discrimination, and exacerbated online and physical harms.\u201d",
      "One former White House science adviser who helped craft Biden's rights-based AI approach described Trump's action as a \u201cpolitically motivated repeal with no thoughtful replacement.\"",
      "Trump's move signals that he is \u201cless supportive than the Biden administration of issues around privacy, around people\u2019s civil liberties and civil rights and just concerns around safety more broadly with regards to advanced systems,\u201d said Alondra Nelson, the former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.",
      "Addressing those concerns is important for people to adopt the AI tools that businesses are developing, added Nelson, now a fellow at the Center for American Progress.",
      "\u201cAmericans have some of the highest rates of mistrust of AI in the developed world,\u201d she said, citing surveys.",
      "Some of Biden's AI moves are still in place, at least for now, such as a year-old AI Safety Institute focused on national security. Trump also hasn't yet weighed in on Biden's bigger conflict with the tech industry \u2014 pending rules restricting AI chip exports to more than 100 countries in an effort to counter China's backdoor access to them in places such as the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia.",
      "Nor has Trump repealed Biden's most recent AI executive order \u2014 a week-old action that seeks to remove hurdles for AI data center expansion in the U.S. while also encouraging those data centers to be powered with renewable energy.",
      "Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for AI data centers and electricity infrastructure to power them, through a new partnership called Stargate formed by ChatGPT maker OpenAI along with Oracle and SoftBank. At a press conference, he didn't seem familiar with Biden's latest AI order but said he wouldn't rescind it.",
      "\u201cThat sounds to me like it\u2019s something that I would like,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see federal lands opened up for data centers. I think they\u2019re going to be very important.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration, according to a memo to the entire workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "The memo, written by acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, also instructs the Justice Department\u2019s civil division to help identify state and local laws and policies that \u201cthreaten to impede\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s immigration initiatives and potentially challenge them in court.",
      "Prosecutors shall \u201ctake all steps necessary to protect the public and secure the American border by removing illegal aliens from the country and prosecuting illegal aliens for crimes\u201d committed in U.S. jurisdiction, the memo says. It directs prosecutors to investigate for potential criminal charges cases in which state and local officials obstruct or impede federal functions.",
      "\u201cFederal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,\u201d the memo says. \u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution.\"",
      "The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, with prosecutors told in no uncertain terms that they will be on the front lines of an administration-wide effort to crack down on illegal immigration and border crime and that they are expected to carry out the policy vision of President Donald Trump's Republican White House when it comes to violent crimes, the threat of transnational gangs and drug trafficking.",
      "\u201cIndeed, it is the responsibility of the Justice Department to defend the Constitution, and accordingly, to lawfully execute the policies that the American people elected President Trump to implement,\u201d Bove wrote in the memo obtained by the AP.",
      "\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s responsibility, proudly shouldered by each of its employees, includes aggressive enforcement of laws enacted by Congress, as well as vigorous defense of the President\u2019s actions on behalf of the United States against legal challenges,\" Bove added. \u201cThe Department\u2019s personnel must come together in the offices that taxpayers have funded to do this important work.\u201d",
      "The memo also says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove, a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to charge a lower-level offense.",
      "\u201cThe most serious charges are those punishable by death where applicable, and offenses with the most significant mandatory minimum sentences,\u201d Bove wrote.",
      "It is common for Justice Departments to shift enforcement priorities under a new presidential administration in compliance with White House policy ambitions. The memo reflects the constant push-and-pull between Democratic and Republican administrations over how best to commit resources to what officials regard as the most urgent threat of the time.",
      "The edict to charge the most readily provable offense, for instance, is consistent with directives from prior Republican attorneys general including John Ashcroft and Jeff Sessions, while Democratic attorneys general including Eric Holder and Merrick Garland have replaced the policy and instead encouraged prosecutorial discretion."

      "A poll finds many U.S. adults support the idea of beefing up security at the southern border and undertaking some deportations",
      "WASHINGTON -- Many U.S. adults are on board with the idea of beefing up security at the southern border and undertaking some targeted deportations, according to a poll. But as President Donald Trump begins his second term with a series of sweeping executive orders on immigration, the findings suggest his actions may quickly push the country beyond the limited consensus that exists on the issue.",
      "There is a clear desire for some kind of action on U.S.-Mexico border security, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Half of U.S. adults think increasing security at the border should be a high priority for the federal government, according to the poll, and about 3 in 10 say it should be a moderate priority. Just 2 in 10, roughly, consider it a low priority.",
      "The vast majority of U.S. adults favor deporting immigrants convicted of violent crimes, and the Trump administration's deportation efforts may begin there. But Trump's initial executive orders have gone far beyond that \u2014 including efforts to keep asylum-seekers in Mexico and end automatic citizenship.",
      "And Trump, a Republican, is continuing to signal an aggressive and likely divisive approach, with promises to deport millions of people who entered the country illegally while declaring a \u201cnational emergency at our southern border.\u201d About 4 in 10 American adults support deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and a similar share are opposed.",
      "Most Americans think local police should cooperate with federal immigration authorities on deportations in at least some cases, but implementation could quickly become unpopular. On Tuesday, the Trump administration threw out policies limiting arrests of migrants in sensitive places like schools and churches, even though a shift to such arrests would be largely unpopular.",
      "Immigration was a key issue in the 2024 election, and the poll indicates that it's still a high priority for many Americans as Trump takes office.",
      "Illegal border crossings soared under Trump's predecessor, President Joe Biden, with border arrests from Mexico reaching a record-high of 250,000 in December 2023. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of an immigrant invasion, crossings have plunged since then, amid increased Mexican enforcement and the Democratic Biden administration\u2019s June 2024 order that dramatically limited asylum claims at the border.",
      "But memories of those rising numbers, and the chaos that ensued when migrants were bused by Republican governors to northern cities, may have helped shape American attitudes. The survey found that about half of Americans think the government is spending \u201ctoo little\u201d on border security, and the vast majority favor deportations of people who have been convicted of violent crimes.",
      "\u201cI want to see more people coming here legally,\u201d said Manuel Morales, a 60-year-old Democrat who lives near Moline, Illinois. He first came to America by crossing the border illegally from Mexico nearly 40 years ago. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m against all these caravans coming (to the border), with thousands and thousands of people at one time,\u201d said Morales, a technician for an internet provider.",
      "He\u2019s deeply sympathetic to migrants who come to the U.S. to escape repression or poverty and feels that too many Americans don\u2019t understand the yearslong efforts required to enter the U.S. legally. Yet, he also believes the number of migrants has simply become too great in the past few years.",
      "\u201cWe cannot just receive everybody into this county,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump rarely gives specifics when he calls for mass deportations, but the survey indicates many Americans are conflicted about mass roundups of people living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Removing immigrants who are in the country illegally and have not committed a violent crime is highly divisive, with only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults in support and slightly more than 4 in 10 opposed.",
      "And relatively few Americans, about 3 in 10, somewhat or strongly favor changing the Constitution so children born in the U.S. are not automatically granted citizenship if their parents are in the country illegally. About 2 in 10 are neutral, and about half are somewhat or strongly opposed.",
      "Doug DeVore is a 57-year-old Republican living in southern Indiana who believes that immigration \u201cwent haywire during the Biden administration.\u201d",
      "But the idea of large-scale operations to check people's immigration status makes him uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t be 100% against it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s that fine line\" between gathering information on people living in the U.S. illegally and automatically deporting them, added DeVore, who works in a candy factory.",
      "As the Trump administration prepares to attack sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, the poll finds that the vast majority of U.S. adults think police in their community should cooperate with federal immigration authorities to deport people who are in the country illegally in at least some cases.",
      "Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the local police should never cooperate with federal law enforcement on these deportations.",
      "There's a divide, though, on whether cooperation should happen across the board or if it should happen only sometimes. About two-thirds of Republicans say local police should always cooperate, a view that only about one-quarter of Democrats share. But relatively few Democrats say local police should never cooperate and most, about two-thirds, say cooperation should happen in some cases.",
      "And a wave of arrests could quickly spark a backlash, depending on how they happen. U.S. immigration agents have long abided by guidance that deters arresting parents or students at schools and other sensitive places, but some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric has raised questions about whether those policies will persist.",
      "The poll finds that a shift toward arresting people in the country illegally at places like churches and schools would be highly unpopular. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults somewhat or strongly favor arresting children who are in the country illegally while they are at school, and a similar share support arresting people who are in the country illegally while they are at church. Solid majorities, about 6 in 10, oppose these kinds of arrests.",

      "Parched Southern California could get some badly needed rain this weekend to dampen the prospects of another round of deadly wildfires",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Parched Southern California was forecast to face more dangerous winds on Wednesday but could get some badly needed rain this weekend, dampening the prospects of another round of deadly wildfires though even a small amount of precipitation could could create new challenges like toxic ash runoff.",
      "Los Angeles officials were preparing for that prospect even as a small number of residents were allowed to return to the devastated Pacific Palisades and Altadena areas and firefighters quickly controlled small blazes that broke out.",
      "\u201cWe're going to see another round of critical fire conditions across Southern California,\u201d Todd Hall, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said in an interview Wednesday morning. \u201cAt this point it sounds like a broken record.\u201d",
      "Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order Tuesday to expedite cleanup efforts in burn areas and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. She ordered crews to remove vegetation, shore up hillsides, install barriers and reinforce roads ahead of the possible weekend rain, which could create mud and debris flows.",
      "\u201cThis is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,\u201d Bass said during a news conference.",
      "Los Angeles County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.",
      "A 60% to 80% chance of a small amount of rain was forecast for Southern California starting Saturday, with most areas likely getting not more than a third of an inch (0.8 centimeters), according to Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist for the weather service\u2019s office for Los Angeles. However up to an inch (2.5 centimeters) could fall in localized thunderstorms, which would be a worst-case scenario if enough to trigger debris flows on scorched hillsides.",
      "\u201cBut even if the rain doesn\u2019t materialize this time, it could be a good practice run for those communities because this will be a threat that they\u2019ll have to deal with for months or years,\u201d Kittell said.",
      "Fire crews were filling sandbags for communities.",
      "In 2018, Montecito, a town 80 miles (130 kilometers) up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge wildfire. Twenty-three people died, and hundreds of homes were damaged.",
      "Winds eased somewhat Tuesday afternoon after peaking at 60 mph (96 kph) in many areas, but gusty conditions were expected to return the next two days. Red flag warnings for critical fire risk were extended through 8 p.m. Thursday in LA and Ventura counties.",
      "\u201cOur concern is the next fire, the next spark that causes the next wildfire,\u201d said David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Another worry was that the two major blazes, the Palisades and Eaton fires, could break their containment lines as firefighters continue to keep watch for hot spots.",
      "Fire engines and water-dropping aircraft allowed crews to swiftly douse several small blazes that popped up in LA and San Diego counties, officials said.",
      "Evacuation orders were lifted for the Friars Fire, which broke out near a San Diego mall, and partially for the Lilac Fire, which burned through dry brush after threatening some structures, Cal Fire said. Nearby crews fully contained the Pala Fire, another small blaze. The Clay Fire in Riverside was 40% contained Tuesday night and evacuation orders were lifted.",
      "Southern California Edison preemptively shut off power to more than 60,000 customers in five counties to prevent new fires from being sparked by winds toppling electrical equipment; electricity was later restored to some. The utility was considering precautionary shutoffs for an additional 160,000 customers.",
      "Authorities urged residents to review evacuation plans, prepare emergency kits and be on the lookout for fires and report them quickly.",
      "Bass also warned that winds could carry ash and advised Angelenos to visit the city's website to learn how to protect themselves from toxic air during the latest Santa Ana wind event.",
      "The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong winds came as firefighters continued to battle the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out Jan. 7. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 63%, and the Eaton Fire was at 89%.",
      "The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the causes of the fires but has not released any findings.",
      "Several lawsuits have been filed by people who lost their homes in the Eaton Fire, alleging Southern California Edison equipment sparked the blaze. On Tuesday a judge overseeing one of the lawsuits ordered the utility to produce data from circuits in the area where the fire started.",
      "President Donald Trump, who criticized the response to the wildfires during his inaugural address Monday, has said he will travel to Los Angeles on Friday.",

They are accused of mistreating four of the five children, all of whom are Black. Whitefeather and Lantz, who are white, each face more than a dozen felony counts that include forced labor, civil rights violations, human trafficking and gross child neglect.",

      "Nassau County Supreme Court Judge Bruce Cozzens on Tuesday denied a request by the Long Island Roller Rebels to prevent Nassau County from enforcing its ban while its lawsuit is considered by the court.",
      "In July, local lawmakers in the suburban county east of New York City banned transgender women and girls from playing on female sports teams at the county's roughly 100 parks and recreational facilities.",
      "The judge determined the new law does not exclude transgender women and girls from public facilities based on their gender identities as they can still play in coed sports leagues. He said allowing transgender women to play in female sports creates additional risk of injury and potential liability for the local government.",
      "\u201cThere can be no question (even without discovery) that a biological male regardless of transitioning would be possessed of greater athleticism and speed, strength, muscle mass, stronger hearts and greater bone density,\" Cozzens wrote. \"The goal of the local law is to provide a safe environment for individuals who are born female to play.\u201d",
      "The roller derby league and the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on the league's behalf, said they were disappointed by the ruling and intend to appeal it while their litigation proceeds.",
      "Gabriella Larios, a staff attorney for the NYCLU, called the judge's ruling an \u201coutlier\u201d that is inconsistent with other court decisions, and state laws protecting human rights and civil rights.",
      "\u201cAt a time of rising anti-LGBTQ+ hate and violence across the country, keeping this ban intact is not only cruel, but it is also dangerous,\u201d added Amanda \u201cCurly Fry\u201d Urena, president of the Roller Rebels. \u201cWe hope that New York\u2019s courts will ultimately strike down this unlawful ban and acknowledge it for what it is \u2014 transphobic and unjust.\u201d",
      "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, in a statement, applauded the decision and called it \u201ccommon sense.\u201d",
      "The Republican had initially imposed the ban through an executive order last February, but that was struck down by the court after the roller derby league and NYCLU challenged it.",
      "The county\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature then passed a local law to enshrine the ban, prompting the latest round of litigation, which also includes a legal challenge from Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "\u201cThey have a competitive advantage,\u201d Blakeman said, referring to transgender athletes. \"It\u2019s unfair, and it\u2019s also unsafe.\u201d",
      "The ruling comes after President Donald Trump, on his first day in office Monday, signed an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people. The order, among other things, declares that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female."

Its members stress its diplomatic nature and broad focus on regional issues, including infrastructure, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, climate change and maritime security.",

      "The strategic element to the Quad has prompted China to accuse the four countries of attempting to form an \u201cAsian NATO,\u201d though it is a very different construction and has no mutual-defense pact, a key component to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance.",

      "Last week in his confirmation hearing, Rubio called China \u201cthe most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\"",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Rubio made his first appearance at the State Department as secretary of state and called on U.S. diplomats to forcefully defend and execute Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies.",
      "\u201cThe voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy on a very clear mission,\u201d Rubio told them.",
      "\u201cAnd that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest, which (was) clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous. And that will be our mission, that will be our job.\u201d",
      "Trump has been publicly skeptical of the value of the State Department since his first term in office and, as he has done with other agencies, accused some in the diplomatic corps of working to blunt or derail his policy priorities.",
      "Rubio paid tribute to the men and women of the State Department, calling them \u201cthe greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world.\u201d",
      "But, his arrival came amid a wave of resignations \u2014 demanded by Trump\u2019s team \u2014 of career diplomats from senior positions in the State Department bureaucracy and U.S. embassies around the world.",
      "The full extent of the resignations sought by the incoming administration remained unclear on Tuesday but began in earnest on Friday when a large number of career diplomats holding politically appointed posts, such as undersecretaries and assistant secretaries of state, were told to resign. On Monday, the demand for resignations grew to include career diplomats serving as ambassadors as well as lower-ranking staffers."

      "\u201cNothing like this has happened before in the 17 years I\u2019ve been with Multnomah County,\u201d Elections Director Tim Scott told the AP in an email. A contractor has been hired to measure the windows, with hopes to replace them by next week, he said.",
      "The county\u2019s security team is working with Portland Police to investigate, officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, police are still investigating an attack on a ballot box in October. An incendiary device was set off, destroying ballots about a week before Election Day. The early morning fire was extinguished quickly thanks to a suppression system inside the box. Two more fires in ballot boxes in Vancouver, Washington, damaged hundreds of ballots during the 2024 election.",
      "The devices were made of a \u201c very volatile mix\u201d of thermite and scrap metal, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations."

      "But northerners build certain tips into their everyday lives, from dressing in layers to trying not to panic if your car begins to slide.",
      "When approaching a stop, for instance, \u201cbrake much sooner than you normally would, and just start easing into that stop in case sliding will occur \u2014 because it probably will on ice,\u201d says Brock Carlson, owner of Let's Get Rolling Driving School in northern Minnesota.",
      "He and other experts have some common-sense measures anyone can take to guard against this week's extreme winter weather. The winter blast has brought unusually cold temperatures and rare snow that's coated New Orleans landmarks and even beaches along the Alabama and Mississippi coastline.",

      "Newborn puppies, small dogs, senior dogs and breeds with short hair are particularly vulnerable to hypothermia, according to the American Kennel Club. Warning signs of hypothermia in dogs include rapid breathing, followed by slower and shallower breaths; sluggishness and delayed reflexes. Curling up for warmth or shivering are among the first signs their owners might notice.",

It might be a good idea to double the distance for when you begin to break.

      "Officials have summoned more than 200 potential jurors to a Georgia courthouse where a former prosecutor will stand trial on charges she meddled with police investigating the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery",
      "BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- More than 200 potential jurors were summoned Tuesday to a Georgia courthouse to face questions about whether they can serve impartially in the trial of a former prosecutor accused of meddling with police as they investigated the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Jackie Johnson served as district attorney when Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased by three white men in pickup trucks and fatally shot on a residential street. Johnson's misconduct trial will be held in the same courthouse where Arbery's assailants were convicted of murder in 2021.",
      "Officials summoned a large pool of potential jurors given the notoriety of Arbery's killing and Johnson's public profile during her decade as the top prosecutor in coastal Glynn County.",
      "Superior Court Clerk Rebecca Walden said her office mailed out jury duty notices to 500 people. More than 200 had filled out and returned juror questionnaires, she said. Some others were excused from jury duty, or their mailings were returned as undeliverable.",
      "Potential jurors will be asked what they've read or heard about Arbery's killing and the case against Johnson, and whether they're able to serve as impartial jurors. Walden said she suspects it could take a week to select a jury of 12 members plus alternates.",
      "Greg McMichael, a retired investigator for Johnson's office, started the pursuit with his son Travis McMichael on Sept. 23, 2020, after Arbery ran past his home just outside the port city of Brunswick. Travis McMichael killed Arbery with a shotgun at point-blank range as a neighbor who joined the chase, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, recorded the shooting on his cellphone. The men later said they wrongly suspected Arbery was a thief.",
      "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr's office is prosecuting Johnson. Prosecutors say she abused her office by trying to shield the McMichaels, who along with Bryan avoided arrest for more than two months until the shooting video leaked online.",
      "The Georgia Bureau of Investigation then took over the case from local police. All three men were arrested, convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. They were also found guilty of federal hate crimes in a separate 2022 trial.",
      "Johnson was indicted in September 2021 on a charge of violating her oath of office, a felony punishable by one to five years in prison, and a misdemeanor count of hindering police as they investigated Arbery's death. The indictment says Johnsons showed \u201cfavor and affection\u201d toward Greg McMichael and interfered with police by \u201cdirecting that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest.\u201d",
      "Johnson has denied wrongdoing, insisting she immediately handed the case to an outside prosecutor because of her connection to Greg McMichael. She was voted out of office in November 2020, a defeat she largely blamed on controversy over Arbery's death.",

      "In the Texas capital, two people died in the cold weather, according to a statement from the city of Austin. No details were provided, but the city said emergency crews had responded to more than a dozen \u201ccold exposure\u201d calls. Officials said one person died from hypothermia in Georgia.",
      "Snow covered the white-sand beaches of normally sunny vacation spots, including Gulf Shores, Alabama, and Pensacola Beach, Florida. The heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain hitting parts of the Deep South came as a blast of Arctic air plunged much of the Midwest and the eastern U.S. into a deep freeze.",
      "A powdery South made for some head-turning scenes \u2014 a snowball fight on a Gulf Shores beach, sledding in a laundry basket in Montgomery, Alabama, pool-tubing down a Houston hill.",
      "One of the country\u2019s quirkiest cities, New Orleans, didn\u2019t disappoint under the snowy spotlight. There was an attempt at urban skiing along Bourbon Street; a priest and nuns in a snowball fight outside a suburban church; snowboarding behind a golf cart; and sledding down the snow-covered Mississippi River levees on kayaks, cardboard boxes and inflatable alligators.",
      "High school teacher David Delio and his two daughters glided down the levee on a yoga mat and a boogie board.",
      "\u201cThis is a white-out in New Orleans, this is a snow-a-cane,\u201d Delio said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had tons of hurricane days but never a snow day.\u201d",
      "The nuns at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic School near New Orleans encouraged their students last week to pray to saints, including Our Lady of the Snows \u2014 a devotional term for Mary, mother of Jesus \u2014 for the snow day they received Tuesday, said the Rev. Tim Hedrick. The priest said he invited the nuns to make snow angels, and they challenged him to a snowball fight that has since received tens of thousands of views on social media.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun way to show that priests and sisters are humans, too, and they can have fun,\u201d Hedrick said.",
      "It has been more than a decade since snow last fell on New Orleans. With more than 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow in parts of the city Tuesday, New Orleans has far surpassed its record \u2014 2.7 inches (6.8 centimeters) on Dec. 31, 1963 \u2014 according to the National Weather Service. There were unofficial reports of 10 inches (26 centimeters) of snow in New Orleans in 1895, NWS meteorologist Christopher Bannan said.",
      "For Houston, the winter blast marks the latest dramatic fluctuation in extreme weather. Hurricane Beryl devastated the city in July, killing dozens and knocking out power to large swaths of the city. Several months later, a winter storm has dumped the most snow in decades over the Houston area.",
      "Nearly 2,000 flights to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with about 10,000 others delayed, according to online tracker FlightAware.com. Both Houston airports suspended flight operations starting Tuesday. Nearly every flight was cancelled at New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport, but most airlines planned to resume operations Wednesday.",
      "Alvaro Perez was hunkering down at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston on Tuesday after his flight to El Salvador was canceled. His new departure is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just ride it and stay here,\u201d Perez said.",
      "Ahead of the storm, governors in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and even Florida \u2014 the Sunshine State \u2014 declared states of emergency and many school systems canceled classes Tuesday. School closures were planned in some coastal communities in North and South Carolina.",
      "The NWS said up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of snow fell in the Houston area. Texas transportation officials said more than 20 snowplows were in use across nearly 12,000 lane miles in the Houston area, which lacks its own city or county plows.",
      "Forecasters say snowfall could stretch from north Georgia, through Atlanta, and into southern portions unaccustomed to such weather.",
      "Parts of the Florida Panhandle were coated white Tuesday. Tallahassee, Florida\u2019s capital, last saw snow in 2018 \u2014 just 0.1 of an inch (0.25 centimeters), according to the weather service. Tallahassee's highest snowfall on record was 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) in 1958.",
      "\u201cBelieve it or not, in the state of Florida we\u2019re mobilizing snowplows,\u201d said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "Mobile, Alabama, hit 5.4 inches (13.7 centimeters) and counting Tuesday, topping the city\u2019s one-day snowfall record of 5 inches (12.7 centimeters), set Jan. 24, 1881, and nearing its all-time snowfall record of 6 inches (15.5 centimeters) in 1895, the weather service said.",
      "The blizzard warning in effect until midday Tuesday was the first issued by the office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, according to meteorologist Donald Jones.",
      "Louisiana transportation agency workers worked through the night to prepare bridges and roadways. Nonetheless, Louisiana State Police said they have already responded to more than 50 crashes Tuesday, and pleaded for people to stay home.",
      "This latest cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped at the North Pole.",
      "Frigid cold persisted across the eastern two-thirds of the country as the East Coast was blanketed in snow while people from the Northern Plains to the tip of Maine shivered in bitter cold. The NWS said normal temperatures would return slowly by the end of the week.",
      "A state of emergency was declared in at least a dozen New York counties with up to 2 feet (60 centimeters) of lake-effect snow and extreme cold expected around Lake Ontario and Lake Erie through Wednesday.",
      "Wind chills are expected to reach minus 30 F to minus 50 F (minus 34 C to minus 46 C) across the Dakotas and into the Upper Midwest through Friday, the NWS warned. Subzero wind chills were forecast from the Central Plains eastward through Wednesday night.",
      "In Southern California, where blazes have killed at least 27 people and burned thousands of homes, dry conditions and strong Santa Ana winds remained a concern.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A second day of ferocious winds were forecast for Tuesday in Southern California where firefighters remained on alert and extreme fire weather raised the risk of new wildfires two weeks after two major blazes still burning in the Los Angeles area sparked.",
      "Gusts could peak at 70 mph (113 kph) along the coast and 100 mph (160 kph) in the mountains and foothills during extreme fire weather that is expected to last through Tuesday morning.",
      "The National Weather Service issued a warning of a \u201c particularly dangerous situation \u201d for parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Diego counties from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds.",
      "\u201cThe conditions are ripe for explosive fire growth should a fire start,\u201d said Andrew Rorke, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.",
      "On Monday, Los Angeles fire crews quickly put out a small brush fire that broke out south of the iconic triple-domed Griffith Observatory. A man suspected of starting the fire was taken into custody, said David Cuellar, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Firefighters also quickly extinguished a brush fire along Interstate 405 in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Granada Hills that temporarily closed the northbound lanes.",
      "Farther south, fire crews aggressively fought a blaze that also sparked Monday afternoon in the city of Poway, in San Diego County, and stopped its forward progress.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, and her husband Doug Emhoff, flew to Los Angeles after attending President Donald Trump's inauguration and met with firefighters, volunteers and victims of the Eaton Fire in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe just came out to thank (firefighters), to thank the community and just remind folks that we're all in this together,\u201d Harris said. She said their home in Pacific Palisades was still standing.",
      "Trump, who criticized the response to the wildfires during his inaugural address, has said he will travel to Los Angeles on Friday.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday said the devastation left by the blazes underscores the need for partnership between the state and federal governments.",
      "\u201cI look forward to President Trump\u2019s visit to Los Angeles and his mobilization of the full weight of the federal government to help our fellow Americans recover and rebuild,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "A small amount of rain is forecast for the weekend in the Los Angeles area, though more gusty winds are expected to return Thursday, Rorke said.",
      "Authorities urged people not to mow their lawns to prevent sparking a fire, nor start any fires that could get out of control. They also urged residents to review their evacuation plans and ready emergency kits and be on the lookout for any new blazes and report them quickly.",
      "David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the biggest concerns are the Palisades and Eaton Fires breaking their containment lines and a new blaze starting.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,\u201d Acuna said.",
      "The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on Jan. 7. The Palisades fire was 61% contained early Tuesday and the Eaton fire 87% contained, according to fire officials.",
      "More evacuation orders were lifted Monday for Pacific Palisades and authorities said only residents would be allowed to get back in after showing proof of residency at a checkpoint. Over the weekend, two men impersonating firefighters attempted to enter an evacuation zone for the Palisades Fire, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday the city was prepared for any possible new fires and warned the strong winds could disperse ash from existing fire zones across Southern California. She urged Angelenos to visit lacity.gov to learn about ways to protect themselves from toxic air during Santa Ana winds.",
      "Cal Fire and local fire departments have positioned fire engines, water-dropping aircraft and hand crews across the region to enable a quick response should a new fire break out, Acuna said.",
      "Acuna said Cal Fire had extra fire crews in Kern and Riverside counties.",
      "Los Angeles fire officials said the department has all available engines ready and that 30 of them had been positioned in fire risk areas. The agency also ordered the outgoing shift of about 1,000 firefighters to remain on duty to staff the extra engines.",
      "\u201cThe pre-deployment is very, very thoughtful and strategic,\u201d Crowley said."

However the plan calls for a broad reassessment and overhaul of U.S. trade policy.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending all U.S. foreign assistance programs for 90 days pending reviews to determine whether they are aligned with his policy goals.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much assistance would initially be affected by the Monday order as funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress and is obligated to be spent, if not already spent.",
      "The order, among many Trump signed on his first day back in office, said the \u201cforeign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values\u201d and \u201cserve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.\u201d",
      "Consequently, Trump declared that \u201cno further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing last week that \u201cevery dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions:",
      "\u201cDoes it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?\u201d he said.",
      "The order signed by Trump leaves it up to Rubio or his designee to make such determinations, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development are the main agencies that oversee foreign assistance.",
      "Trump has long railed against foreign aid despite the fact that such assistance typically amounts to roughly 1% of the federal budget, except under unusual circumstances such as the billions in weaponry provided to Ukraine. Trump has been critical of the amount shipped to Ukraine to help bolster its defenses against Russia's invasion.",
      "The last official accounting of foreign aid in the Biden administration dates from mid-December and budget year 2023. It shows that $68 billion had been obligated for programs abroad that range from disaster relief to health and pro-democracy initiatives in 204 countries and regions.",
      "Some of the biggest recipients of U.S. assistance, Israel ($3.3 billion per year), Egypt ($1.5 billion per year) and Jordan ($1.7 billion per year) are unlikely to see dramatic reductions, as those amounts are included in long-term packages that date back decades and are in some cases governed by treaty obligations.",
      "Funding for U.N. agencies, including peacekeeping, human rights and refugee agencies, have been traditional targets for Republican administrations to slash or otherwise cut. The first Trump administration moved to reduce foreign aid spending, suspending payments to various UN agencies, including the U.N. Population Fund, and funding to the Palestinian Authority.",
      "However, the U.S. previously under Trump had already pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, with its financial obligations, and has been barred from funding the the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, by a bill signed by former President Joe Biden last March."

Only three defendants remain on federal death row after Democratic President Joe Biden recently converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",

      "Trump's order comes days after Garland withdrew the Justice Department's protocol for federal executions that allowed for single-drug lethal injections with pentobarbital, after a government review raised concerns about the potential for \u201cunnecessary pain and suffering.\u201d The protocol could be imposed by Trump's new acting Attorney General James McHenry III, or his his pick to lead the Justice Department, Pam Bondi, once she's confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The pentobarbital protocol was adopted by Bill Barr, attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, to replace a three-drug mix used in the 2000s, the last time federal executions were carried out before Trump was in office.",

Industry estimates indicate that vacant office space has nearly doubled since the pandemic, a quarter of dry-cleaning businesses have shut down, and the number of golf games played during the working week has risen 350% - suggesting some people are mixing work and pleasure.",
      "Working from home is rapidly becoming a major battleground in the culture wars. The government is currently legislating to strengthen the right of employees across the UK to request working from home and says that it intends to make it harder for employers to turn down requests.",
      "But some employers - including government bodies - are battling with staff to get them back into the office, arguing that face-to-face interaction is essential to collaborative working.",
      "In some cases, such as independent record label Hospital Records, this requires negotiation between a young workforce - some of whom may never have worked full-time in an office - and their older bosses.",
      "Company founder Chris Goss, who introduced a new policy requiring staff work three days in the office rather than two, said he had \"a nagging feeling\" that remote working has affected the company's bottom line.",
      "\"I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships, and so the one single way for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person.\"",
      "Maya, a 25-year-old marketing manager at the company, said she likes being around her more experienced colleagues in the workplace. \"There's a lot of people in my team that are a lot further along in their career, so if I need help with something, you know, I can just ask someone.\"",
      "But she believes she would not be able to be in the office five days a week \"because my social battery drains and I need sometimes to be just at home and just to smash out loads of admin\".",
      "Prof Bloom, a Stanford University economist, said his research into working from home suggests employees in their teens and early 20s should probably be in the office at least four days a week to maximise their opportunities for being mentored.",
      "However, he said polls of tens of thousands of employees in the UK, US and Europe suggest workers valued the ability to work from home for two days a week about as much as an 8% pay rise.",
      "Employment rights minister Justin Madders told Panorama there was a growing body of evidence that working from home was more productive. He also said it was good for growth because companies will have \"a much more motivated workforce\" and \"if we're able to get more people into work because flexibility is available for them, that will help us reach our growth ambitions\".",
      "Prof Bloom may not be as optimistic about the effect hybrid working has on productivity, but he does agree that increasing the number of roles which can be done from home could help with economic growth if it encourages more people back into work, such as those with caring responsibilities.",
      "\"That is a huge boost\" and \"kind of a win, win, win\", because people would be able to work in better conditions, contribute to tax revenue and \"everyone gains\".",
      "One of the people who could benefit is Harleen, who was made redundant after she had her second child and has been unable to return to work because she cannot find a fully remote role that fits around her autistic son's routine.",
      "\"I am not seeing those jobs advertised. I'm not seeing anything that caters to that flexibility,\" she said.",
      "\"Every day I wake up and I'm thinking I'm living in Groundhog Day. All I'm doing is being a mother. I enjoy being a mum, but I want productivity. I start to feel like I'm just being brain dead.\"",
      "In the public sector, productivity is the lowest it has been since 1997 - except for the pandemic lockdown years - and some blame working from home. Since November 2023, civil servants have been called back in for between two to three days a week.",
      "But in several public bodies, including at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in Newport, South Wales, some staff are refusing to return.",
      "Ed, an IT delivery manager at the ONS and a rep for the PCS trade union, said he has worked almost entirely from home since the pandemic. He says it helps him to get his children to school and nursery and not waste time on commuting.",
      "\"We've never been told by senior leaders at the ONS that there is a problem with productivity, there's a problem with quality, there's a problem with meeting deadlines,\" he said.",
      "\"We will never see this opportunity again. We have to fight for workers' rights.\"",
      "He and other union members are threatening to strike if they are forced to travel into the office 40% of the time. Civilian staff in the Metropolitan Police and union members at the Land Registry are also in dispute over policies on returning to the office.",
      "The ONS, which is in talks with the union, says it believes \"face-to-face interaction\" helps to \"build working relationships, supports collaboration, and innovation\".",
      "But whatever the outcome of disputes such as this, it is clear that all of us working full-time in the office is now a thing of the past."

    "story": [
      "The humble sandeel is set to take centre stage in the first courtroom trade battle between the UK and EU since Brexit.",
      "The UK has banned European vessels from catching the silvery fish species in its North Sea waters to protect marine wildlife that depend on it for food.",
      "But the EU is challenging the move, arguing it discriminates against Danish vessels that fish sandeel commercially, breaching the post-Brexit trade deal.",
      "The dispute is now heading for a three-day trade tribunal hearing, after formal talks to resolve the wrangle failed.",
      "Without a last-minute compromise, it will mark the first time the two sides have gone to arbitration under the 2021 trade agreement agreed by Boris Johnson.",
      "UK's puffin protection laws at centre of post Brexit row",
      "Challenge to fishing ban a threat to seabirds - RSPB",
      "The case is due to be heard from Tuesday next week at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a dispute resolution body based in the Hague, by a panel of three mutually-agreed international trade judges.",
      "They could uphold the UK's position - or order the UK to change or drop its ban, in which case Brussels could ultimately retaliate with tariffs on British exports if ministers refused to comply.",
      "Under the trade deal, a final ruling must be delivered by the end of April, although it could be issued earlier. There is no right to appeal.",
      "It comes as the UK prepares for tricky negotiations with the EU over new catch limits from June next year, when current arrangements under the trade deal run out.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is also hoping to persuade EU leaders to strike new deals in areas such as security and food trade, as part of a wider \"reset\" in relations with the UK.",
      "Environmental plaudits",
      "Sandeel, a group of small eel-like fish species, is a jointly managed fish stock under the trade deal. It is not caught for culinary reasons and is unlikely to be found on restaurant menus in European capitals.",
      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",
      "But the dispute will be watched closely for how the judges balance the UK's right to take conservation measures with economic rights.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:07:03 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham, Southampton and Bradford. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "Donald Trump is expected to target undocumented immigrants, most of whom come from Central America, as soon as he takes power next week. What is lesser known is that migrants from some of the same countries have a legal route to work on American farms for a limited time.",
      "Farm labourer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz is happy.",
      "She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California.",
      "\"They paid us $19 (\u00a315.60) an hour,\" says Sandra. \"We were asked to pick seven boxes per hour, and if we picked more, then we got paid a bit extra.",
      "\"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\"",
      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",
      "It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez.",

      "\"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\"",
      "This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.",
      "Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas.",
      "\"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says.",
      "When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers.",
      "Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\"",
      "While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank.",

      "A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back.",
      "And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

      "Cottrell-Boyce, whose books include Millions and Cosmic, will warn that while children in the UK may fare well in reading league tables, reading for pleasure is in decline, leading to \"less chance of [them] being happy\".",

      "\"That our children seem to be experiencing some kind of happiness recession at the moment is not surprising, and I believe that the decline in reading has played its part in this.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of his speech, the writer emphasised the benefits of help with reading in early years. \"It's easy to get depressed about the situation, but there's a huge amount of happiness and optimism to be drawn on,\" he said.",

      "Actor and director Justin Baldoni has released out-takes from a romantic scene in his film It Ends With Us, which he says is evidence that his co-star Blake Lively's allegations of sexual harassment are unfounded.",
      "However, she has responded by saying the footage of the pair filming a slow dance is \"damning\" and corroborates her claims.",
      "The two stars played a couple in the hit film, which came out last year, but have since become embroiled in an increasingly bitter legal battle.",
      "Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 40, in December, accusing him of engaging in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behaviour\" and a smear campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. He countersued last week, claiming she had made a \"duplicitous attempt to destroy\" him.",

      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "On Tuesday, Baldoni's team released almost 10 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage to outlets including the Daily Mail and Variety.",
      "It includes three takes from a scene set in a bar, and starts with a caption saying they \"clearly refute\" Lively's allegations of inappropriate behaviour, and show both actors \"clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism\".",
      "Lively's lawyers said it showed him \"repeatedly leaning in toward Ms Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character\".",
      "Every moment \"was improvised by Mr Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy co-ordinator present\", they said.",
      "\"Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognise Ms Lively's discomfort.",
      "\"They will recognise her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\"",
      "Releasing the video was \"another example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public\", they claimed.",

      "\"Ms Lively wants very different standards to apply to her but fortunately, truth and authenticity apply to everyone and can never be wrong,\" he said.",
      "What did she say about the scene?",
      "Lively's lawsuit cited the scene as an example of how Baldoni \"ignored well-established industry protocols in filming intimate scenes, and exploited the lack of controls on set to behave inappropriately\".",
      "Her legal documents said he wasn't speaking in character and that no sound was recorded.",
      "\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good.'",
      "\"None of this was remotely in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound - Mr Baldoni was caressing Ms Lively with his mouth in a way that had nothing to do with their roles.",
      "\"When Ms Lively later objected to this behaviour, Mr Baldoni's response was, 'I'm not even attracted to you.'\"",
      "What did he say about the scene?",
      "His legal documents said Lively was \"consistently unable to take direction\" and that she \"insisted\" she wanted the characters to constantly talk, which he disagreed about.",
      "When he tried to \"encourage her to take his direction, Baldoni offered up that he and his wife often just look into each other's eyes silently, to which she responded, 'Like sociopaths,' and laughed.\"",
      "Lively \"continued arguing\" and \"continued to break character\", which was \"extremely confusing for Baldoni\".",
      "He said Lively apologised for the smell of her spray tan and body make-up. \"Baldoni responded, 'It smells good,' and continued acting, slow dancing as he believed his character would with his partner, which requires some amount of physical touching.\"",
      "Lively joked about Baldoni's nose, and that he should get plastic surgery, he said.",
      "\"Any suggestion that this scene was filmed in any manner other than pure professionalism by Baldoni is unequivocally countered with actual evidence,\" his documents added.",
      "\"Her allegation of sexual harassment is a documented and knowingly fabricated lie.\"",
      "What does the video show?",
      "Lively and Baldoni, who was also the film's director, are slow dancing in a bar and their audio was recorded. After an initial exchange in which she questions whether they are in the correct position, they dance and smile silently.",
      "He kisses her forehead then goes to kiss her on the lips before she apparently hesitates and they continue dancing. She then seems to turn her head with their faces close together and he kisses her cheek.",
      "She tells him: \"I think we should be talking. I think it's more romantic if we're like... dancing and talking.\" He agrees and says \"the whole montage is us talking\".",
      "She continues: \"Cause it's like the moment they kiss, then you give them the thing that they want to see.\"",
      "He replies: \"That's why almost kissing is also good.\" She responds: \"Yeah. But we're still talking.\"",
      "They continue dancing affectionately, laughing and discussing the scene. He nuzzles her neck. She tells him talking is \"more romantic\". He says he \"just got lost\" and there's \"no issue with talking most of the time\" because viewers will \"never know [what's being said] in slow motion\".",
      "He tells her \"I know you and Ryan [Reynolds, her husband] talk all the time\", but he and his wife Emily like to stare at each other, joking that \"you would find it terrifying\". She laughs and jokes that \"I'd be like, 'Oh no I found a sociopath'\".",
      "He asks the camera operator to film their lips \"super close\", to which she agrees but adds that they should \"start talking\" and \"don't give it [the kiss] to them\". He agrees they should \"keep restraint\".",
      "They keep dancing with their foreheads and noses touching, upon which she starts laughing because she feels \"so nosey\". He jokes that \"my nose is so big\" and she laughs that the film would have to \"shut down\" and \"deal with that\", adding: \"Just kidding.\"",
      "In the next take, he appears to kiss her neck then says \"Am I getting beard on you today?\" She laughs and responds: \"I'm probably getting spray tan on you.\" He nuzzles the other side of her neck and says: \"It smells good\". She adds: \"Well, it's not that, it's my body make-up\". They continue dancing and he shouts cut.",

      "The statement goes on to say that his lawyers had told producers the allegations - which also included evidence tampering - were \"misleading\" and \"discredited\" but that Warner Bros proceeded to release the documentary \"without regard for Mr Brown, prioritising profits over journalistic integrity\".",
      "In a copy of the complaint, seen by BBC Newsbeat, Chris Brown's lawyers cast doubt on the dancer's reliability as a witness and highlight three claims in the documentary which they say are \"false\".",
      "These include a comment that he has a \"predisposition for punching women in the face\", the dancer's allegation he raped her and a claim he manipulated or deleted texts between them before sharing them with police.",
      "Lawyers say the documentary \"states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser\".",
      "The allegations are said to have caused him emotional distress as well as \"significant harm to [his] reputation, career and business opportunities\".",
      "The documentary has, they say, \"irreparably tarnished [his] career and standing in the public eye\".",

      "But the case was reportedly dismissed by a judge.",
      "The 35-year-old has had a history of well-documented legal troubles.",
      "In 2014, he pleaded guilty to punching a man outside a hotel in Washington DC while he was taking a photo with two women.",
      "Two years later, a model claimed he assaulted her at a Las Vegas casino, however police said there was not enough evidence to bring charges.",
      "A court also ordered him to stay away from ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran in 2017 after she claimed he threatened to kill her.",
      "Last year's documentary also examined other allegations against Chris Brown including a rape inquiry in Paris - in which he was released without charge - and assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009, which he pleaded guilty to.",
      "His lawyers say he's \"never been found at fault for any type of sexual crime\".",

      "Domestic bliss isn't a quality that fans might associate with Teddy Swims.",
      "His huge breakthrough single Lose Control, and the hit album I've Tried Everything But Therapy, were rooted in dysfunction, addiction and heartbreak.",
      "They were inspired by a toxic, mutually destructive relationship from which he had escaped. In the past, he has described it as a \"really co-dependent lifestyle\" that went from \"bender to bender\" as both sides \"leveraged each other's shame against one another\".",
      "As he sings on a recent single, \"I saved my life when I showed you the door\".",
      "But that was only one chapter in the story of the 32-year-old Georgia native Jaten Dimsdale.",
      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",

      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",

      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",

      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",

      "Cottrell-Boyce, whose books include Millions and Cosmic, will warn that while children in the UK may fare well in reading league tables, reading for pleasure is in decline, leading to \"less chance of [them] being happy\".",
      "The Reading Rights Summit will also hear from fellow authors Cressida Cowell and Michael Rosen, two of his predecessors as children's laureate.",
      "Cottrell-Boyce will implore politicians \"to make sure that every single child has access to books, reading and the transformative ways in which they improve long-term life chances\".",
      "The author will add that \"our children are near the top of the global leagues when it comes to the mechanical skill of reading but near the bottom when it comes to 'reading for pleasure.'",
      "\"That our children seem to be experiencing some kind of happiness recession at the moment is not surprising, and I believe that the decline in reading has played its part in this.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of his speech, the writer emphasised the benefits of help with reading in early years. \"It's easy to get depressed about the situation, but there's a huge amount of happiness and optimism to be drawn on,\" he said.",

      "Screen time is also an issue. In his speech, he will say he has heard about some children who \"instead of turning the pages, try to swipe them or make the pictures grow bigger with their fingers\" because they hadn't encountered a book before starting school.",
      "He will also say: \"Yes, it's important for educational attainment. Yes, DCMS (Department for Culture, Media and Sport), it's the most crucial - and most democratic - part of our cultural heritage.",
      "\"Shared reading is an effective, economic health intervention, so yes, it's essential, [Health Secretary] Wes Streeting, to mental health, to bonding, to attachment, to creating a situation where parents and carers can give the best, the most joyous start in life to our children.\"",

      "Many children's laureates have campaigned on similar issues, but Cottrell-Boyce told the BBC he was aiming his message more at the government than the public.",

    "summary": "The US Traitors host and Hollywood star took over at Pitlochry Festival Theatre last year.",
    "story": [
      "He's best known for TV shows like the Traitors US, The Good Wife or Schmigadoon.",
      "But it was another show entirely which brought actor Alan Cumming back to his roots in Highland Perthshire, to begin a brand new chapter in his life - running Pitlochry festival theatre.",
      "\"I was filming an episode of Channel 4's All Aboard Scotland's Poshest trains, and we came to the theatre and spoke to Elizabeth Newman about the work they were doing and afterwards, she asked if I'd ever thought about running a theatre,\" he recalls.",
      "In 2024, filming for the Traitors and two film projects meant even more time in Scotland so when Elizabeth Newman resigned in July,  he quietly applied for the job.",
      "More stories from Tayside and Central",
      "Listen to news from Tayside and Central on BBC Sounds",
      "Although Alan grew up a few miles away in Aberfeldy, his work on Broadway and in film and television had long ago taken him to New York, where he lives with his husband Grant Schaffer.",
      "In the last decade, he's been here more and more, thanks to TV work such as hosting the Traitors American version and shows like Burn, Macbeth and The Bacchae with the National Theatre of Scotland.",
      "\"I have been living partly here for years and in recent years trying to split my time more evenly between Scotland and New York\", he says.",
      "\"I was very honest with the recruitment people about what I could offer. I have other things going on, but I can do a lot remotely.",
      "\"What really excited me was the theatre's mantra to \"share Pitlochry with the world and the world with Pitlochry\".",
      "\"I thought I can do that. I'm from here. I can go out into the world and bring the world back here.\"",
      "The news came as a huge surprise and Cumming insisted the announcement should be made ahead of the Emmy awards, for which he and the rest of the team involved with the Traitors won Outstanding Reality Competition Programme.",
      "Wrapped in his trademark tartan plaid, he was able to bring the world's attention to Pitlochry, something he hopes his appointment will continue to do.",
      "\"I know I have experience, I'm quite talented, and I know a lot of people but being well known is also important. This helps raise profile, and it'll help with fundraising.\"",
      "Like the appointment of Nicola Benedetti as director of the Edinburgh International Festival, it also gives the theatre, and the wider theatrical community a stronger voice when it comes to lobbying for support.",
      "Like Benedetti, he plans to appear on his own stage, as well as continuing with his own projects.",
      "His first season won't be announced until later this year, but he's already in discussions, and says he hopes to \"be in, or direct shows in every season\".",
      "The three day Winter Words festival which he has programmed from 21 February gives a sense of what might be to come in 2026.",
      "Liz Lochhead, Douglas Stuart and Andrew O'Hagan are among those taking part, in a line-up which combines known and unknown.",
      "\"It's got some big bold names and newer and more diverse and slightly outside the box things going on as well. It's my ethos for the first season in microcosm.",
      "\"Theatre is entertaining but it's also about being challenging and provoking. We will have musicals, but they might be ones you don't know. We might also have Shakespeare and classics.",
      "\"It's exciting for me as I want to do things I like but also bring new people in. I'm kind of like the Pied Piper of Pitlochry.\"",
      "Having made the leap from Highland Perthshire to Broadway himself, he's confident he can do the same with the shows they create.",
      "\"One of the things I was asked was what I hoped people would think of my tenure here.",
      "\"I hoped they had fun and enjoyed the experience of being there but I also hope they think wasn't it amazing that we saw that show at Pitlochry and then it went to Broadway. And why not?\"",
      "His \"to do\" list since he started the job officially last week includes getting to know the staff and consulting with the community.",
      "He is keen the town and the wider community in Highland Perthshire make better use of the theatre \u2013 and not just for plays.",
      "Cumming uses the example of the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, where he and Forbes Masson regularly performed as drama students.",
      "\"We've lost that sense of theatres being a community centre, where people can talk, and drink and gather.\"",
      "Sitting in the theatre caf\u00e9, looking out on Ben Vrackie, there's no need for the digital presentation he's prepared for curious Americans - but he's ready to spread the word.",
      "\"People are so excited about coming here,\" he enthuses.",
      "\"A huge part of Pitlochry's allure is the setting.",

      "Known for her provocative statements, she followed that with a post saying she wasn't being reactionary or \"edgy\", but that \"I genuinely mean what I say\".",
      "\"Corporations giggle at protesting,\" Cain wrote. \"Why would anyone ever willingly come down off their throne that they've spent years building off the suffering of their fellow man?\"",

    "summary": "A complaint claimed that paintings of two Hindu deities at an art gallery \"hurt religious sentiments\".",
    "story": [
      "A court in the Indian capital, Delhi, has ordered the seizure of two \"offensive\" paintings by MF Husain, one of India's most famous artists.",
      "The court on Monday granted permission for the police to seize the artworks after a complaint was filed alleging that the paintings, displayed at an art gallery and featuring two Hindu deities, \"hurt religious sentiments\".",
      "Husain, who died in 2011 aged 95, often faced backlash for the depictions of nude Hindu gods in his paintings.",
      "The Delhi Art Gallery (DAG) which held the exhibition said in a statement that it is \"not a party to the legal proceedings and is seeking legal advice\".",
      "The paintings were part of an exhibition called Husain: The Timeless Modernist, showcasing more than 100 works at DAG from 26 October to 14 December.",
      "The complainant, Amita Sachdeva, a lawyer, said on X that on 4 December, she photographed the \"offensive paintings\" displayed at the DAG and, after researching previous complaints against the late artist, filed a police complaint five days later.",
      "On 10 December, Ms Sachdeva reported that she visited the gallery with the investigating officer, only to discover that the paintings had been removed. She claimed that the gallery officials asserted they had never exhibited the paintings.",
      "The BBC has contacted DAG for comment.",
      "The paintings that Ms Sachdeva shared online depicted Hindu gods Ganesha and Hanuman alongside nude female figures. She also alleged that the Delhi police had failed to file a report.",
      "She later petitioned the court to preserve the CCTV footage from the gallery during the period when the paintings were reportedly on display, according to media reports.",
      "On Monday, a judge at Delhi's Patiala House Courts said that the police had accessed the footage and submitted their report. According to the inquiry, the exhibition was held in a private space and was intended solely to showcase the artist's original work, the judge added.",
      "The art gallery said in a statement that they are \"reviewing the situation\" and \"trying to follow developments\".",
      "Maqbool Fida Husain was one of India's biggest painters and was called \"Picasso of India\" but his art often stirred controversy in the country. His works have sold for millions of dollars.",
      "His career was marked by controversy when he was accused of obscenity and denounced by hardline Hindus for a painting of a nude goddess.",
      "In 2006, Husain publicly apologised for his painting, Mother India. It showed a nude woman kneeling on the ground creating the shape of the Indian map. He left the country the same year and lived in self-imposed exile in London until his death.",
      "In 2008, India's Supreme Court refused to launch criminal proceedings against  Husain, saying that his paintings were not obscene and nudity was common in Indian iconography and history.",
      "The court had then dismissed an appeal against a high court ruling that quashed criminal proceedings against Husain in the cities of Bhopal, Indore and Rajkot, condemning the rise of a \"new puritanism\" in India.",
      "The court also rejected calls for Husain, then in exile, to be summoned and asked to explain his paintings, which were accused of outraging religious sentiments and disturbing national integrity.",
      "\"There are so many such subjects, photographs and publications. Will you file cases against all of them? What about temple structures? Husain's work is art. If you don't want to see it, don't see it. There are so many such art forms in temple structures,\" the top court said.",
      "Many believe there is a rising tide of illiberalism against artistic expression in India.",
      "In October the Bombay High Court reprimanded the customs department for seizing artworks by renowned artists FN Souza and Akbar Padamsee on the grounds that they were \"obscene material.\"",
      "The court ruled that not every nude or sexually explicit painting qualifies as obscene and ordered the release of seven seized artworks.",

      "The British rock guitarist John Sykes, who played with Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy, has died aged 65.",
      "A statement on his website said Sykes \"passed away after a hard fought battle with cancer\".",
      "It described him as a \"thoughtful, kind, and charismatic man whose presence lit up the room\" and said that, in his final days, he had expressed a \"sincere love and gratitude for his fans\".",
      "Sykes appeared on two Whitesnake albums and co-wrote some of the band's best-known songs, including Still Of The Night and Is This Love.",
      "He began his career in 1980 with heavy metal band Tygers Of Pan Tang, recording two albums before joining Thin Lizzy in 1982.",
      "He played on the 1983 release Thunder and Lightning before accompanying frontman Phil Lynott on a European tour with a separate group called The Three Musketeers.",
      "In 1984, he joined Whitesnake at the invitation of founder and frontman David Coverdale, recording parts for their Slide It In album and later for their self-titled 1987 release which was a critical and commercial success.",

      "The statement on Sykes's website read: \"It is with great sorrow we share that John Sykes has passed away after a hard fought battle with cancer.",
      "\"He will be remembered by many as a man with exceptional musical talent but for those who didn't know him personally, he was a thoughtful, kind, and charismatic man whose presence lit up the room.",

    "story": [
      "Chappell Roan can't be stopped.",
      "Over the last 12 months, the 26-year-old has become the buzziest star in pop. A flamboyant, flame-haired sensation, whose songs are as colourful as they are raw.",
      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",
      "Success has been all the sweeter because her former record label refused to release many of the songs that exploded onto the charts last year.",

      "Reaching pop's A-list isn't just a vindication but a revolution.",
      "The 26-year-old is the first female pop star to achieve mainstream success as an openly queer person, rather than coming out as part of their post-fame narrative.",
      "On a more personal level, she's finally got the financial security to move into a house of her own, and acquire a rescue cat, named Cherub Lou.",
      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

      "For the second time in the seven years since his death, Mac Miller fans have the chance to listen to a new album.",
      "The US rapper was 26 when he died from an accidental overdose in 2018. Friends say he was lost in his prime and fans' hunger for new music has remained.",
      "Balloonerism, released on Friday to generally positive reviews, follows the 2020 posthumous release of Circles, made of unfinished work completed after he died.",
      "Collaborators say the studio tracks first laid down more than 10 years ago used in the new album have barely been changed.",
      "Some of those who worked on the new release - who were present at the recording sessions - describe the finished product as haunting, raw, and unpolished.",
      "Circles was a big success but a mixed reception to recent posthumous albums from other artists has caused critics to question whether less is more when it comes to releasing music after death.",
      "Audio engineer Josh Berg was in the LA studio, known as the Sanctuary, where Mac wrote and recorded all his material between 2013-2014.",
      "\"I always hoped this day would come,\" he says of Ballonerism's final release.",
      "\"And now it's kind of sad.",
      "\"Everything except one thing is amazing about this situation. It really makes me feel his loss.\"",
      "Mac Miller, real name Malcolm James McCormick, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and started making music at school.",
      "His debut album, Blue Slide Park, was the first independently released record to top the Billboard 200 chart in 16 years and all of his later albums followed the same path to the top five in the US.",
      "He wrote Balloonerism between labels in 2014 and producer Eric Dan, who worked with Mac since he was a teenager, tells Newsbeat he was \"just starting to come into his own\".",
      "\"That period was like a creative renaissance for him,\" he says. \"He was a creation machine.\"",
      "Josh says so many projects were started in that time but Balloonerism was among the ones that came closest to release, with Mac even getting to the stage of commissioning artwork.",
      "While Circles was \"in pretty rough shape\" when he died and finished off by producers, Eric says Balloonerism is largely untouched.",
      "\"We made a conscious decision to keep things as they were and not go back and 'fix' mistakes, tune things or add anything.",
      "\"The rough edges were part of its charm and highlighted where Mac was creatively at that time.\"",
      "Josh describes the result of leaving in those imperfections as an album that's \"raw and emotional\", even \"extremely haunting\" in the context of Mac's death.",
      "\"Once you start pulling everything apart and dusting it off, it starts to lose its magic,\" Josh says.",
      "\"It's beautiful to release an album that's not so scoured of imperfection, that's authentic and real.\"",
      "It's that question of authenticity which troubles some fans about music released after an artist has died.",
      "In 2024, posthumous albums released by the families of SOPHIE and Juice WRLD had mixed responses. While SOPHIE's was named Rough Trade's album of the year, some critics considered it too \"safe\" for such a pioneering and experimental talent.",
      "Robin Murray, editor-in-chief at Clash magazine, reviewed Juice WRLD's third posthumous album, The Party Never Ends.",
      "The US rapper died two years after Mac, also from an accidental overdose, leaving a cache of unreleased music but Robin tells Newsbeat the latest album sounded like \"unfinished demos that had been stretched\".",
      "\"Releasing an album or body of work after an artist has passed away is an incredibly difficult and complex task,\" he says.",
      "\"There's no telling how the artist would have proceeded with that work, if they would have proceeded at all.\"",
      "Josh and Eric agree it's fair to question how Mac might have changed Balloonerism but they both believe it was always his plan to be release it when the time was right.",
      "Eric also says that after \"bootleg\" versions of the album were leaked, it was important an official release, in line with Mac's most up-to-date track lists, allowed the family to regain control of the album.",
      "\"I can certainly see where people have concerns with it,\" Josh accepts.",
      "\"I was less concerned but now in this process maybe I shared more of that concern as we got closer.",
      "\"He would always change the playlist, he would always do something I'd never expect, so it will never really be true to him.\"",
      "'Brushing away the myth'",
      "The release of Balloonerism coincides with what would have been Mac's 33rd birthday and a companion film was shared alongside it.",
      "At a sold-out screening in London, fan Conor says it felt like the last opportunity to \"share thanks for the artist that he was\".",
      "Most of the fans who spoke to Newsbeat say they had no reservations about the album being released but Conor says the passage of more than 10 years \"does make it more complex\".",
      "\"It's sad, at some point it does have to end but I'm all here for it for now.\"",
      "Another fan, Carolina, says she \"didn't give it too much thought, because I'm just a sucker\".",
      "\"I just want more, everything he made and was ready to be released, I'd like to be released.\"",
      "Robin says the success of Circles was in part due to how closely Mac's family worked with people who knew him.",

      "Unlike the UK series, the contestants on the US version are celebrities. The series two cast was primarily made up of US reality stars - with the additions of British Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.",
      "Players competing for the cash prize this time include Britney Spears' ex-husband Sam Asghari, former WWE wrestler Nikki Garcia and British aristocrat Lord Ivar Mountbatten.",

      "Jade Thirlwall talks new music... and Harry Styles",
      "Jade Thirlwall waited the longest of any member of Little Mix to release solo music, but she's given fans plenty to get stuck into recently.",
      "In July, she dropped debut single Angel of My Dreams, and she kicked off 2025 with a banger: a dance-pop track called It girl, which appears to take a swipe at the wider music industry.",
      "On Tuesday, she's appearing on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify.",
      "I'm told it's going to be a \"candid\" conversation, in which Jade will discuss her early career and the X Factor era - including a date with Harry Styles.",
      "Other topics on the agenda include fellow bandmate Jesy Nelson's departure from Little Mix, her experience of an eating disorder, her boyfriend (Rizzle Kicks star Jordan Stephens, in case you haven't been following), and her new album.",
      "However good it is, it surely can't top her interview on podcast Sidetracked last year, in which she confessed she had a \"poo incident\" on stage with Little Mix. You can listen back to that on BBC Sounds.",
      "Is The Brutalist too long?",
      "The Brutalist has already won three prizes at the Golden Globes, and picked up nine Bafta film nominations.",
      "The film, which is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars, is released in UK cinemas this Friday.",
      "Starring Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones, it tells the tale of a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two.",
      "It's also really long: 215 minutes including a 15-minute intermission in the middle.",
      "I grew up watching Bollywood films, so a lengthy film doesn't spook me.",
      "But my colleague Lizo Mzimba asked director Brady Corbet for his take on the duration.",
      "\"I think that's something you can't concern yourself with. You have to do what's right for the project,\" he said.",
      "\"The length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting on a big canvas. I love small portraits and I love [German painter] Anselm Kiefer. For me, there's a space for both of them.",
      "\"And at the end of the day, especially if the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Lizo's also interviewed the stars of the show - watch out for that later this week.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:44:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Harry Clark is among the former contestants who reveals some of the show's secrets to the BBC.",
    "story": [
      "The Traitors is one of the few things getting us through a miserable January. For three nights a week, it feels as if the whole country is living and breathing the cloaks-and-daggers drama.",
      "For the other four painstaking days when the show isn't on air, we're sharing our opinions and theories with everyone from colleagues to strangers online.",
      "But it's not just tactics and contestants viewers are talking about - my group chats are incessantly pinging with questions about what happens behind the scenes, where the cast go once they leave the castle, and whether Charlotte will ever reveal her real accent.",
      "Luckily, we no longer need to ponder most of these questions, as former contestants have been speaking to BBC News about the secret workings of the Traitors castle.",
      "What does a typical day in the castle look like, and what happens before breakfast?",
      "The order in which the contestants arrive at breakfast is a source of tension and speculation on the show.",
      "Series one faithful Maddy Smedley explains that contestants are kept in separate holding rooms when they come to the castle in the morning and are called to go into breakfast individually or as a group.",
      "Similarly, in the evenings, contestants wait in a holding room until a runner comes to individually escort them out of the building and into a car.",
      "Traitor and series two champion Harry Clark says there are no clocks in the castle and contestants have no sense of time.",
      "\"You get picked up in the morning and when filming is over, you get dropped back to the lodgings,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't know what time the mission starts or when lunch is - we rely on the production team to direct us and in between, we all just sit around and chat.\"",
      "Unlike the hour-long episodes we see, Harry says the days aren't filled with wall-to-wall traitor speculation.",
      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:08:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Apple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.",
    "story": [
      "Spoiler warning for season two's opening episode",
      "\"I don't think Mark, in the wildest reaches of his imagination, thought his company could do something as nefarious as faking a death,\" says actor Adam Scott of his character in Apple TV's Severance.",
      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

      "\"Mental health is still very, very much the kind of pariah in terms of being underfunded and being under thought about, and really in terms of being dehumanised in a way that we don't find elsewhere,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",
      "Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea \u2013 when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  \u2013 is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways.",
      "But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body.",
      "Dr Aly said: \"Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills.\"",
      "Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.",
      "Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells.",
      "This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating.",
      "However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system.",
      "\"It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,\" Dr Aly said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts.",
      "'Ozempic babies'",
      "The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said.",
      "\"When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,\" he said.",
      "But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, \"maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit\".",
      "However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings.",
      "Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected \"Ozempic babies\".",
      "And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings.",
      "Protective effect",
      "Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing.",
      "Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect.",

      "And further studies in other patients were \"awaited with interest\".",
      "The \"most surprising finding\" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints.",

    "title": "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",

      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",
      "\"Vaccine confidence across Europe is now really struggling and we can't just assume it's going to bounce back without a concerted effort.\"",

      "Deprived children in England will \"pay the price\" of the government's changes to schools, Kemi Badenoch has said as she accused ministers of \"an act of vandalism\".",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative leader argued that the government's Schools Bill would cut pay for teachers in academies, close down routes into teaching and block failing schools from automatically becoming academies.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said academies had been introduced by the previous Labour government and were \"here to stay\".",
      "He said it was a \"disgrace\" that Tory MPs opposed the bill, which also aims to protect vulnerable children, set up breakfast clubs and limit uniform costs.",

      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",

      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",
      "He said the opposition leader should \"change her mind\" and back the measures.",

      "Academy schools were first introduced under Sir Tony Blair and enthusiastically expanded by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2010.",
      "So far only one Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh - has publicly criticised the bill, however it is privately causing significant anxiety among Labour MPs, generally on the right of the party, who are proud of academies.",

      "The total \u00a317.8bn borrowed by the government last month was much higher than the \u00a314.6bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's official forecaster.",
      "Interest charged on government debt hit \u00a38.3bn, marking the third-highest December debt interest repayments since monthly records began in 1997.",

      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",

      "However, the Crime Reporters Association, representing around 50 senior crime and home affairs correspondents, has written to the CPS raising concerns that the service is breaching a long-established principle that there is no legal risk in publishing material about a case after guilty pleas and before sentencing.",

      "Published21 January 2025",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy says some opposition members of the House of Lords are \"intent on wrecking\" the Football Governance Bill by having it delayed \"for years to come\".",
      "The legislation, which will establish the first independent regulator for the professional men's game in England, was reintroduced to Parliament by the government in October.",
      "It has just completed the first 'committee stage' in the Lords, where hundreds of potential amendments have been tabled.",
      "One that could soon be voted on is a proposal to reclassify the legislation as a 'hybrid bill', which would require additional consultation with clubs.",
      "\"We really are at a critical juncture here,\" said Nandy, speaking at an event organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Football and the English Football League (EFL).",
      "\"We've had what is known as a 'wrecking amendment' put in front of the House of Lords in recent weeks to turn this bill into a hybrid bill, which would bury it in committee for years and years to come.",
      "\"And I do want to say to that handful of peers that have decided to take that approach, 'what you are doing is killing off the hopes and dreams and inheritance of fans who deserve far, far better'.\"",
      "A hybrid bill is one that is deemed to target specific private interests - such as football clubs. It must allow those affected to submit a petition to Parliament outlining their opposition, potentially adding to the time needed for it to pass into legislation. The hybrid amendment has been put forward by Tory frontbench peer Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay.",
      "Conservative peers have denied claims they are trying to delay the bill, insisting they are subjecting it to proper scrutiny.",

      "Background to Football Governance Bill",
      "The landmark legislation was tabled initially in March by the previous Conservative government, but failed to pass through Parliament before the general election was called in May.",
      "The reintroduced version will give the regulator powers to assess the impact of the Premier League's controversial 'parachute payments' to relegated clubs as part of a 'State of the Game' review every five years.",
      "Its findings could influence which proposed sharing model the regulator may then impose - the Premier League's or the EFL's - if it is asked to decide how much money the top flight should redistribute to the football pyramid via 'backstop powers'.",
      "It will also \"explicitly require clubs to provide effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "However, while supporter groups and the EFL are among those to have welcomed the bill, the Premier League is concerned at the regulator having \"unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues\", and also said it could have \"a negative impact\" on competitiveness and investment.",
      "The legislation has also faced opposition from peers such as West Ham United vice chair Baroness Brady, who told the Lords that there are \"dangers lurking in this bill\".",
      "Other members of the Lords have expressed concerns over the potential cost to smaller clubs, although the government said there was no intention to \"impose unnecessary, onerous and burdensome requirements\" on clubs, which was \"in no-one's interest\".",
      "'Hard but important message'",
      "Last month Nandy told MPs it was \"high time we got on with it\" when asked about the scrutiny the legislation had faced in the House of Lords. She has now delivered what she called \"a hard but important message\".",
      "\"It was a Labour opposition and the Conservative government that put the commitment to continue with these reforms into our manifestos, and it was the British people who voted for them,\" she said.",
      "\"And my message to those handful of Conservative peers is: 'We will not rest until we make good on that promise to fans'.",
      "\"This is what people voted for - this is nothing less than fans deserve, and we are a government that will leave no stone unturned to deliver on that promise. Change for fans has been long overdue, that change is coming, and nobody will stand in its way.\"",
      "The bill will now pass to the 'report stage' of its journey through the House of Lords, where some of the proposed amendments will be voted on, before it passes to the Commons. The government hopes it will come into law later this year.",

    "summary": "Darren Jones, the chancellor's second-in-command, is confident UK-US trading relationships could be deepened.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump will want to do a good deal with the UK, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones has insisted.",
      "Jones, the chancellor's second-in-command, said he was confident UK-US trading relationships could be deepened and that Peter Mandelson will be \"brilliant\" as the new UK ambassador to the US.",
      "However, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has claimed Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer is in a \"weak\" negotiating position due to his wish to strengthen ties with the EU at the same time as with the US.",
      "The PM has insisted he can walk a tightrope and balance strong trading and security relationships on both sides, despite Trump's dislike of the EU.",
      "But some nervousness seems apparent, with Lord Mandelson, launching a charm offensive ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, lauding his \"straight talking and deal-making instincts\" and talking up a new \"Atlantic alliance\".",
      "Mandelson praises Trump ahead of inauguration",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "IMF warns on Trump's plans but upgrades UK outlook",
      "Jones said the government was optimistic about the chances of a good relationship with the incoming administration, highlighting \"opportunities for us to seize\" around a potential post-Brexit trade deal, which he suggested could include technology.",
      "\"Donald Trump is well-known for wanting to do a good deal - I think there are plenty of good deals for us to do together,\" he said.",
      "\"There are definitely opportunities to deepen our trading relationships, not least in technology, science and research... and I think that's something that could be a positive outcome.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the Treasury minister suggested the UK could dodge Trump's pledge for a 20% tax on all imports into the US due to not being in a \"trade deficit\", adding ministers have \"prepared for all scenarios\".",
      "Jones also expressed confidence Lord Mandelson will \"form a very strong partnership with the new administration\", despite some reports that the incoming president may reject him - and a top Trump adviser dismissing him as an \"absolute moron\".",
      "The appointment of Lord Mandelson, who is best-known as a New Labour spin doctor and minister under Tony Blair, is the first time in 50 years that a PM has selected a politician rather than a diplomat for the role, which Jones said was \"because we want to do things differently\".",
      "Asked about the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning of \"resurgent fascism\" ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jones strongly disagreed, insisting the UK government respected Trump's democratic mandate, adding: \"I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it\".",
      "A much less rosy view of the \"special relationship\" was painted by Farage, a long-time supporter of Trump, whose offer of acting as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect has so far been rejected by the government.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, the Reform UK leader said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration, and that all evidence - including Lord Mandelson's appointment - suggests they are not doing that.",
      "\"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people,\" he said.",
      "Farage said he feared the UK would squander \"an amazing opportunity\" to get away from tariffs and negotiate free trade deals due to the prime minister's refusal to choose the US over the EU.",
      "\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before,\" he said. \"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do.",
      "\"If we have a deteriorating relationship with America that does hurt us financially, it'll be the Labour government's fault,\" adding that Trump is \"probably more Eurosceptic\" than he is.",
      "'Blind faith'",
      "The fact the UK still does not have a free trade deal with the US, despite this being a priority in Boris Johnson's Conservative manifesto in 2019, has been criticised by the party's current leader Kemi Badenoch, who said leaving the EU without a growth plan was  \"a mistake\".",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, a prominent voice in the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, was questioned about Badenoch's comments by Kuenssberg after she urged swift action to agree a UK-US trade deal.",
      "Patel, who was Johnson's home secretary, said there had been plans to legislate around starting the Brexit process - but she acknowledged a lack of plans for what to do afterwards to rebuild economic relationships.",
      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

      "One insider tells me there hasn't been too much preparation for multiple specific scenarios because \"you'd drive yourself crazy\" trying to guess Trump's next steps. But another source says various papers have been prepared to be presented to the wider Cabinet.",
      "I'm told the focus has been \"looking for opportunities\" rather than panicking about whether Trump might follow through on some of his more outlandish statements, such as annexing Canada.",
      "The PM's picked one of Labour's wiliest operators as his voice in DC, Lord Mandelson, who on Friday chose to write a piece for Fox News, Trump's favourite news outlet.

      "There is no question the intelligence and security relationship is incredibly close and was maintained during Trump's first term \u2013 despite some pretty big surprises at the UK end.",
      "One source remembers that \"the biggest jaw dropper was after the Salisbury attacks\", when two Russian agents used the nerve agent Novichok on the streets of the UK. President Trump was at Chequers with then-PM Theresa May and her team, and seemed reluctant to take the attack as seriously as the UK was demanding.",
      "One of those present explains: \"We were arguing about how bad and destabilising that was \u2013 he asked why. We said a state with nuclear weapons had used this on the soil of another state with nukes, and he said, 'I didn't know the UK had nuclear weapons'.\"",
      "But during that first term, despite Trump's seeming threats to NATO, his bellicose rhetoric did push more European states to cough up extra cash for defence. The Abraham Accords were signed, though those agreements did not, as Trump boasted at the time, achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. But they did mark progress.",

That could leave Nato, the western defence alliance, split and fundamentally weakened. Sources question, however, whether this would really serve Trump's interests. After all he needs allies and a united West to combat China, America's biggest rival.",

      "Sources point to a weaker Iran, progress towards the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel, and a growing sense that both sides want to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end. Trump's bravado about ending the war in a day has already softened to a three-to-six-month ambition and \"there's no sign of a rush to abandonment now\", says one insider.",

      "\"The paradox is that weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace in Ukraine,\" he added.",

A City source says: \"You're always heart in mouth, waiting for the next wacky idea, or for him to say something crazy that is going to impact your business, a $10bn deal that's on the slate, and you are three quarters of the way there \u2013 suddenly he'll say something that can make it fall to bits overnight.\"",
      "And it's not just his late-night online posts causing worry. One of his sells to the American public was to help those trading at home by putting taxes on imports, or tariffs, making it much more expensive for other countries to sell into the States.",
      "But as the IMF warned yesterday, slapping extra tariffs on other countries could hit them hard, and impact the rest of the world's earning power.",
      "In Cabinet there's awareness of how big a departure it would be if Trump goes as far as he has suggested. One minister told me: \"It's a huge moment of history \u2013 American pledging a different way of doing business to what's essentially been in place since the second world war.\"",
      "China and the EU, the other two big trading blocs, would be likely to answer back which could lead to \"huge ramifications of a global trade war\", the minister acknowledges.",
      "Another senior figure warns the UK might struggle to be relevant in a bust up on that scale, saying there'll be an \"arm wrestle between the three \u2013 they won't pay the UK or our interests very much attention\".",
      "As Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, looks to roll back regulation and cut tax, a City insider suggests the UK could fall out of favour because Trump's ambition is to build a very different economy to ours, and that could create a tension of its own.",
      "But another City insider points out that the stock market is \"one of the metrics he cares most about\", and that it is driven by the big tech companies, many of whom depend on selling into China. \"The love affair with the tech bros mean he's not going to want to undermine too much of that,\" they said.",
      "Leader to leader",
      "Whether it's on the economy or Ukraine or any other issue, the relationship between president and prime minister will be absolutely crucial.",
      "Starmer and Trump could hardly be more different. A lawyerly leader known as \"Mr Rules\" versus a man who is a convicted felon and has made a career out of behaving as if rules don't apply to him.",
      "A No 10 source says forget all the noise, and points to the two men meeting in autumn and holding three phone calls since. \"It is the direct conversations that really matter \u2013 whatever Trump's personal style it's clear the substance is there,\" they say, adding that the PM's calm temperament helps.",
      "But others who've dealt with Trump in government, and been on calls with Trump and previous prime ministers, warn how difficult it can be. \"On a good day, fantastic, on a bad day, you'd be crouching,\" one source said.",
      "Another former official who was part of meetings with Trump and Boris Johnson said \"they were like two silverbacks wrestling\", making staff listening in next door cry with laughter. Johnson would \"flatter him obsequiously\" to get what he wanted.",
      "The official was also on calls between Trump and May. These were totally different, with \"more than a whiff of misogyny, he would shout over her\" and talk about the Queen or invite her to play golf, rather than discuss tricky subjects May wanted to raise.",
      "They believe handling Trump will be Sir Keir's biggest challenge: \"We sent him a vicar's daughter, then a pirate who knew how to handle him, now a human rights lawyer,\" they say, adding \"it's not going to work in a world increasingly like the time of 1930s strong men\".",
      "Whatever happens behind closed doors, as America's closest ally, defending Trump's decisions could be incredibly uncomfortable for the prime minister.",
      "A former No 10 official says: \"If Trump says there'll have to be partition in Ukraine, Boris will say awful, others in Labour will say awful, but if Starmer won't sell it in Europe, Trump will take offence and he will punish him.\"",
      "Starmer's allies are more sanguine that \"the politics don't have to match for the relationship to be a success\".",
      "And a success is what they must hope for. It is no secret Labour would have preferred the Democrats and some staff even went to bang on doors for Kamala Harris.",
      "The question for government is how to influence Trump to get what the UK wants, and how to keep its head when the inevitable dramas arrive.",
      "A foreign policy insider told me: \"It might come at a price, but it is in our interest for him to be a success, not be cantankerous.\"",
      "The incoming president is perhaps both an emblem and a product of the changed and uncertain times we live in. As one minister says, \"it's all gone in Trump's direction\".",

      "The government resisted the calls, but on Thursday announced a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries.",

      "So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.",
      "In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed \u00a3125.1bn.",
      "The most recent monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the government borrowed \u00a317.8bn in December 2024 - \u00a310.1bn more than in December 2023, and the highest level for the month for four years.",
      "Borrowing between March and December 2024 stands at \u00a3129.9bn, which is\u00a0\u00a38.9bn\u00a0more than for the same period a year earlier.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:05:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",

      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

      "The mission, called SpaDeX, blasted off from Sriharikota launch pad in southern India on 30 December. The two spacecraft, launched on a single rocket, separated in space. The docking process, initially scheduled for 7 January, was rescheduled a number of times.",
      "On Thursday, the space agency announced it had created history by becoming only the fourth country to have docked spacecraft in orbit.",

      "The second time, it said there had been a glitch while trying to bring the satellites closer, but added that the spacecraft were safe.",
      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",
      "S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as \"a very complex process\" that needed extreme precision and coordination.",
      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",

      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Technically, even after the 75 days have passed, it would be possible for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:12:58 GMT",
    "summary": "War appears to have accelerated the spread of pathogens resistant to antibiotics in the country.",
    "story": [
      "When Pte Oleksander Bezverkhny was evacuated to the Feofaniya Hospital in Kyiv, few believed he would live. The 27-year-old had a severe abdominal injury and shrapnel had ripped through his buttocks. Both his legs were amputated.",
      "Then, doctors discovered that his infections were resistant to commonly-used antibiotics \u2013 and the already daunting task of saving his life became almost hopeless.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is when bacteria evolve and learn how to defend themselves against antibiotics and other medicines, rendering them ineffective.",
      "Ukraine is far from the only country affected by this issue: around 1.4 million people globally died of a AMR infection in 2021, and in the UK there were 66,730 serious antibiotic-resistant infections in 2023. However, war appears to have accelerated the spread of multi-resistant pathogens in Ukraine.",
      "Clinics treating war injuries have registered a sharp increase of AMR cases. More than 80% of all patients admitted to Feofaniya Hospital have infections caused by microbes which are resistant to antibiotics, according to deputy chief physician Dr Andriy Strokan.",
      "Ironically, antimicrobial-resistant infections often originate from medical facilities.",
      "Medical staff try to follow strict hygiene protocols and use protective equipment to minimise the spread of these infections but facilities can be overwhelmed with people injured in the war.",
      "Dr Volodymyr Dubyna, the head of the Mechnikov Hospital's ICU, said that since the start of the Russian invasion his unit alone has increased the number of beds from 16 to 50. Meanwhile, with many employees fleeing the war or joining the military themselves, staffing levels are down.",
      "Dr Strokan explained that these circumstances can affect the spread of AMR bacteria. \"In surgical departments there is one nurse that looks after 15-20 patients,\" he said. \"She physically cannot scrub up her hands in the required amount and frequency in order not to spread infections.\"",
      "The nature of this war also means patients are exposed to far more strains of infection than they would be in peacetime. When a soldier is evacuated for medical reasons, they will often pass through multiple facilities, each with their own strains of AMR. While medical professionals say this is unavoidable because of the scale of the war, it only worsens the spread of AMR infections.",
      "This was the case for Pte Bezverkhny who was treated at three different facilities before reaching the hospital in Kyiv. Since his infections could not be treated with the usual medication, his condition deteriorated and he contracted sepsis five times.",
      "This situation is different to other recent conflicts, for example the Afghanistan War, where Western soldiers would be stabilised on site and then air-transferred to a European clinic rather than passing through multiple different local facilities.",
      "This would not be possible in Ukraine as the influx of patients has not been seen since the Second World War, according to Dr Dubyna, whose hospital in Dnipro neighbours front-line regions. Once his patients are stable enough, they are transferred to another clinic \u2013 if it has room \u2013 to free up capacity.",
      "\"In terms of microbiological control, it means they spread [bacteria] further. But if it's not done, we're not able to work. Then it's a catastrophe.\"",
      "With so many wounded, Ukrainian hospitals simply cannot usually afford to isolate infected patients \u2013 meaning that multi-resistant and dangerous bacteria spread unchecked.",
      "The problem is that infections they cause must be treated with special antibiotics from the \"reserve\" list. But the more often doctors prescribe these, the quicker bacteria adapt, making those antibiotics ineffective too.",
      "\"We have to balance our scales,\" Dr Strokan explains. \"On the one hand, we must save a patient. On the other \u2013 we mustn't breed new microorganisms that will have antimicrobial resistance.\"",
      "In Pte Bezverkhny's case, doctors had to use very expensive antibiotics, which volunteers sourced from abroad. After a year in hospital and over 100 operations, his condition is no longer life-threatening.",
      "Doctors managed to save his life. But as pathogens grow more resistant, the struggle to save others only gets harder.",

      "On Wednesday, Jenin's governor said Israeli forces had \"bulldozed all the roads leading to Jenin camp, and leading to Jenin Government hospital\".",

      "The Israeli military said it was investigating the incidents, during which it said Israeli civilians \"instigated riots, set property on fire, and caused damage\". It also said they hurled stones and attacked Israeli security forces.",
      "It happened just as new US President Donald Trump announced he was lifting sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of carrying out attacks in the West Bank.",

    "summary": "A complaint claimed that paintings of two Hindu deities at an art gallery \"hurt religious sentiments\".",
    "story": [
      "A court in the Indian capital, Delhi, has ordered the seizure of two \"offensive\" paintings by MF Husain, one of India's most famous artists.",
      "The court on Monday granted permission for the police to seize the artworks after a complaint was filed alleging that the paintings, displayed at an art gallery and featuring two Hindu deities, \"hurt religious sentiments\".",
      "Husain, who died in 2011 aged 95, often faced backlash for the depictions of nude Hindu gods in his paintings.",
      "The Delhi Art Gallery (DAG) which held the exhibition said in a statement that it is \"not a party to the legal proceedings and is seeking legal advice\".",
      "The paintings were part of an exhibition called Husain: The Timeless Modernist, showcasing more than 100 works at DAG from 26 October to 14 December.",
      "The complainant, Amita Sachdeva, a lawyer, said on X that on 4 December, she photographed the \"offensive paintings\" displayed at the DAG and, after researching previous complaints against the late artist, filed a police complaint five days later.",
      "On 10 December, Ms Sachdeva reported that she visited the gallery with the investigating officer, only to discover that the paintings had been removed. She claimed that the gallery officials asserted they had never exhibited the paintings.",
      "The BBC has contacted DAG for comment.",
      "The paintings that Ms Sachdeva shared online depicted Hindu gods Ganesha and Hanuman alongside nude female figures. She also alleged that the Delhi police had failed to file a report.",
      "She later petitioned the court to preserve the CCTV footage from the gallery during the period when the paintings were reportedly on display, according to media reports.",
      "On Monday, a judge at Delhi's Patiala House Courts said that the police had accessed the footage and submitted their report. According to the inquiry, the exhibition was held in a private space and was intended solely to showcase the artist's original work, the judge added.",
      "The art gallery said in a statement that they are \"reviewing the situation\" and \"trying to follow developments\".",
      "Maqbool Fida Husain was one of India's biggest painters and was called \"Picasso of India\" but his art often stirred controversy in the country. His works have sold for millions of dollars.",
      "His career was marked by controversy when he was accused of obscenity and denounced by hardline Hindus for a painting of a nude goddess.",
      "In 2006, Husain publicly apologised for his painting, Mother India. It showed a nude woman kneeling on the ground creating the shape of the Indian map. He left the country the same year and lived in self-imposed exile in London until his death.",
      "In 2008, India's Supreme Court refused to launch criminal proceedings against  Husain, saying that his paintings were not obscene and nudity was common in Indian iconography and history.",
      "The court had then dismissed an appeal against a high court ruling that quashed criminal proceedings against Husain in the cities of Bhopal, Indore and Rajkot, condemning the rise of a \"new puritanism\" in India.",
      "The court also rejected calls for Husain, then in exile, to be summoned and asked to explain his paintings, which were accused of outraging religious sentiments and disturbing national integrity.",
      "\"There are so many such subjects, photographs and publications. Will you file cases against all of them? What about temple structures? Husain's work is art. If you don't want to see it, don't see it. There are so many such art forms in temple structures,\" the top court said.",
      "Many believe there is a rising tide of illiberalism against artistic expression in India.",
      "In October the Bombay High Court reprimanded the customs department for seizing artworks by renowned artists FN Souza and Akbar Padamsee on the grounds that they were \"obscene material.\"",
      "The court ruled that not every nude or sexually explicit painting qualifies as obscene and ordered the release of seven seized artworks.",

      "Affectionately dubbed Putricia, it will release a smell described as \"wet socks, hot cat food, or rotting possum flesh\".",
      "The long wait and uncertainty as to when Putricia will bloom - has spawned jokes and even a unique lingo in the livestream's chat, with thousands commenting \"WWTF\", or \"We Watch the Flower\".",

      "But once she blooms, viewers can expect to see Putricia unfold a vibrant maroon or crimson skirt, known as a spathe, around her spadix which is the large spike in the middle of the plant.",
      "The Gardens have said it is \"hard to predict exactly when\" Putricia will bloom, but that has not stopped the thousands gathered online.",

      "Race engineer is a key role as the person who works most closely with drivers on the performance, set-up and running of their car. It is their voice that is heard talking to drivers on television broadcasts.",
      "Muller's opposite number on the car of Ocon's team-mate, British rookie Oliver Bearman, will be Ronan O'Hare, another internal recruit who was previously a performance engineer.",
      "Team principal Ayao Komatsu said diversity was increasing in F1, but added: \"It's not like I chose Laura because she's female. We just don't care - nationality, gender, doesn't matter.",
      "\"What matters is work, how you fit into the team, how you can maximise the performance - and Ronan and Laura I believe happen to be the best choice.\"",
      "Komatsu, who became team principal before the 2024 season, said he had wanted to change the race operations team since the early part of last year after spotting weaknesses.",
      "Haas' changes include appointing a new chief race engineer and sporting director, both common positions the low-budget team did not have filled last season.",
      "The new chief race engineer is Francesco Nenci, who most recently worked at Audi's Dakar Rally programme, and has F1 experience with Sauber and Toyota. Mark Lowe, previously Haas' operations team manager, will be sporting director.",
      "\"I felt the trackside team was one of the weakest areas last year, and the more the car became competitive that exposed it more,\" Komatsu said.",
      "\"Towards the end of the year we had the fifth-fastest car. But in terms of execution, we should have finished P6 [in the constructors' championship] but we didn't.",
      "\"Part of it was we left too many points on the table from the trackside operation. So really needed a step-up.\"",
      "Cridelich, from France, follows other female strategy leaders, including Hannah Schmitz, the principal strategy engineer at Red Bull. Ruth Buscombe and Bernie Collins, who previously worked at Sauber and Aston Martin, have both since moved on to broadcasting careers.",
      "Haas have a unique structure in that their in-house operations are pared back as much as possible through their partnership with Ferrari.",

      "Their headquarters are in Kannapolis, North Carolina, but the race team runs out of a modest factory in Banbury, Oxfordshire.",
      "Komatsu said this would be the first year that Haas would have sufficient budget to reach F1's budget cap. A further change in approach is that they would not be using Ferrari's latest redesigned front suspension, preferring to stick with last year's design for consistency of aerodynamic research.",
      "Haas finished seventh overall last year, ahead of Racing Bulls, Williams and Sauber, and Komatsu said his sights were \"set on consistency\".",

      "\"Who [else] only has 300 people or operates out of this kind of building?\" Komatsu said.",

      "The executive order also said the withdrawal was the result of \"unfairly onerous payments\" the US made to the WHO, which is part of the United Nations.",
      "When Trump was still in office the first time around, he was critical of the organisation for being too \"China-centric\" in its tackling of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Trump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued guidance during the outbreak.",

      "Niluper says she has been living in agony.",
      "A Uyghur refugee, she has spent the past decade hoping her husband would join her and their three sons in Turkey, where they now live.",
      "The family was detained in Thailand in 2014 after fleeing increasing repression in their hometown in China's Xinjiang province. She and the children were allowed to leave Thailand a year later. But her husband remained in detention, along with 47 other Uyghur men.",
      "Niluper \u2013 not her real name \u2013 now fears she and her children may never see him again.",
      "Ten days ago, she learned that Thai officials had tried to persuade the detainees to sign forms consenting to be sent back to China. When they realised what was in the forms, they refused to sign them.",
      "The Thai government has denied having any immediate plans to send them back. But human rights groups believe they could be deported at any time.",
      "\"I don't know how to explain this to my sons,\" Niluper told the BBC on a video call from Turkey. Her sons, she says, keep asking about their father. The youngest has never met him.",
      "\"I don't know how to digest this. I'm living in constant pain, constant fear that at any moment I may get the news from Thailand that my husband has been deported.\"",
      "Who are the Uyghurs?",
      "China pressures Uyghur families to quash dissent abroad",
      "'Hell on earth'",
      "The last time Thailand deported Uyghur asylum seekers was in July 2015. Without warning, it put 109 of them onto a plane back to China, prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.",
      "The few photos that were released show them hooded and handcuffed, guarded by large numbers of Chinese police officers. Little is known about what happened to them after their return. Other deported Uyghurs have received long prison sentences in secret trials.",
      "The nominee for Secretary of State in the incoming Trump administration, Marco Rubio, has promised to press Thailand not to send the remaining Uyghurs back.",
      "Their living conditions have been described by one human rights defender as \"a hell on earth\".",
      "They are all being held in the Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) in central Bangkok, which houses most of those charged with immigration violations in Thailand. Some are there only briefly, while waiting to be deported; others are there much longer.",
      "Driving along the narrow, congested road known as Suan Phlu it is easy to miss the non-descript cluster of cement buildings, and difficult to believe they house an estimated 900 detainees \u2013 the Thai authorities give out no precise numbers.",
      "The IDC is known to be hot, overcrowded and unsanitary. Journalists are not allowed inside. Lawyers usually warn their clients to avoid being sent there if at all possible.",
      "There are 43 Uyghurs there, plus another five being held in a Bangkok prison for trying to escape. They are the last of around 350 who fled China in 2013 and 2014.",
      "They are kept in isolation from other inmates and are rarely allowed visits by outsiders or lawyers. They get few opportunities to exercise, or even to see daylight. They have been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa. Five Uyghurs have died in custody.",
      "\"The conditions there are appalling,\" says Chalida Tajaroensuk, director of the People's Empowerment Foundation, an NGO trying to help the Uyghurs.",
      "\"There is not enough food \u2013 it is mostly just soup made with cucumber and chicken bones. It is crammed in there. The water they get, both for drinking and washing, is dirty. Only basic medicines are provided and these are inadequate. If someone falls ill, it takes a long time to get an appointment with the doctor. And because of the dirty water, the hot weather and bad ventilation, a lot of the Uyghurs get rashes or other skin problems.\"",
      "But the worst part of their detention, say those who have experienced it, is not knowing how long they will be imprisoned in Thailand, and the constant fear of being sent back to China.",
      "Niluper says there were always rumours about deportation but it was difficult to find out more. Escaping was hard because they had children with them.",
      "\"It was horrible. We were so scared all the time,\" recalls Niluper.",
      "\"When we thought about being sent back to China, we would have preferred to die in Thailand.\"",
      "China accused of closing and destroying mosques",
      "China 'sending Uighur children to orphanages'",
      "China's repression of the Muslim Uyghurs has been well documented by the UN and human rights groups. Up to one million Uyghurs are believed to have been detained in re-education camps, in what human rights advocates say is a state campaign to eradicate Uyghur identity and culture. There are many allegations of torture and enforced disappearances, which China denies. It says it has been running \"vocational centres\" focused on de-radicalising Uyghurs.",
      "Niluper says she and her husband faced hostility from Chinese state officials over their religiosity - her husband was an avid reader of religious texts.",
      "The couple made the decision to flee when people they knew were being arrested or disappearing. The family were in a group of 220 Uyghurs who were caught by the Thai police trying to cross the border to Malaysia in March 2014.",
      "Niluper was held in an IDC near the border, and then later in Bangkok, until with 170 other women and children, she was allowed in June 2015 to go to Turkey, which usually offers Uyghurs asylum.",
      "But her husband remains in the Bangkok IDC. They were separated when they were detained, and she has had no contact with him since a brief meeting they were permitted in July 2014.",
      "She says she was one of 18 pregnant women and 25 children crammed into a room that was just four by eight metres. The food was \"bad and there was never enough for all of us\".",
      "\"I was the last one to give birth, at midnight, in the bathroom. The next day the guard saw my condition and that of my baby was not good, so they took us to the hospital.\"",
      "Niluper was also separated from her eldest son, who was just two years old at the time and held with his father \u2013 an experience which she says has traumatised him, after experiencing \"terrible conditions\" and witnessing a guard beating an inmate. When the guards brought him back to her, she says, he did not recognise her.",
      "\"He was so scared, screaming and crying. He could not understand what had happened. He did not want to talk to anyone.\"",
      "It took a long time before he accepted his mother, she says, and after that he would not leave her even for a moment, even after they had arrived in Turkey.",
      "\"It took a really, really long time for him to understand that he was finally in a safe place.\"",
      "Pressure from Beijing",
      "Thailand has never explained why it will not allow the remaining Uyghurs to join their families in Turkey, but it is almost certainly because of pressure from China.",
      "Unlike other inmates in the IDC, the fate of the Uyghurs is not handled by the Immigration Department but instead by Thailand's National Security Council, a body chaired by the prime minister in which the military has significant influence.",
      "As the influence of the US, Thailand's oldest military ally, wanes, that of China has been steadily increasing. The current Thai government is keen to build even closer ties to China, to help revive the faltering economy.",
      "The United Nations Refugee Agency has been accused of doing little to help the Uyghurs, but says it is given no access to them, so is unable to do much. Thailand does not recognise refugee status.",
      "Accommodating China's wish to get the Uyghurs back is not without risk though. Thailand has just taken a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, for which it lobbied hard.",
      "Deporting 48 men who have already endured more than a decade of incarceration would badly tarnish the image the Thai government is trying to project.",
      "Thailand will also be mindful of what happened just a month after the last mass deportation in 2015.",
      "On 17 August that year a powerful bomb exploded at a shrine in Bangkok which was popular with Chinese tourists. Twenty people were killed, in what was widely assumed to be a retaliation by Uyghur militants, although the Thai authorities tried to downplay the link.",
      "Two Uyghur men were charged with the bombing, but their trial has lasted for nine years, with no end in sight. One of them, say his lawyers, is almost certainly innocent. A veil of secrecy surrounds the trial; the authorities seem reluctant to let anything from the hearings tying the bomb to the deportation to get out.",
      "Even those Uyghurs who have managed to get to Turkey must then deal with their uncertain status there, and with the severance of all communications with their families in Xinjiang.",
      "\"I have not heard my mother's voice for 10 years,\" says Hasan Imam, an Uyghur refugee who now works as a lorry driver in Turkey.",
      "He was in the same group as Niluper caught by the Malaysian border in 2014.",
      "He remembers how the following year the Thai authorities deceived them about their plan to deport some of them to China. He says they were told some men would be moved to a different facility, because the one they were in was too crowded.",
      "This was after some women and children had been sent to Turkey, and, unusually, the men in the camp were also allowed to talk to their wives and children in Turkey on a phone.",
      "\"We were all happy, and full of hope,\" Hassan says. \"They selected them, one by one. At this point they had no idea they would be sent back to China. It was only later, through an illicit phone we had, that we found out from Turkey that they had been deported.\"",
      "This filled the remaining detainees with despair, recalls Hasan, and two years later, when he was moved temporarily to another holding camp, he and 19 others made a remarkable escape, using a nail to make a hole in a crumbling wall.",
      "Eleven were recaptured, but Hasan managed to cross the forested border into Malaysia, and from there reached Turkey.",
      "\"I do not know what condition my parents are in but for those still detained in Thailand it is even worse,\" he says.",
      "They fear being sent back and imprisoned in China \u2013 and they also fear that it would mean more severe punishment for their families, he explains.",

      "The death toll is also extremely high, which raises further questions.",
      "\"There will always be fires, but we would not expect so many people to die in this type of building,\" said Prof Sevket Ozgur Atayilmaz, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Yildiz Technical University, who has worked on fire safety planning.",
      "\"If the structure is designed correctly for fire, if there are escape routes, and if the smoke is evacuated correctly, it is possible to overcome the fire without loss of life.\"",
      "The interior minister said there were two fire escapes, but there are indications they were not of a good standard.",
      "Were fire safety measures in place?",
      "An official from the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) in Bolu, Erol Percin, said the way the fire had spread suggested that fire warning, detection and extinguishing systems might not have been present.",
      "He said the building's exterior wooden facade should have been 100% fire-resistant, but that did not appear to be the case.",
      "The head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation told the BBC that the size of the fire suggested that \"the fire system either does not exist or was not designed in accordance with the standards\".",
      "There were 238 people staying in the Grand Kartal Hotel at the time.",
      "Kazim Beceren said fire safety systems were designed with the aim of taking three minutes to evacuate each floor - and a facility with more than 200 people could be evacuated in 15 to 30 minutes under ideal conditions.",
      "When an alarm goes off, the person in charge of the fire control dashboard is expected to check the location, according to the head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation.",
      "If there is no indication of a false alarm or if a second detector sends a warning, fire alarms are then normally activated throughout the building.",
      "In a properly installed system, people are then directed by announcement to the nearest fire exits, with flashing lights for people who are hearing-impaired or audible warnings for those sleeping.",
      "As fires can spread very quickly, sprinkler systems are seen as highly important for intervention at an early stage.",
      "So too is a back-up power source. According to fire protection regulations, signs pointing to emergency exits and lights showing the paths to these exits have to work for one to three hours, even if there is a power outage.",
      "The engineers' and architects' union in Bolu said in a statement that \"an automatic sprinkler system is mandatory\" in buildings of this size.",
      "\"The photos on the hotel's website show that the automatic sprinkler system, which was supposed to be installed in 2008, was not installed. Because of this failure, the fire spread rapidly and there were casualties.\"",
      "BBC Turkish has not been able to independently confirm the allegations about either the wooden cladding on the building or the hotel's fire extinguishing system.",
      "Who checked the hotel's fire safety?",
      "One of the big questions is whether the hotel's fire systems were properly inspected.",
      "Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan said the ministry of tourism was responsible as the hotel was beyond the boundary of his town. Erol Percin agreed.",
      "The mayor said that the last time Bolu's municipality had given a report stating the hotel was fireproof was in 2007, and there had been no such checks since then.",
      "However, Culture and Tourism Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel did have a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\" and inspections were down to them.",
      "There have also been calls for relatively old structures to come under scrutiny because of changing legislation.",
      "\"Places should stop operating if they  do not comply with current standards, in crowded places such as hotels, residences, nursing homes or kindergartens,\" says Prof Atayilmaz of Yildiz Technical University."

      "Like all the Sudanese women who the BBC spoke to about their experiences of being trafficked to Libya, her name has been changed to protect her identity.",
      "Warning: This story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "In a trembling voice she explains how her home in Omdurman had been raided during Sudan's violent civil war, which erupted in 2023.",
      "The family went to Egypt first before paying traffickers $350 (\u00a3338) to take them to Libya, where they had been told life would be better and they would be able to find jobs in cleaning and hospitality.",
      "But as soon as they crossed the border, Layla says the traffickers held them hostage, beat them and demanded more money.",
      "\"My son needed medical attention after he was hit repeatedly in the face,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "The traffickers released them after three days, without saying why. Layla thought her new life in Libya was starting to get better after the family managed to travel west and she rented a room and started working.",
      "But one day her husband left to look for work and never returned. Then her 19-year-old daughter was raped by a man known to the family through Layla's job.",
      "\"He told my daughter he would rape her younger sister if she spoke about what he did to her,\" Layla says.",
      "She speaks in hushed tones fearing the family will be evicted if their landlady hears about the threats.",
      "Layla says they are now trapped in Libya: they have no money left to pay traffickers to leave and cannot return to war-torn Sudan.",
      "\"We have barely any food,\" she says, adding that her children are not in school. \"My son is afraid to leave the house as other children often beat him and insult him for being black. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.\"",
      "Millions have fled Sudan since the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in 2023. The two sides had jointly staged a coup in 2021, but a power struggle between their commanders plunged the country into civil war.",
      "More than 12 million people have been forced from their homes, while famine has spread to five areas, with 24.6 million people - about half the population - in urgent need of food aid, experts say.",
      "The UN refugee agency says more than 210,000 Sudanese refugees are now in Libya.",
      "The BBC has spoken to five Sudanese families who initially went to Egypt, where they said they experienced racism and violence, before moving to Libya, believing it would be safer with better job opportunities. We contacted them through a researcher in migration and asylum seeker issues in Libya.",
      "Salma tells the BBC she was already living in Cairo, in Egypt, with her husband and three children when the Sudanese civil war broke out, but as huge numbers of refugees entered the country, conditions for migrants there worsened.",
      "They decided to move to Libya, but what was awaiting them there was a \"living hell\", Salma says.",
      "She describes how, as soon as they crossed the border, they were placed in a warehouse run by traffickers. The men wanted money that had been paid in advance to traffickers on the Egyptian side of the border, but it never arrived.",
      "Her family spent nearly two months in the warehouse. At one point, Salma was separated from her husband and taken to a room for women and children. Here, she says she and her two eldest children were subjected to various forms of brutality because they wanted the money.",
      "\"Their whips left marks on our bodies. They would beat my daughter and put my son's hands in a lit oven while I was watching.",
      "\"Sometimes I wished we would all die together. I could think of no other way out.\"",
      "Salma says her son and daughter were traumatised by the experience and have suffered from incontinence since. She then lowers her voice.",
      "\"They would take me to a separate room, the 'rape room' with different men each time,\" she says. \"I bear the child of one of them.\"",
      "Eventually, she raised some money through a friend in Egypt and the traffickers released the family.",
      "She says a doctor then told her it was too late for an abortion, and when her husband found out she was pregnant he abandoned her and the children, leaving them to sleep rough, eating leftovers from rubbish bins and begging in the street.",
      "They found refuge on a remote farm in north-western Libya for a while, spending whole days with little to no food. They quenched their thirst by drinking contaminated water from a nearby well.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to hear my [older] son saying he is literally dying from hunger,\" Salma says over the phone, as the cries of her baby grow louder in the background.",
      "\"He is so hungry,\" she says, \"but I have nothing, not even enough milk in my breasts to feed him.\"",
      "Jamila, a Sudanese woman in her mid-40s, also believed reports within the Sudanese community that a better life awaited them in Libya.",
      "She fled previous unrest in Sudan's western region of Darfur in 2014 and spent years in Egypt before moving to Libya in late 2023. She says her daughters have been raped repeatedly since then - they were 19 and 20 when it first happened.",
      "\"I sent them for a cleaning job while I was ill; they came back at night covered with dirt and blood - four men raped them until one of them fainted,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Jamila says she was also raped and held captive for weeks by a man, much younger than her, who had offered her a job cleaning his house.",
      "\"He used to call me a 'disgusting black'. He raped me and said, 'This is what women were made for,'\" she recalls.",
      "\"Even kids here are mean to us, they treat us as beasts and sorcerers, they insult us for being black and African, are they not Africans themselves?\" Jamila says.",
      "When her daughters were raped the first time, Jamila took them to hospital and reported it to police. But when the police officer realised they were refugees, Jamila says he withdrew the report and warned her that she would be jailed if the complaint was officially filed. This was in the west of Libya.",
      "Libya is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 protocol relating to the Status of Refugees - and considers refugees and asylum-seekers \"illegal migrants\".",
      "The country is divided into two, with each part run by a different government, but the situation is easier for migrants in the east as they can file official complaints without being detained, and access healthcare more easily, according to human rights group Libya Crimes Watch.",
      "While sexual violence is common within unofficial facilities run by traffickers, there is also evidence that abuse is happening in official detention centres in Libya, especially in the west.",
      "Hanaa, a Sudanese woman who works gathering plastic bottles from bins to feed her children, says she was abducted in western Libya and taken to a forest and raped at gunpoint by a group of men.",
      "The next day her attackers took her to a facility run by the state-funded Stability Support Authority (SSA). Nobody told Hanaa why she had been detained.",
      "\"Young men and boys were beaten and forced to completely remove their clothes while I was watching,\" Hanaa tells the BBC.",
      "\"I was there for days. I slept on the bare floor, resting my head on my plastic slippers. They would let me go to the toilet after hours of begging. I was repeatedly beaten on the head.\"",
      "There have been numerous previous reports of migrants from other African countries being abused in Libya. The country is a key stepping stone on the way to Europe, although none of the women the BBC spoke to planned to travel there.",

    "title": "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Thailand is set to legalise same-sex marriage - one of the few places in Asia to do so. Why is it an outlier?",
    "story": [
      "\"It has been a long fight full of tears for us.\"",
      "That is how Ann \"Waaddao\" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment \u2013 on Thursday, when same-sex marriage becomes legal in Thailand, and more than a hundred couples will tie the knot in one of Bangkok's biggest shopping malls, in a riot of colour and celebration.",
      "And the same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed will be asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?",
      "People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. Thai people are easy-going about pretty much everything. \"Mai pen rai\" \u2013 no big deal \u2013 is a national catch-phrase. Buddhist beliefs, followed by more than 90% of Thais, don't forbid LGBT lifestyles. Surely, then, equal marriage was inevitable.",
      "Except it wasn't. \"It was not easy,\" says Ms Waaddao, who organises Bangkok Pride March.",
      "The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. After 2006 only two marches took place until 2022. In 2009 one planned Pride march in Chiang Mai had to be abandoned because of the threat of violence.",
      "\"We were not accepted, by our own families and by society,\" Ms Waaddao adds. \"There were times when we did not think marriage equality would ever happen, but we never gave up.\"",
      "'We did not fight, we negotiated'",
      "For all of Thailand's general tolerance of LGBT people, getting equal rights, including marriage, required a determined campaign to change attitudes in Thai officialdom and society. And attitudes have changed.",
      "When Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira started dating his partner in 2001, they were both actors playing leading roles in TV series. At that time homosexuality was still officially described by the Thai Ministry of Health as a mental illness.",
      "Are you in a same sex relationship in Thailand? Get in touch.",
      "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples",
      "Why legalising gay sex in India is not a Western idea",
      "\"Back then society could not accept leading male roles being played by a gay man. There was lots of gossip about us in the media, much of it untrue, which really stressed us,\" Mr Chakkrit recalls.",
      "\"We decided then that if we were going to date each other, we had to leave showbiz.\"",
      "They are still together but they have stayed out of the limelight for more than 20 years, running a successful production company.",
      "A lot has changed in that time \u2013 and their industry gets some credit for that.",
      "The way LGBT characters are portrayed in Thai TV dramas, from comical oddities to mainstream roles, made a big difference, according to Tinnaphop Sinsomboonthong, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who self-identifies as queer.",
      "\"Nowadays they represent us as normal characters, like you see in real life,\" he says. \"The kind of LGBTQ+ colleague you might have in the office, or your LGBTQ+ neighbour.  This really helped change perceptions and values in all generations.\"",
      "The so-called Boy Love dramas have helped bring the rest of society round to the idea of not just tolerance, but full acceptance and equal rights for the community.",
      "These romantic television dramas featuring love affairs between beautiful young men have grown enormously in popularity over the past decade, especially during the Covid pandemic.",
      "They are now one of Thailand's most successful cultural exports, with huge audiences in places like China. Series like My School President and Love Sick have got hundreds of millions of views on streaming networks.",
      "At the same time, activists became more focused and united in their bid to get the law changed. The many different LGBT groups came together in the Change 1448 campaign \u2013 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage \u2013 and later under the Rainbow Coalition for Marriage Equality.",
      "They linked up with other groups fighting for greater rights and freedoms in Thailand, and they learned to work with political parties in parliament to persuade them to change their stance on the law.",
      "The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognise and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.",
      "\"We did not fight, we negotiated,\" Mr Tinnaphop says. \"We knew we had to talk to Thai society, and little by little, we shifted attitudes.\"",
      "The right political moment",
      "Getting the equal marriage law through parliament was also helped by political developments in Thailand.",
      "For five years following a coup in 2014, the country was ruled by a conservative military government, which was willing only to consider recognising civil partnerships for LGBT couples, without full rights like inheritance.",
      "But in the 2019 election which returned Thailand to civilian rule, a new, youthful reformist party called Future Forward, which fully supported equal marriage, did unexpectedly well. They won the third-largest share of seats, revealing a growing hunger for change in Thailand.",
      "When a year later Future Forward was dissolved by a controversial court verdict, it set off months of student-led protests calling for sweeping reforms, including curbs to the monarchy's power.",
      "LGBT campaigners were prominent in those protests, giving them greater national prominence. The protests eventually died down, with many of the leaders arrested for questioning the monarchy's role.",
      "But in the 2023 election the successor to Future Forward, calling itself Move Forward, performed even better than in 2019, winning more seats than any other party. Again, it was clear that the desire for change was felt across Thai people of all ages.",
      "Move Forward was blocked from forming a government by conservatives who objected to its call for wholesale political reforms.",
      "But by this time, equal marriage was less contentious. Few opposed it. And passing it gave the unwieldy and unpopular coalition government which had been formed without Move Forward a quick accomplishment with which to please most of the country.",
      "Pioneering move may boost tourism",
      "Thailand, though, is an outlier in Asia. Few other countries in the region are likely to follow suit.",
      "The influence of Islam in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei makes the notion of equal marriage a non-starter. LGBT communities there face discrimination and prosecution; in Brunei sex between men carries the death penalty.",
      "In the Philippines, there is growing acceptance of LGBT couples living together openly. But the Roman Catholic Church vehemently opposes same-sex marriage.",
      "In Vietnam, like Thailand, there are no religious or ideological obstacles, but campaigning to change the law, as happened in Thailand, is difficult under a repressive regime. Much the same is true in China. Until the ruling communist party endorses equal marriage, which it shows no signs of doing, it cannot happen.",
      "Even in democracies like Japan and South Korea \u2013 where political parties are largely conservative and dominated by older men - the prospects look bleak.",
      "\"It is largely conservative Christians who are blocking it,\" says Chae-yoon Han, executive director of the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in South Korea.",
      "\"Most, if not all, politicians in the conservative party of President Yoon are devout Christians, and they have framed marriage equality as a 'leftist agenda', which could potentially open society to a 'leftist, communist takeover'.\"",
      "India appeared close to legalising same-sex marriage in 2023, when the decision fell to its Supreme Court - but the judges declined, saying it was up to parliament.",
      "So Thailand hopes to benefit from being a pioneer. Tourism is one of the few areas of the Thai economy doing well in the post-pandemic recovery, and the country is seen as a safe and welcoming destination for LGBT holiday-makers.",
      "Growing numbers of same-sex couples from other Asian countries are choosing to live here now.",
      "The legal recognition they can get for their marriages will allow them to raise children and grow old together with nearly all the rights and protections given to heterosexual couples.",

      "Trump has re-implemented his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy from his first term. This returned about 70,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers across the border to await hearings, before being cancelled by President Joe Biden.",
      "The same order demands the end of \"catch and release\", a policy that allows migrants to live in US communities while they await their hearings. Trump has previously promised \"the largest deportation program in American history\", but this could face legal and logistical challenges.",
      "The order also shut down a major Biden-era immigration pipeline: a sponsorship initiative that allowed up to 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the US. It had been designed to cut illegal crossings.",
      "Death penalty for some immigrant criminals",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:07:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The Lose Control singer talks about masculine role models, becoming a father, and facing prejudice.",
    "story": [
      "When Teddy Swims turned up to the  MTV Awards last September, he was nominated for four prizes, including best new artist.",
      "In the event, the combined forces of Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter denied him a single Moon Man trophy \u2013 but the singer left with something much more valuable.",
      "\"I didn't realise until a couple of weeks later, but my partner and I conceived that night,\" he beams.",
      "\"We're due in June and things are great. I think we're gonna crush it.\"",
      "Domestic bliss isn't a quality that fans might associate with Teddy Swims.",
      "His huge breakthrough single Lose Control, and the hit album I've Tried Everything But Therapy, were rooted in dysfunction, addiction and heartbreak.",
      "They were inspired by a toxic, mutually destructive relationship from which he had escaped. In the past, he has described it as a \"really co-dependent lifestyle\" that went from \"bender to bender\" as both sides \"leveraged each other's shame against one another\".",
      "As he sings on a recent single, \"I saved my life when I showed you the door\".",
      "But that was only one chapter in the story of the 32-year-old Georgia native Jaten Dimsdale.",
      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",
      "\"I'm almost scared to have him as a granddad, because I want my kids to think I'm cool, too.\""

      "The continent had a bumpy ride last time he was in the White House. Many fear Trump 2.0 could be a lot worse. And Europe's traditional powers are already struggling with their own problems.",
      "France and Germany are mired in political and economic woes, the EU as a whole lags behind China and the US in terms of competitiveness, while in the UK, public services are in a woeful state.",
      "So: is the continent prepared for Donald Trump or has it been caught napping at the wheel (again)?",
      "A businessman who dismisses alliances",
      "When it comes to trade and defence, Trump acts more like a transactional businessman than a US statesman who prizes transatlantic alliances dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"He simply doesn't believe in win-win partnerships,\" the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel told me. She experienced Trump last time he was in office and concluded he views the world through the prism of winners and losers.",
      "He's convinced that Europe has taken advantage of the US for years and that's got to stop.",
      "Leaders in Europe have watched open-mouthed these last weeks since Trump won the US presidential election, for the second time. He's chosen to publicly lambast allies in Europe and Canada, rather than focus his ire on those he recognises as a strategic threat, like China.",
      "Trump dangles the possibility of abandoning Nato - the transatlantic military alliance that Europe has relied on for its security for decades. He has said he'd \"encourage\" Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" with European allies if they \"don't pay\" their way more and boost their defence spending.",
      "When it comes to trade, Trump is clearly as livid with the EU now as he was during his first term in office. The bloc sells far more to the United States than it imports from the US. In January 2022, the trade surplus was \u20ac15.4 billion (\u00a313 billion).",
      "Donald Trump's answer? He says he'll impose blanket tariffs on all foreign imports of 10-20%, with even higher tariffs on certain goods like cars.",
      "That's a disaster scenario for Germany, which relies on exports and the automobile industry in particular. Its economy is already spluttering - last year it shrunk by 0.2%.",

      "\"What he said in the past is things like, he doesn't want to see any Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York. Now, this is kind of nuts, because, actually, most of the Mercedes-Benz that you see on the streets of New York are made in Alabama, where Mercedes has a big plant.",
      "\"He has often been more hostile to Germany than any other country in Europe. It might be slightly easier for Germany with a new and more conservative government (after the upcoming general election), but I wouldn't be holding my breath.\"",
      "The UK hopes to avoid Trump tariffs as it doesn't have such a trade imbalance with the US, but it may well get lashed by tail winds if it comes to an EU-US trade war.",
      "How prepared Europe is, really",
      "Trump's bullish style can come as no surprise to allies after his first term in the White House. The real conundrum for Europe now is his unpredictability: How much is bluster and intimidation and how much is a promise of action?",
      "Ian Lesser, vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank, believes Trump's tariff threats are real and that Europe is far from ready.",
      "\"They're not prepared, no one really is. This very different approach to global trade upsets many cornerstones of the international economy, which has evolved over decades.\"",
      "The European Commission claims to be ready for any number of moves by Trump when he returns to the White House. It is a huge trade power on the world stage. But Mr Lesser says the biggest impact on Europe could come if Trump launches an aggressive trade war against China. That could result in supply chain disruptions for Europe and Beijing dumping even more cheap products on European markets, to the detriment of local businesses.",
      "\"For Europe it's double exposure: exposure to what America might do and then what China will do in response.\"",
      "Trade, defence and the Musk factor",
      "What complicates things further is that trade and defence aren't separate issues for Trump and his administration. He recently refused to rule out economic and/or military action against EU and Nato member Denmark if it didn't hand over the autonomous territory Greenland to the US.",
      "And Trump's incoming vice president appeared, this autumn, to make US defence of Europe conditional on EU regulatory bodies stepping away from the social platform X.",
      "JD Vance warned the US could pull its support for Nato if the EU continued a longstanding investigation into X, which is owned by Trump's Golden Boy, Elon Musk.",
      "Recently, Mr Musk also displayed a keenness for taking sides in European politics. He launched repeated online attacks against centre-left European leaders Sir Keir Starmer in the UK and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk posted on X that the extreme anti-migration AfD party was Germany's only hope.",
      "This shocked many in Europe but pollsters suggest Mr Musk's controversial posts have little actual influence on European public opinion.",
      "Trump and Mr Musk are widely distrusted in Europe, as clearly illustrated in a new poll commissioned by the European Council of Foreign Relations, entitled The EU and global public opinion after the US elections.",
      "From ego flattering to flashing cash",
      "In the end, different European leaders have different approaches to \"Taming the Trump,\" as insiders describe attempts. Some flatter his not-exactly-tiny ego.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is the expert here. He was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on social media after his re-election in November and he swiftly invited him to attend the glittering and dignitary-resplendent re-opening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.",
      "When he was first in the White House, President Macron wowed Trump as guest of honour at the annual display of pomp and military might of Bastille Day in Paris.",
      "The UK, meanwhile, knows Trump has a soft spot for Scotland, where his mother comes from, and for the British Royal Family. He visibly relished attending a state banquet with the now-late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. He heaped praise on Prince William after sitting down with him this autumn.",
      "Others in Europe favour flashing the cash.",
      "European Central Bank (ECB) chief, Christine Lagarde, has advised Europe's leaders to adopt a \"cheque-book strategy\" and negotiate with Trump rather than retaliate against his proposed tariffs.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, speaks of buying more (expensive) US liquified natural gas (LNG) as part of Europe's effort to diversify its energy supplies. It has been weaning itself off a reliance on cheap Russian gas since the Kremlin launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Sources in the Commission also speak of possibly buying more US agricultural products and weapons.",
      "Should Europe be more self-sufficient?",
      "Macron, meanwhile, has long advocated what he calls \"strategic autonomy\" - essentially Europe learning to be more self-sufficient, in order to survive.",
      "\"Europe... can die and that depends entirely on our choices,\" he said this spring.",
      "Covid showed Europe how dependent it was on Chinese imports, like medicines. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe's over-reliance on Russian energy.",
      "Macron is now sounding the alarm about the US: \"The United States of America has two priorities. The USA first, and that is legitimate, and the China issue, second. And the European issue is not a geopolitical priority for the coming years and decades.\"",
      "Trump's return to the White House is making European leaders think about continental weaknesses.",
      "The big question around defence",
      "When it comes to defence, Trump's insistence that Europe spend more is generally accepted (though how much more is a hot topic of debate). But where Trump talks in terms of increasing GDP spending, Europeans are discussing how to spend their defence budgets more wisely and in a more joined-up way to boost continental safety.",
      "Emmanuel Macron wants an EU-wide industrial defence policy. He says the war in Ukraine illustrated that \"our fragmentation is a weakness... We have sometimes discovered ourselves, as Europeans, that our guns were not of the same calibre, that our missiles did not match.\"",
      "Europe frets that Trump will not want to continue being the main sponsor of military aid to Ukraine as was the case under the Biden administration.",
      "Next month, EU leaders have invited the UK - one of Europe's two big military powers - to an informal summit to discuss working together better on security and defence.",
      "The EU's defence chief and former Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, believes European unity of purpose is needed. \"We need to act in a united way. Then, we are strong. Then, we are also serious on the world stage.\"",
      "Weaker and more fractured? Europe today",
      "There are analysts who say Europe is in a far weaker, more fractured state to deal with Trump 2.0 than it was in 2016 when he was first elected. I'd say the answer to that is yes. But also no.",
      "Yes - as discussed, economic growth is sluggish and politics are volatile.",
      "Populist nationalist eurosceptic parties are gaining strength in many European countries. Some, like Germany's AfD, are soft on Moscow - while others like Italian PM Giorgia Meloni may be tempted to prioritise transatlantic ties with Trump rather than European unity.",
      "But beware of looking back at Europe when Trump was first elected president through rose-tinted spectacles.",
      "Financially, northern Europe was definitely doing better than it is now, but, in terms of unity, the continent was deeply divided on the back of the migrant crisis in 2015. Populist eurosceptic parties were also on the rise then and, following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there were widespread predictions the EU would soon lose other member countries and fall apart altogether.",
      "Fast forward to 2025 and the EU has weathered Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the migration crisis and Trump's first term in office - and countries very much pulled together after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It was more of a stumbling, rather than sailing through these successive crises, but the EU is still standing and the wounds of Brexit, for example, have healed with time.",
      "Post-Brexit UK is seen by the EU as a close ally that shares the same values in a world threatened by an ambitious China, an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable, bullish incoming US president.",
      "Nato, meanwhile, though worried about Trump's commitment to the alliance, has been boosted militarily and geostrategically by Sweden and Russian neighbour Finland becoming members following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Maybe, just maybe, Trump will see fewer differences that frustrate and antagonise him about Europe this time round.",
      "It's a Europe that recognises the need to spend more on defence, as he demands; that is far warier of China, as he expects, and that is more right-leaning in its politics, as he prefers.",
      "Is it a Europe whose leaders also stand up to Trump, despite threats and bluster, if they feel he crosses a line - be it over human rights, free speech or dallying with dictators?",

      "He started talking at a little after noon on Monday, and it seemed at times like he didn't stop talking \u2013 at ad-libbed remarks later at the Capitol, at his indoor parade rally at a downtown sports arena and at the White House executive order signing \u2013 until well into the evening.",
      "Through it all, Trump demonstrated the kind of dramatic flair and penchant for controversy and confrontation that has energised his supporters and infuriated his critics.",
      "During his inaugural address, Trump paid particular attention to immigration and the economy \u2013 issues that polls suggest American voters cared about most last year. He also promised to end government-promoted diversity programmes and noted that US official policy would only recognise two genders, male and female.",
      "That last line generated an enthusiastic response at the Capitol and wild cheers from his crowd of supporters gathered at a nearby sport arena. It's a sign that cultural issues - where he drew the most vivid contrasts with Democrats in last year's election - will continue to be one of Trump's most powerful ways the new president connects with his base.",
      "Before he outlined what this new age would entail, however, Trump painted a dark picture of the current American political climate.",

      "LIVE - latest updates and analysis",
      "As his predecessor, Joe Biden, and other Democrats sat stone-faced to one side, Trump said the government faces a \"crisis of trust\". He condemned the \"vicious, violent and unfair weaponisation\" of the US Justice Department, which had investigated and attempted to prosecute him for contesting the 2020 election results.",
      "He claimed a mandate to reverse \"horrible betrayals\" and lashed out at a \"radical and corrupt establishment\" that he said extracted power and wealth from America's citizens.",
      "It was the kind of populist, anti-elite rhetoric that has been a staple of Trump's speeches for a decade. Unlike when Trump first began his ascent to the pinnacles of US political power in 2015, however, Trump represents the current emerging establishment as much as any one man. And sitting behind him on the dais were a collection of some of the wealthiest, and most influential, corporate leaders in the world.",
      "On the day of his inauguration, Trump has the attention \u2013 and the initiative. His aides have promised hundreds of executive actions \u2013 on a range of subjects, including immigration, energy, trade, education and hot-button cultural issues.",
      "In his inaugural address, he detailed a handful of them. He pledged to declare national emergencies on energy and immigration, allowing him to put the US military on the border, drastically limit the rights of asylum-seekers and reopen large swaths of federal land to energy extraction. He repeated his pledge to change the name of Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" and to take back the Panama Canal.",
      "He made an unfounded claim that China was running the key waterway and said that US ships, including naval vessels, were paying too much in transit fees \u2013 perhaps a hint at the real objective in future negotiations with the Panamanian government.",
      "\"The US will once again consider itself a growing nation,\" he said, pledging to increase American wealth and expand \"our territory\".",
      "That last bit might catch the ear of US allies, who have already been concerned by Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland and quips about making Canada the 51st US state.",
      "On the campaign trail, and in this speech, Trump made a series of big promises. Now that he is president, he will be challenged to deliver \u2013 and show what the \"golden age\" he heralds actually means.",
      "After Trump concluded his speech and saw Biden depart via a Marine helicopter, he gave off-the-cuff remarks at a gathering of supporters elsewhere in the Capitol. It was there that the more unscripted Trump \u2013 the one who frequently generates headlines and turns American politics on its head \u2013 reemerged.",
      "The 2020 election was \"rigged\", he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was criminally responsible for the 6 January, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. He boasted about the size of his 2024 election victory and said he grudgingly agreed to talk about \"unity\" in his inaugural address.",
      "It was just a taste of what was in store for the rest of the day \u2013 and for the next four years.",
      "At a signing ceremony in the evening,  Trump took an ordinary presidential act \u2013 rescinding orders from a previous administration of different party \u2013 and turned it into spectacle.",
      "After giving another winding speech \u2013 his third of the day \u2013 Trump moved to a small desk on the stage at the downtown sport arena where his indoor inaugural parade had just concluded. Then he went to work freezing new federal regulations and hiring, reversing Biden administration directives, mandating federal workers work in-office full-time and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords.",
      "\"Can you imagine Joe Biden doing this?\" he asked after signing the regulation freeze \u2013 but that applied to the moment as much as the content of the orders.",
      "He also signed more symbolic orders to end the \"weaponisation of government\" and instruct his administration to address the higher cost of living.",
      "After the arena ceremony, Trump tossed the pens he used into the crowd \u2013 another Trumping flourish.",
      "Then he went back to the White House, and executive orders continued \u2013 pardoning nearly all of the 1,600-plus supporters arrested in the 6 January Capitol riot, temporarily suspending the TikTok ban and withdrawing the US from the World Health Organisation.",
      "He also reinterpreted a key constitutional amendment and instructed his administration to cease granting citizenship to US-born children of undocumented migrants.",
      "All the while, he offered a running commentary \u2013 including proposing a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada starting on 1 February,  accusing Democrats of cheating in the 2020 election and expressing doubt about the Gaza War ceasefire.",
      "Trump returns to power with a team that has a detailed strategy for governing and an aggressive agenda to pursue. Trump himself, however, can still be as unpredictable and unfocused as ever \u2013 making remarks that could represent new policy or just a momentary distraction.",
      "The second Trump era has truly begun.",

      "In 2020, Rogan endorsed Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders but shortly before the 2024 election, he endorsed Trump.",

      "In 2022, Rogan apologised after footage emerged of him repeatedly using the n-word in early episodes of his show.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times, was pictured with his fifth wife Elena Zhukova.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:18:55 -0500",
    "summary": "As the Palisades Fire exploded in his hometown, the actor was moving abandoned cars so emergency vehicles could get through. He spoke about the importance of making a difference; and about caring for his late father, Stanley, whom he calls his \"anchor.\"",
    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "It was the tail end of June 1968; the air was starting to get humid. Fourth grade was ending, and I could feel the three months of delirium that was coming.",
      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",
      "And wouldn't you know it? Someone noticed.",
      "\"What the hell is going on?\" I heard my mother say downstairs. \"Stanley, I smell smoke.\"",
      "\"Check the air conditioners,\" my father said. \"I'm going to look at the attic.\"",
      "I heard my father's footsteps as he rushed up to the attic, praying that he would skip past the bathroom I'd turned into my private gunpowder studio. But then he started banging on the door.",
      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",
      "He reached into the drawer and, with one giant hand, grabbed the bulk of them.",
      "\"Follow me.\"",
      "We headed outside. I was sure that we were going to the garbage pails, but he walked right past them.",
      "\"You and me are going to light every firecracker in these belts and finish them off.\"",
      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",

    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "\"Affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA's efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all. They are most frequently composted on site, as part of the efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Eric Deeble, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told reporters last week.",
      "While bird flu has largely spared many of the humans and cows sickened by this past year's outbreaks in the U.S. from death or severe disease, officials have warned that the virus is especially lethal to cats.",
      "In response, the FDA said Friday it would order manufacturers of uncooked cat and dog foods to take steps to curb further spread.",
      "Potential risks of raw pet food",
      "Raw and minimally processed pet foods make up a minority of U.S. pet food sales, but the consulting firm OC&C said\u00a0last year\u00a0that there's been \"rapid growth\" in the market.",
      "The American Animal Hospital Association says it does not endorse feeding pets raw protein food. The group warns that \"overwhelming scientific evidence\" shows it puts animals and the humans around them at risk of disease.",
      "To comply with the new requirements, producers either need to start cooking their products or come up with another way to cut the risk in their food safety plans.",
      "\"As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to significantly minimize or prevent H5N1 transmission through animal food,\" the agency said.",
      "The move also prompted the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to step up oversight of turkey slaughter, after a bird flu strain detected in raw pet food and an infected cat was linked to a turkey flock.",
      "Under the program, APHIS said it would require turkeys to undergo isolation and extra testing in some states before they could be slaughtered.",
      "Health officials in California last year had warned against feeding pets recalled raw milk and a local raw pet food brand, Monarch Raw Pet Food, after a probe of cat deaths. Monarch has disputed the allegation, saying there is \"no credible evidence\" that their products were to blame.",
      "Oregon's agriculture department also warned of an outbreak last year also linked to raw turkey pet food by Northwest Naturals, which had been sold in a dozen states and Canada. Officials in Oregon confirmed to CBS News this month that the FDA had taken over the investigation.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks in poultry and dairy herds",
      "U.S. officials and farmers have braced in recent winters for an uptick in outbreaks, as migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south from Canada.",
      "This winter's migration started around a month later than usual, U.S. officials say, delaying when the surge of bird flu began to hit farmers hard.",
      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",
      "Turner said they expect that could lead to the surge in bird flu subsiding a month later, as the amount of virus lingering in the environment from their migration starts to wind down.",
      "\"Now that they are predominantly kind of where they're going to be for the winter, there's a little bit less of that migratory movement and exposure,\" said Turner.",
      "This is on top of ongoing outbreaks from a different strain that spilled over into dairy herds in 2023. That virus has spread back from cows to birds at nearby poultry farms in some cases.",
      "That may be what happened in Northwest Naturals. Oregon's agriculture department said the strain in the turkey product was B3.13, the same as the bird flu virus fueling the dairy outbreaks.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",
      "Fluoridation opponents argue that modern toothpaste is enough to make up for stopping water fluoridation, citing communities that do not add the chemical to their water supply.",

      "A year after the American Academy of Pediatrics flagged what it described as \"questionable marketing practices\" by makers of formulas for older infants and toddlers, Abbott Laboratories is being sued over how it pitches such products.",
      "Abbott, a health care products conglomerate based in Illinois, is misleading parents and other caregivers about the nutritional value of its sugar-laden toddler milks, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) against the maker of Similac formulas.",
      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",

      "\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said George Fuchs, a medical doctor and professor of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. \"The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives,\" noted Fuchs, who led the AAP report on toddler milks.",
      "Labeled similarly to FDA-regulated infant formulas and sold on the same store shelves, Abbott's \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink by Similac\" and \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink by Similac\" are labeled \"Stage 3,\" implying they are the next nutritionally recommended product after \"Stage 1\" infant formula and \"Stage 2\" transitional formula, the suit alleges.",
      "\"Common toddler milk marketing practices, including unsubstantiated nutrition-related claims and packages that look like infant formulas, mislead parents and other caregivers to believe that toddler milks provide nutritional benefits for their young children,\" said Dr. Jennifer Harris, senior research adviser, marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.",

      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",

      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",

      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",

      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",

      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

    "story": [
      "A sweeping federal cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing multiple lawsuits, with the litigation coinciding with President Trump's January\u00a0inauguration.",
      "One suit, filed Monday by a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors, claims DOGE is operating as a federal advisory committee. That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit was filed shortly after noon Eastern time in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, National Security Counselors told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The law requires that advisory committees are \"objective and accessible to the public,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "A coalition representing veterans, public health professionals, teachers and other groups also filed a suit Monday against DOGE, citing FACA and asking a court to block DOGE's activities until it complies with law.",
      "\"The question every American should be asking is 'What are they hiding?'\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"DOGE must not be allowed to operate in the shadows without the transparency, oversight, and opportunity for public participation required of any federal department by the law.\"",
      "Neither the Trump campaign nor Elon Musk immediately responded to a request for comment. Ramaswamy is expected to step away from DOGE as he embarks on a campaign for Ohio governor later this month.",
      "DOGE breaking the law?",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

      "But the fact that the announcements came on Trump's official social media channels seemed to reassure the market, as did the fact that Trump has used one of the companies behind the project, CIC Digital LLC, in the past to sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs).",
      "By mid-morning on Saturday, the market capitalization for $TRUMP stood at nearly $6 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com.",

    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:06:30 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "\"Taking control of your finances can absolutely help you feel more in control of your life overall, and that sense of control is incredibly important for mental well-being,\" Berwise said. \"A big part of financial stress comes from focusing on things we can't control \u2014 like rising prices or taxes.

      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:04:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously found the new law that could lead to a ban of TikTok does not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat.",
      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear. Following the ruling, the White House said the Biden administration would not enforce the ban on Sunday, and would leave it to the Trump administration.

Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",
      "\"I had a very good experience with TikTok,\" he said.",
      "Chew, the TikTok CEO,\u00a0met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida resort, in December, and is expected to attend the president-elect's inauguration Monday.",

Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",

      "Trump claims Biden lost track of over 300,000 migrant children. Here's a fact check.",
      "\"You're just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it's okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\" said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",

      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",

      "Dangerous conditions",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following\u00a0the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",

      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\"The Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\" the Department said.",
      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",

    "summary": "Cash App-owner Block must offer up to $120 million in refunds to consumers who federal regulators say were exposed to potential fraud.",
    "story": [
      "Block, the parent company of popular online payment service Cash App, has been ordered by a federal agency to pay as much as $175 million because of repeated failures by the financial services provider to protect customers from fraud.",
      "Block has agreed to pay up to $120 million to consumers harmed by fraudulent transactions and unfair business practices detailed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a consent order filed on Thursday. The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",
      "\"Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.\"",
      "Block disputes the CFPB's findings.",
      "\"While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what's best for our customers and our business,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",
      "Block made $7.5 billion in gross profit in 2023, roughly $4 billion of which came from Cash App, according to the CFPB.",

    "summary": "Some Walmart shareholders say the retailer hasn't offered a good business case for canceling its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of shareholders representing $266 billion in assets are calling on Walmart to spell out the business reasons for backpedaling on the retailer's\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Investors including Amalgamated Bank and Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids said Tuesday in a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that they are \"concerned to see our company give into bullying and pressure from anti-DEI groups.\"",
      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",
      "Organized by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition that seeks to influence corporate behavior, the investors requested a meeting with Walmart leaders about the change in policy, noting they had for decades supplied data illustrating the business hazards linked to discrimination and inequity.",
      "\"Seeing the company retreat from its stated values and the business opportunities associated with a diverse and inclusive workforce is very disheartening. Additionally, Walmart has not offered a financial or business case for this change in policy,\" the investors wrote.",
      "Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The letter coincides with\u00a0another by a coalition of 14 attorneys general also\u00a0voicing concerns about Walmart's DEI announcement, made weeks after the November win at the polls by President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal opponent of DEI policies.",
      "Other companies have also moved to unwind their DEI efforts in recent weeks. Meta last week said it would pull the plug on its DEI programs, joining other corporate giants to make the move, including\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald's. The retrenchment accelerated in 2023 after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions, a decision that emboldened anti-DEI activists.",
      "Other large companies to shut down their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "Still, mamor companies including \u00a0Apple, Costco and\u00a0Target\u00a0continue to support their DEI policies. Target, for instance, is defending against itself in court against a conservative advocacy group's lawsuit\u00a0claiming\u00a0the retailer misled investors about the alleged financial risks stemming from its DEI practices.",
      "Jeff Raikes, a Costco board member, has touted the economic benefits of diverse workplaces,\u00a0posting\u00a0on social media in November that \"attacks on DEI aren't just bad for business \u2014 they hurt our economy. A diverse workforce drives innovation, expands markets and fuels growth.\"",
      "Costco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against a\u00a0proposal\u00a0to dismantle its DEI program ahead of a Jan. 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists\u00a0such as Robby Starbuck\u00a0urging boycotts of the warehouse club.",

    "story": [
      "As President Trump cemented his return to the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron told his European counterparts\u00a0this week to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce the continent's reliance on the United States for security.",
      "\"What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\" Macron said Monday, addressing members of the French military.",
      "President Trump has often criticized America's NATO allies for failing to meet domestic defense spending targets. At a February 2024 campaign rally in South Carolina, he said he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't meet the target.",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump repeated a demand he first made in January that NATO \"needs to pay 5%.\" Under a 2014 agreement made by the group, the alliance's more than 30 member states committed to aim to spend at least 2% of the value of their domestic economies on defense every year. During his first term in office, Mr. Trump pressured America's allies to meet that threshold, and some have increased their military spending since that time, but many still do not make the 2% bar.",
      "In his remarks just two days after the U.S. election in November, Macron called on Europeans \"to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy\" and to decrease reliance on U.S. military hardware and defense leadership.",
      "CBS News has spoken with analysts and former officials from several European countries and NATO following the U.S. election. The experts, from Poland, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and the NATO alliance itself, vary in their assessments of the feasibility of Macron's broad vision, but they largely agree that Europe can and should cooperate more closely and spend more money on defense.",

      "Poland - Professor Katarzyna Pisarska",
      "Chair, Warsaw Security Forum",
      "Speaking on Macron's comments:",
      "You have to remember that Macron's vision is not really a detail-oriented, ready-to-go project. It is an idea that has been discussed in Europe, and throughout the last two years, but the general direction is that we are not building anything that would be competitive to NATO. Rather, we would be creating capabilities, especially defense capabilities, that would help and strengthen the European defense pillar of NATO.",
      "The idea that we would go alone without the United States has been rejected by almost all, if not all, EU and NATO member states.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "Poland currently buys 80% of all its military stocks from the United States. It's heavily dependent on American air missile defense systems. These are not things that you can detangle or unbundle from overnight. So the majority of countries \u2014 especially from the NATO eastern flank \u2014 will tell you we will absolutely not go alone without the United States. There is no way that France, and even less so Germany, can step up to deliver the type of technological capabilities that are needed to substitute for the Americans on the ground here in Europe.",
      "Discussion has moved in the direction that it has been moving pre-Trump election: Europe has to step up with NATO, start producing more, start spending more, also developing its own capabilities. We also need to have a number of different defense elements that we procure and create by ourselves, and that should be also understandable to our American partners, although when I spoke with congressmen in April, not all of them understood that it is okay for Europeans to spend money on European equipment and not only on American or Korean equipment.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "Maybe President Emmanuel Macron has some idea since [the U.S. election] that he can yet again push the idea that European strategic autonomy is really complete independent from the United States. But I will say it again: From countries that are on the forefront of this war [in Ukraine], for countries that will have to be the first battleground of this war, which is the NATO eastern flank, that is not negotiable.",
      "We will have to do more and we will be doing more. I think what is unclear in the United States is that Europe already delivers 50% of military aid to Ukraine and 90% of financial and refugee aid to Ukraine. So stepping up has already happened to a large extent.",
      "It has to happen more. We need to have more troops. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves, but having America as an ally, not a competitor, I think this is what is very important to understand.",
      "U.K. - Alistair Burt",
      "Former Member of U.K. Parliament and minister of state for the Middle East at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and minister of state at the Department for International Development",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "We have known for some time that the United States, under whatever leadership, would be asking Europeans to spend more on their defense, and what Trump's election has done has catalyzed that now. I think you have to take people at their word, and what Trump has said about NATO in the past and what people have said about European defense, rings true. I think he's [Macron] making the point that in the end, it's up to us. You're either a supplicant or you're making the weather. And there's no reason why we should just roll over and take the world as President Trump is going to try and define it. It will still, I'm absolutely certain, be in the interests of the West to act together, but we cannot take that for granted any longer, and I think Macron is right to seize upon it.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "I noticed that Macron's speech sort of offered the invitation to those outside the EU to be part of this wider European political community that the United Kingdom has made very clear it intends to be part of. I think the United Kingdom does have a role to play in this. Clearly our military is a very important part of NATO and will always be, but I would very much believe it is in the United Kingdom's interest to act with the wider European community. It bolsters them, strengthens them, and it's in our own interests. We at least have begun to spend more on defense. Other states will have more catching up to do but I do see it in the U.K.'s political and economic and military interests to be active in relation to what Macron has been saying.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "All the rhetoric has been absolutely right, we cannot afford to let Russia win. You have the Baltic states very anxious, you have [countries] with Russian enclaves that could allow Putin to say, there are Russian people here, so we will defend their interests just as we purported to do in Ukraine. How would [those countries] feel if there was some sense that Ukraine was not being supported?",
      "On the other hand, if you take out the United States' economic and military support that is asking a great deal of the rest of us to make up. I think the rhetoric is very, very clear, in that everybody has said we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and there can't be any weakening in that. The moment you've got any possibility of that weakening, then you're effectively giving the game away.",
      "If there is to be some sort of U.S.-brokered negotiation [for Ukraine], clearly [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy wants to be in the strongest possible position. And to do that, he's got to be able to enter those negotiations with the clear determination of the rest of Europe behind him to say whatever happens, we won't let you down, but if it goes on for two, four, five years, who knows?",
      "I don't think Europe can say anything other than what it's saying, and again, I think you have to take us at our word.",
      "NATO - Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff",
      "Former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "Let's nail this for once and for all: There is one effective military alliance in Europe - a political-military alliance in Europe, in the trans-Atlantic region \u2014 and it's called NATO. NATO has a command structure. It has a doctrine. It practices regularly. It is used to moving and commanding military forces at real scale. What is the point of trying to create something where we've got 70 years, 75 years of experience with NATO? Now, of course, the problem is, what happens if America, under Trump, either pulls out of NATO, which is unlikely, or reduces its support to NATO, which is possible?",
      "The solution to that, frankly, is not to start blathering on about new formations under the European Union. It's to lean into NATO and damn well start spending money. Why is Trump and why are America likely to pull a rug from under NATO, if they do? Because the French, the Germans, the British, the Spanish, the Italians, have simply not pulled their weight in defense spending terms for most of the 75 years of NATO's existence, or certainly, at least the last, certainly the last 30 years. So, lean into NATO and really double down on NATO and double down on defense spending.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "There is one good thing, though, that the European Union can do, which is defense industries. If they can get a grip of European defense procurement in order to offset the current dependence on the Americans in order to standardize weaponry. It is ridiculous for the British to continue with its own cottage industry of making tanks, when actually the rest of Europe buys Leopard IIs, which is a perfectly good tank, from Rheinmetall [in Germany].",
      "This is going to require some real political boldness, and it is going to require a pooling and a sharing of sovereignty. It's going to require individual nations like Britain to say, okay, we're not going to make a tank. We'll buy the Leopard II.",
      "On NATO:",
      "If you start building large numbers of European [non-NATO] headquarters, they've got to come from somewhere - a European command structure. What it means is that NATO will suffer. You know, I was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, one of many Brits that go back to Montgomery. The Germans have the Chief of Staff. The Chairman of the Military Committee is a Dutchman at the moment, and he or she rotates the commanders of the joint force commands. Europe has a leading role in NATO. Europeans have leading roles in NATO. But it all comes down to really leaning in and being able to produce the troop numbers, the ships, the planes, that NATO needs to really provide an effective deterrence.",
      "Germany - Norbert Roetgen",
      "Former Chair, Bundestag (German parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "I think this definitely now is the hour of Europe, a European moment, when we have to prepare that, quite probably, America, under the Trump presidency, will stop any financial or military support for Ukraine. But perhaps we also are going to see the attempt to strike a deal between Trump and Putin, so this now means that European security definitely has to become European. So either we stand up or we give up.",
      "However, I think we, the Europeans, are not prepared, despite all the evidence that this had to be expected. Europeans are not prepared, so we have to quickly catch up. It's possible, and the political will is what is lacking most, but we will have to act in a very pragmatic way.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "We have to act in a very pragmatic way to quickly and more substantially support Ukraine, and this means that we have to compensate for the American support in terms of weapons and ammunition delivery and, in the short term, this would mean that the Europeans would have to buy weapons and ammunition on the international market, and in the mid- and longer term we will have to enhance our capabilities to better coordinate, to create bigger markets in order to scale our economies in the area of defense.",
      "Up to now, there is no sufficient political will to do what is necessary to support Ukraine in order to enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. Otherwise, the military situation on the battleground would be different. We are going to see that the United States is not contributing as they have done in the past, so there is a lack of political will, and there is only one way to change this course, and this is by doing more.",
      "This would mean that all European member states like Poland, Germany and France come together and invite other countries; for example, Britain\u2014 we should go beyond the EU because it's about the entire European architecture of security\u2014 come together. And when they come together, they should bring with them substantial additional contributions in terms of money and in terms of weapons and ammunition, and this should be done in the short term. And then they should devise a plan on how to make this a structured effort and what is necessary to be done to better coordinate, to enhance the support necessary for the defense of Ukraine. It should be done very substantially in terms of money and weapons. There are no further words needed. What is needed are deeds.",
      "On NATO:",
      "Of course, it's in the European strategic interest to be a strong part of NATO, to keep the Americans in Europe. This is not against anybody, but it is only to contribute in a stronger way to what is at the heart and what is the core of NATO, and that is European security.",
      "Italy - Natalie Tocci",
      "Director, Istituto Affari Internazionali, and former special adviser to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "He's been saying this for a long time, and in a sense the vision was right back then, and it's even more right now. He started talking about European strategic autonomy in 2017, and there wasn't a lot of appetite and traction behind the idea, given that it has traditionally been mistakenly interpreted as something that runs counter to the transatlantic relationship. So obviously now with Trump, a good idea that was good back then becomes politically relevant today.",
      "From the general concept of the idea to the action, there's a big gap, and he hasn't put forward any new concrete ideas in that respect.",
      "Generally what tends to happen is Macron says something, everyone else criticizes him, but no one really puts forward an alternative vision. So God bless Macron for at least kind of having an idea, and I think in this particular case it's even a good idea, and I do think that the election of Donald Trump is going to galvanize some action, but I'm very skeptical that the kind of action that is going to be insufficient relative to what we have to do.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "We're basically talking about 100 billion euros a year ($104 billion) for several years alongside all member states beginning to spend between 2-and-4% of GDP. This is not going to happen overnight.",
      "There's no antagonism between the EU and NATO, because, frankly speaking, as we're in the midst of a war, we can't really afford to have sort of academic conversations about the EU and NATO. What the EU can contribute is on providing the regulatory and financial incentives for Europeans to do more on defense together.",
      "However, I think there is a lot there to be worked on, and especially if some of these countries begin or increasingly pursue projects collectively. If you think about France, Italy on air defense, think about the Italian-German project on a new tank, there's a lot there that can be worked on.",
      "Does it mean that Europeans would have all defense capacities? Probably not, or certainly not in the short term, so there's still a lot of dependence on the US and US defense industry.",
      "This is not a question of just completely being self-reliant on your own defense industry, but certainly there's a lot more the European defense industry can do and a lot more that governments can do to support that consolidation and cooperation within the defense industry in Europe.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 08:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump campaigned on the promise to bring down the U.S. cost of living. That could be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",
      "Mr. Trump's order targeting prices highlights several areas for federal departments to focus on, including reducing the number of federal regulations that Trump administration officials argue has driven up the cost of living for American families.",
      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday to stop President Trump's executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked presidential powers to begin his long-promised immigration crackdown shortly after taking office on Monday. His executive actions included an order directing the federal government to stop issuing passports, citizenship certificates and other documents to many children born in the U.S. whose mothers are in the country illegally, or for whom neither parent is a legal permanent resident.",
      "The lawsuit by the 18 states, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, claims Mr. Trump's initiative violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the federal government has long interpreted to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth. The cities of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., also joined the suit. The 14th Amendment says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"The great promise of our nation is that everyone born here is a citizen of the United States, able to achieve the American dream,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement to CBS News. \"This fundamental right to birthright citizenship, rooted in the 14th Amendment and born from the ashes of slavery, is a cornerstone of our nation's commitment to justice.\"",
      "The suit is seeking a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the executive order, and ultimately, to invalidate it. The states that joined the suit are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "\"The President's executive order attempting to rescind birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional and quite frankly, un-American,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"We are asking a court to immediately block this order from taking effect and ensure that the rights of American-born children impacted by this order remain in effect while litigation proceeds. The President has overstepped his authority by a mile with this order, and we will hold him accountable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump directed that his order should be enforced in 30 days. It was challenged soon after it was issued, when the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups filed separate lawsuits seeking to thwart it.",
      "Later Tuesday, a group of four more states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Washington and Oregon \u2014 filed a lawsuit of their own in Washington state targeting the executive order, bringing to at least four the number of suits challenging it.",
      "\"We need to discuss bipartisan commonsense immigration reforms, but denying birthright citizenship, which dates back centuries and has been upheld twice by the U.S. Supreme Court, is not the solution,\" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.",

      "Washington \u2014 The former sister-in-law of Pete Hegseth, President Trump's nominee to become secretary of defense, told senators in a sworn affidavit that he caused his second wife to fear for her personal safety and abused alcohol over the course of many years.",
      "In the affidavit to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that was obtained by CBS News, Danielle Hegseth said she was married to Pete Hegseth's brother from 2011 to 2019. She recounted what she had told FBI agents who conducted a background check into Hegseth as part of the nomination process. She wrote that her statement came in response to a letter from Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "NBC News first reported on the document. Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, denied the allegations, calling Danielle Hegseth an \"anti-Trump far left Democrat.\"",
      "In the affidavit, she wrote that Samantha Hegseth, Pete Hegseth's second and now ex-wife, had told her that she once hid in the closet from Hegseth for fear of her safety, an incident she said occurred between the years of 2014 and 2016. She noted the anecdote was consistent with what she observed of Hegseth's behavior over a number of years.",
      "Hegseth's former sister-in-law also alleged that his ex-wife had a plan that she would use if she needed to get away from her husband. The plan involved Samantha Hegseth texting a safe word to Danielle Hegseth, who would then call a friend who could help her. Danielle Hegseth wrote that she received a text with the safe word and called the friend once between 2015 and 2016. Pete and Samantha Hegseth were married from 2010 to 2018.",
      "Danielle Hegseth acknowledged that she did not personally witness abuse and noted that what she knows of the situation she heard from Hegseth's ex-wife.",
      "At his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0last week, Hegseth was asked by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine: \"Did you ever engage in any acts of physical violence against any of your wives?\" He replied: \"Senator, absolutely not.\"",
      "Danielle Hegseth also claimed that he had drunkenly yelled at her and had to be pulled away during a 2009 incident, and that she personally witnessed Hegseth abusing alcohol on multiple occasions. She said Hegseth would drink to the point of passing out at family events, described one evening where she said he was dragged out of a bar, and another where she said he passed out in a bar bathroom, among other incidents.",
      "The affidavit was signed Tuesday in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Hegseth's former sister-in-law noted in the affidavit that her statement repeats what she told the FBI.",
      "Danielle Hegseth said she was providing the response because she does not think her former brother-in-law is fit to serve as defense secretary. She encouraged the Senate to consider the affidavit in its vote on Hegseth's nomination, which advanced out of committee on Monday.",
      "Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations in a statement, saying that Hegseth's ex-wife \"has never alleged that there was any abuse.\" He said Samantha Hegseth signed court documents to that effect and reaffirmed that there was no abuse during her FBI interview.",
      "\"Belated claims by Danielle Dietrich, an anti-Trump far left Democrat who is divorced from Mr. Hegseth's brother and never got along with the Hegseth family, do nothing to change that,\" Parlatore said. \"After an acrimonious divorce, Ms. Dietrich has had an axe to grind against the entire Hegseth family. Ms. Dietrich admits that she saw nothing but is now falsely accusing Sam of lying to both the Court and to the FBI because of private, undocumented statements that she allegedly made 10 years ago.\"",
      "Samantha Hegseth could not immediately be reached for comment, but told NBC News in an email that \"I do not believe your information to be accurate\" and declined to speak about her marriage to Hegseth.",
      "Hegseth appeared before the Armed Services Committee for his\u00a0confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, where he fielded tough questions from Democrats over his views on women in the military and an allegation of sexual assault, which he also denied.",
      "Hegseth faced intense scrutiny over reports about his background, and for weeks was considered to have the steepest path to confirmation out of\u00a0 Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees. But Republican senators on the Armed Services Committee defended his nomination during the hearing, after which one key member, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, made her support for Hegseth's confirmation known.",

      "\"My concern is the message that it sends when people who are arrested for committing violence against police officers are not held to account,\" he said. And I worry about the morale of my officers. I worry about just how this impacts them, and I don't want them handling some protest or making some arrest in the future and scratching their head wondering, 'Well, I wonder what's going to happen with this case?'\"",
      "He said many officers have expressed anger about the pardons.",
      "\"They're upset, and I don't blame them,\" Manger said.",

      "Manger also said Biden's commutation of the life sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier \"sends a pretty poor message\" to the FBI and all law enforcement. Peltier was convicted in the 1975 killing of two FBI agents.",

The Colorado Supreme Court, in its decision, said that habeas corpus can't be cited to release animals from zoos and that the lower court's ruling\u00a0will hold.",
      "The justices ruled 6-0 with one justice not voting.",
      "\"We conclude that the district court correctly held that Colorado's habeas statute only applies to persons, and not to nonhuman animals, no matter how cognitively, psychologically, or socially sophisticated they may be,\" State Supreme Court Justice Maria Berkenkotter wrote in her ruling.",
      "The zoo called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" in a statement, saying \"while we're happy with this outcome, we are disappointed that it ever came to this.\"",
      "\"For the past 19 months, we've been subjected to their misrepresented attacks, and we've wasted valuable time and money responding to them in courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the zoo's statement continued.",
      "The Nonhuman Rights Project expressed disappointment and hinted at the possibility of an attempt to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying Tuesday's ruling \"perpetuates a clear injustice, stating that unless an individual is human they have no right to liberty.\"",

      "\"Future courts will reject this notion, as judges in the United States and around the world have already begun to do,\" the group's statement\u00a0continued. \"As with other social justice movements, early losses are expected as we challenge an entrenched status quo that has allowed Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou, and Jambo to be relegated to a lifetime of mental and physical suffering. We'll share further analysis of this opinion as well as our next steps in the coming days.\"",
      "The district court did note, however, that the elephants likely were exposed to poor conditions and inadequately sized enclosures, but said the Nonhuman Rights Project simply has no standing under the law cited in its lawsuit.",
      "\"The district court granted the Zoo's motion to dismiss,\" Berkenkotter wrote in her ruling. \"As required in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court accepted the allegations in NRP's Petition as true, including its assertion that elephants cannot function normally in captivity. Addressing NRP's argument that the common law has historically been used to extend the writ of habeas corpus, the court noted that no U.S. court has extended the right to nonhuman animals and, regardless, that the right to habeas corpus in Colorado is a creature of statute.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday dramatically broadened the scope of expedited deportations, enacting a nationwide expansion of an immigration policy known as \"expedited removal\" that was previously limited to areas close to U.S. borders.",
      "Expedited removal allows U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants who lack proper documents through a streamlined process that bypasses the lengthy and massively backlogged immigration court system. If those identified for expedited removal do not request asylum or fail to establish they may have a legitimate asylum case, they can be expeditiously deported, without an opportunity to see an immigration judge.",
      "Before Tuesday's change, federal immigration officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Now, these expedited deportations will apply to unauthorized immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who can't prove they have been in the country for more than two years. The move by the Department of Homeland Security revived a first Trump administration policy that the Biden administration had discontinued. It took effect at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.",
      "In less than 48 hours since returning to the Oval Office, President Trump has already taken a flurry of actions, some of them unprecedented in nature, to launch a multi-faced crackdown on immigration.",
      "Mr. Trump shut down access to the U.S. asylum system using extraordinary presidential powers; declared a national emergency to dispatch more troops to the southern border; froze the refugee admissions programs; and directed federal agencies to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or on temporary visas. The latter action has already triggered lawsuits from Democratic-led states and pro-immigrant groups.",
      "The president has also laid the foundations for his promised mass deportations, directing federal officials to expand immigration detention facilities and allow local law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants. His administration rescinded Biden-era guidelines that barred deportation officers from making arrests at so-called \"sensitive locations,\" which include schools and churches.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0declaring that it's policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female,\" reversing the ability of Americans to mark \"other\" or \"X\" on federal forms and causing sweeping implications in the way the federal government acknowledges gender.",
      "Mr. Trump has long pledged to alter the way the federal government handles the issue of gender identification, and on the campaign trail, his lines about preventing transgender athletes from participating in women's sports prompted some of the loudest reactions from his rally-goers.",
      "LGBTQ rights groups are pledging to challenge Trump's order where they can.",
      "\"Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers,\" Mr. Trump's executive order reads. \"This is wrong.\"",
      "The order is at odds with the statements of transgender Americans, who say they are trying to use spaces that align with their gender identity, not \"gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.\"",
      "The president's executive order means the secretaries of the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management will require that government-issued identification documents, including visas, passports, and Global Entry cards, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\" Americans have been able to select \"X\" on their passports\u00a0since April 2022\u00a0under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The gender executive order also says the federal government is not to use terms like gender identity, instead using the sex assigned at birth.",
      "\"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology,\" the order reads. \"Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\"",
      "According to the LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD, \"gender ideology is not a term transgender people use to describe themselves, it is an inaccurate term deployed by opponents to undermine and dehumanize transgender and nonbinary people.\"",
      "The order also says the attorney general \"shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\"",
      "Legally speaking, Thomas Berry, director at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said the executive order is wide-ranging, but aspects of it may run up against a 2020 Supreme Court decision. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 vote that it is\u00a0illegal for an employer to fire someone because they are gay or transgender.",
      "\"It's such wide-ranging executive order,\" Berry said of Mr. Trump's action. \"I think some he has the authority to do and some parts of it are going to be more controversial. So one thing that strikes me immediately that I'm curious about is to what extent is he going to try to push back against the Supreme Court's Bostock decision from within the last five years, where the Supreme Court explicitly held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to both sexual orientation as well as gender identity, and discrimination on the basis of gender identity. So that's \u2014 that's a statute, the interpretation of which is up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has made a binding decision.\"",
      "Berry said the federal government will likely have more latitude in how it applies the order internally within the federal government, such as how federal employees may identify.",
      "Supporters of LGBTQ   rights have vowed to fight the Trump administration's changes however they can.",
      "Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said the ACLU is closely studying the impact and implementation of the order. Strangio said Tuesday that it's not yet clear whether changes will be retroactive with, for instance, State-Department-issued passports.",
      "\"I would anticipate a lot of future legal actions, but all of that will depend on what we actually see from the various agencies charged with implementing the various pieces of this executive order,\" Strangio said.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel with Lambda Legal that focuses on LGBT civil rights issues, also mentioned the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock as potentially counter to this order.",
      "\"We stand ready to challenge any of these implementation actions,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, some conservatives are pleased by the order.",
      "\"Trump has thrown down the gauntlet and made clear that his administration will protect women and girls and fight the gender ideologues who have enjoyed free reign for the past four years,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Jay Richards, who directs the Heritage Foundation's Center for Life, Religion, and Family. \"Of course, what can be done by executive order can be undone in the same way,\" Richards said, adding he hopes Congress will codify the definitions of male and female.",
      "The \"two sexes\" executive order is one of\u00a0more than 200 of executive actions\u00a0Mr. Trump took in his first day in office, ranging from attempting to end birthright citizenship to pardoning Jan. 6 rioters.",

    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",

      "Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican committee chair, set the tone by sharply criticizing the U.N. at the start of the hearing, saying that Stefanik \"can bring much-needed change\" to the institution.",
      "\"At this point, the U.S. should seriously examine if further contributions and, indeed, participation in the U.N. is even beneficial to the American people,\" the Idaho lawmaker said.",
      "Harvard-educated and the fourth-ranking member of the U.S. House, Stefanik was elected to Congress in 2015 as a moderate Republican and is leaving a decade later as one of Trump's most ardent allies. She embraced Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as he denied he lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "When Trump announced Stefanik's appointment, his former national security adviser John Bolton told The Associated Press that he sees her as the new version of Trump's U.N. ambassador in his first administration \u2014 Nikki Haley. Haley went on to challenge him, unsuccessfully, for the GOP nomination last year.",
      "Stefanik \"wants to run for president in 2028,\" said Bolton, who also served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in President George W. Bush's administration. \"She realizes she has no foreign policy experience, so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador. She stays two years, and then away we go.\"",
      "Stefanik was asked about her views on the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere as well as the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs \u2014 all issues on the U.N. agenda.",
      "The United States pays about one-fifth of the U.N.'s regular budget, and she has already been questioned about her comments on cutting the U.N. budget and continuing support for its multiple agencies. Those tackle everything from health, education and migration to reproductive rights and nuclear proliferation.",
      "She responded by saying she is open to reviewing agencies to ensure \"that all of our taxpayer dollars are going to entities that function very well.\"",
      "But she also agreed with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons about supporting efforts to strengthen alliances, especially when it comes to China's influence at the world body. Trump has been skeptical of U.S. alliances, including NATO and defense partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, which the Biden team worked to shore up after taking over from Trump after his first term.",
      "Stefanik saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning last year of a trio of university presidents about antisemitism on their campuses, leading to two of their resignations \u2014 a performance Trump repeatedly praised.",
      "\"I was interested in this position because if you look at the antisemitic rot within the United Nations, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" Stefanik testified.",
      "Who is Elise Stefanik?",
      "Stefanik, 40, would be the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to the U.N. The New York Republican has served in a leadership position as Republican conference chair, and she was on the House Armed Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. And that skillset honed in Congress will serve her well, said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Alterman said Stefanik brings some of the most important qualities a U.N. ambassador can have \u2014 a close relationship with the president and an ability to communicate and execute his policies.",
      "Elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014, Stefanik was the youngest Republican woman to join Congress at the age of 30. She has easily won reelection in her upstate New York district ever since. As GOP conference chair, Stefanik has been the highest-ranking woman in the House.",
      "Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik was the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree, according to her office. She graduated from Harvard University, where she studied government.",
      "She has been very vocal about supporting Israel, especially since the Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage. It led to the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where a ceasefire that the U.S. helped broker has taken hold.",
      "In her 20s, she worked in the White House on President George W. Bush's Domestic Policy Council. Stefanik and her husband have one son.",
      "\"The most important part of being a representative is having a relationship to the president, being able to speak for the president, and speak for the administration's policies,\" Alterman said. \"I think she is very good at thinking about messaging, she understands the president's instincts and he likes her.\"",
      "\"And I think the political skill that you pick up being in Congress ends up being really helpful when you're working in the U.N.,\" Alterman continued. \"I mean, a lot of it is about building coalitions, about neutralizing opposition, about finding compromises. All those kinds of things are skills that Congress and other kinds of political experience is great for.\"",
      "Alterman said he thinks people \"underestimate her communication skills.\"",
      "\"I think she's very smart and savvy,\" Alterman said. \"And having an ambassador to the UN who can understand the impact of her words and actions advances the administration's agenda.\""

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "story": [
      "In its first 24 hours in office, the Trump administration removed U.S. Secret Service protection from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who became a critic of the president after Bolton's ouster from the first Trump administration in 2019. Multiple sources told CBS News the decision was made in the past 24 hours.",
      "Bolton, an outspoken critic of President Trump, was granted Secret Service protection by the Biden administration in December 2021 for the first time since he served in the Trump White House. That decision followed a series of threats from Iran linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure, resulting in the assassination Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "In a statement, Bolton told CBS News that he is \"disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has made this decision.\"",
      "\"Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to once again extend Secret Service protection to me in 2021,\" Bolton continued.",
      "In 2022, Shahram Porsafi, a member of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was charged with a murder plot targeting Bolton. The Justice Department said in 2022 that the plot was \"likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani.\" The FBI offered a $300,000 reward for information leading to Porsafi's capture. Last September, the Biden administration announced a reward of up to $20 million for information on Porsafi.",
      "In his statement today, Bolton added, \"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination. The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"",
      "Bolton and another former national security adviser under Mr. Trump, Robert O'Brien, required ongoing U.S. Secret Service protection long after they left their positions, both due to potential threats from Iran. For nearly one year of protection, the total for both individuals was $12,280,324, a bill paid by U.S. taxpayers, according to reports filed to Congress by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and obtained by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last year through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "As is standard for all Secret Service protectees, Bolton had dedicated special agents keeping him safe\u00a0 24 hours a day, covering his home, as well as both domestic and foreign travel.",
      "The Secret Service declined a request for comment.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump took executive action to start revoking the security clearances of Bolton and dozens of intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The executive action was part of a slew of measures signed by Mr. Trump in the hours after he was sworn into a second term in office and is one of his first steps he has taken to target those he considers political opponents, now that he has returned to the White House.",
      "Among other first-day actions in the Trump administration, a newly hung portrait of former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley was removed from a wall at the Pentagon. Milley had reportedly previously criticized Mr. Trump as \"fascist\" and a \"wannabe dictator.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 In President Trump's speech after he was sworn into office for a second term Monday, he outlined a number of policies that would change the U.S.' relationship with the rest of the world. In addition to immediately clamping down on immigration across the southern border, Mr. Trump signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "While some international leaders congratulated Mr. Trump, others were unhappy with his first actions as president. Below is a look at reactions from around the world to Mr. Trump's initial moves.",
      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",
      "Speaking Monday, Mr. Trump accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, saying the agency had failed to act free of \"inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\" and had required \"unfairly onerous payments\" from the U.S., disproportionate to what some other, larger countries, such as China, were paying.",
      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,\" Tedros said. \"We hope the United States will reconsider and we look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue to maintain the partnership between the USA and WHO, for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump saying U.S. will pull out of Paris Climate Accords",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 a move that will take a year to complete and that he initiated during his first term, too \u2014 U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015. Its goal is to prevent \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\" and try \"to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\"",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nationwide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation,\" Stiell said, according to Reuters, adding that there was still room for the new Trump administration to change course.",
      "\"The door remains open to the Paris agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,\" Stiell said.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing European Commission, said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Europe would \"stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\"",
      "She vowed that the the 27-nation EU bloc would adhere to the terms and goals of the Paris agreement, which she said \"continues to be the best hope for all humanity.\"",
      "\"Unusual fear\" in Europe",
      "Georgios Samaras, a lecturer in public policy at King's College London, said European leaders would need to decide how to position themselves in regard to Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "\"I've spoken to colleagues in the European Union, and there is unusual fear right now in the commission, because they don't know what's next,\" Samaras told CBS News. \"I believe that Trump is going to choose his allies very carefully, and those who don't bend the knee will face the consequences of Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"The EU will either find a way to communicate with Trump or, similarly, they might be targeted,\" he predicted.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened the EU with tariffs, but Von der Leyen sent him her \"best wishes.\"",
      "\"The EU looks forward to working closely with you to tackle global challenges,\" the EU leader said in a social media post. \"Together, our societies can achieve greater prosperity and strengthen their common security. This is the enduring strength of the transatlantic partnership.\"",
      "Reaction from other global voices to Trump's inauguration",
      "The initial reactions from many world leaders were congratulatory, despite simmering tension between Mr. Trump and some longstanding U.S. allies.",
      "\"For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been repeatedly attacked in recent weeks by Trump appointee Elon Musk on social media, said. \"With President Trump's longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.\"",
      "In his final days in office, former President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsored terrorism. Mr. Trump immediately reversed that move, which Cuba's president Miquel Diaz-Canal called, \"an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.\"",
      "Mr. Trump again threatened in his inaugural address to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded shortly after his speech, reiterating in a statement that \"the Canal is and will continue being Panamanian, and its administration will continue being under Panama's control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\"",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Mr. Trump's executive orders paving the way for U.S. troops to be sent to the southern border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum said that the orders were similar to policies under Mr. Trump's previous administrations and that Mexico was, therefore, prepared.",
      "\"They can act in their territories within the framework of their constitution. What we say is: Stay away from our sovereignty, from our independence. We can coordinate, but we are a free, independent and sovereign country and we are going to seek coordination,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "She also criticized Mr. Trump's order to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "\"For us and for the whole world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not immediately impose new tariffs on China, as he'd indicated he might, and he recently delayed a ban on Chinese-owned TikTok that was conceived under his previous administration and passed under Biden's administration.",
      "\"China stands ready to work with the new U.S. government under the strategic guidance of the two presidents,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Guo said Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. \"Economic ties between China and the US are essentially mutually beneficial despite differences and disputes. China believes there is space for cooperation and dialogue in this trade area and both countries can engage in more talks.\"",
      "In a video statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that \"the best days of our alliance are yet to come.\"",
      "\"Your first term as President was filled with groundbreaking moments,\" Netanyahu said. \"I'm confident that we will complete the defeat of Iran's terror axis and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for our region.\"",
      "In Iran, the semi-official student news agency cited the country's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Kazem Gharibabadi as saying Tehran, as in the past, was ready to engage in direct negotiations with the new U.S. administration with the aim of getting sanctions lifted.",
      "\"If there will be also the same intention on the other side, the talks will take place and can reach a conclusion,\" Gharibabadi said.",
      "On the streets of Tehran, Iranians who spoke with CBS News voiced apprehension, given Mr. Trump's previous hard line on policy regarding their country and the devastating impact of the sanctions already in place.",

      "James Pavatt, Andrew's lover, also is on death row after he was convicted of killing Andrew with a shotgun in the family garage in Oklahoma City.",
      "In an unsigned opinion, the justices ordered the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to re-examine Andrew's prosecution to determine if judges \"reviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial court's mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so 'unduly prejudicial' as to render her trial 'fundamentally unfair.'\"",
      "Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice\u00a0Neil Gorsuch, wrote that the state produced overwhelming evidence that Andrew participated in her husband's murder and would have left the conviction and death sentencing in place.

      "The executive action was part of a slew of measures signed by Mr. Trump in the hours after he was sworn into a second term in office and is one of his first steps he has taken to target those he considers political opponents now that he has returned to the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his order that the signers of the letter \"willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.\"",
      "\"This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country,\" the order states. \"And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the nation has been imperiled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden, was stolen. He continued to push his accusations about the last election as recently as Monday, when he told supporters after his inauguration that the 2020 contest was \"totally rigged.\"",
      "The letter at issue was signed by 51 former intelligence officials and released in October 2020 after the New York Post reported on emails recovered from a laptop computer discovered at a Delaware repair shop. The owner of the shop said the laptop was left by Hunter Biden, the former president's son, in 2019.",
      "\"[T]he arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden's son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\" the officials wrote in their letter.",
      "They said that they did not know if the emails are \"genuine or not\" and did not have evidence that Russia was involved, but added that their \"experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.\"",
      "Among those who signed the letter \u2014 and are named in Mr. Trump's order \u2014 are former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden and former CIA Director John Brennan. Two of the 51 signatories have since died.",
      "The president accused the officials of coordinating with the Biden campaign to issue the letter. His order instructs the director of national intelligence, in consultation with the head of the CIA, to pull their security clearances, if they are still active.",
      "The order targets Bolton, who served for more than a year as Mr. Trump's national security adviser during his first term and wrote a book about his time in the role.",
      "The president accused Bolton of publishing sensitive information and said the book's publication \"created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in South Florida blocked the Justice Department from giving lawmakers the portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's report that deals with his investigation into President Trump's handling of classified documents.",
      "In a scathing rebuke of the Justice Department's proposal, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in a 14-page order\u00a0she is granting a request from Mr. Trump's co-defendants to keep the report from the heads of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Walt Nauta, an aide to Mr. Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, asked Cannon to block its release earlier this month.",
      "\"Never before has the Department of Justice, prior to the conclusion of criminal proceedings against a defendant \u2014 and absent a litigation-specific reason as appropriate in the case itself \u2014 sought to disclose outside the Department a report prepared by a Special Counsel containing substantive and voluminous case information. Until now,\" she wrote on Tuesday.",
      "Smith, who resigned as special counsel earlier this month, submitted to former Attorney General Merrick Garland a two-volume report on his investigations involving Mr. Trump. The first volume, related to his investigation into the president's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was released to the public days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "But Garland said the second volume, about the classified documents case, would not be available to the American people because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. Instead, the attorney general said the report would only be available to the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information about it.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira sought to completely shield the full report, arguing its disclosure would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Cannon last week cleared the way for the Justice Department to release the first volume, on the 2020 election case, but ordered a hearing on whether the second volume should be available to lawmakers.",
      "She also reviewed that part of the report herself, and said in her order that it contains \"detailed and voluminous discovery information\" covered by a protective order issued at an earlier stage in the case. Cannon wrote that Garland's proposal would risk prejudicing the ongoing case.",
      "\"The bare wishes of one attorney general with 'limited time' in office to comply with a non-existent 'historical practice' of releasing special counsel reports in the pendency of criminal proceedings is not a valid reason,\" she wrote. \"And surely it does not override the obvious constitutional interests of defendants in this action and this court's duty to protect the integrity of this proceeding.\"",
      "The judge, appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, rebuffed the Justice Department's assertions that there is interest by Congress in the unreleased portion of the report, noting there has been no subpoena for its release and no record of any lawmaker seeking to review it. There is also no pending legislation on the subject, she said.",
      "Cannon wrote that statements by prosecutors about Garland's desire to disclose the report to the four leaders of the Judiciary Committees \"do not reflect well on the department.\"",
      "\"[T]he Department offers no valid justification for the purportedly urgent desire to release to members of Congress case information in an ongoing criminal proceeding,\" she said.",
      "The judge also said that given the \"very strong public interest\" in the case involving Nauta and de Oliveira, there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that review by lawmakers would lead to the public dissemination of all or part of the report involving the classified documents investigation.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Smith\u00a0brought charges against Mr. Trump, alongside Nauta and de Oliveira, for allegedly holding onto classified documents after leaving office the first time in January 2021 and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation. The president and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "But last July, Cannon dismissed the indictment\u00a0on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed special counsel. The former special counsel appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected president last November, Smith asked the appeals court to drop the case against Mr. Trump, citing longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. The 11th Circuit agreed to do so, but the case is moving forward with Nauta and de Oliveira as co-defendants.",

      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",
      "Jenn Siebert, an Altadena mother of two, didn't need to hear that twice. \"I think he, well, he definitely saved my family's lives,\" she said. \"We all listened to him. We were like, 'This kid knows what he's talking about!'\"",
      "Her own house somehow survived; her neighbors weren't so lucky. \"My best friends, like, they've lost everything,\" Siebert said. \"They're alive, because, probably because of Edgar, I would imagine. Everybody in the Beautiful Altadena group is alive because of Edgar, right now.\"",
      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",
      "I asked Vaillant, \"Have we just pushed Nature too far?\"",
      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",
      "Going into Thursday's test flight, SpaceX said 2025 \"will be transformational for Starship with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",

      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "In a news release, SpaceX said that \"initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas.\"",
      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

      "It was so much better that the 8th grade lacrosse goalie made the radical choice to get a flip phone, giving him the ability to communicate without all the smart features \u2014 and distractions.",
      "A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 advisory on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating \"tech-free zones\" and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile, several states have taken steps to ban cellphones in schools.",
      "Swapping smartphones for flip phones",
      "Ben said he used to average up to five hours of screen time per day. Once he switched to a flip phone, it went down to about 30 minutes. So, CBS News asked four of Ben's friends, Carson, Ranita, Jamison and Maya \u2014 all 8th graders in New Jersey \u2014 to try flip phones for a week. Maya said her average screen time at the beginning of the week was more than 10 hours, spent mostly watching TV and on Tiktok.",
      "They were curious but skeptical about the experiment. Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion. They spent time gathered around the kitchen table with Ben teaching them how to use these foreign devices, including learning how to text without a \"modern\" keyboard.",

      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Washington \u2014 TikTok began restoring service to users in the United States following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to try to pause the ban by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",
      "STATEMENT FROM TIKTOK:In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170\u2026",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's China-bases parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "The app was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores.",
      "Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the president-elect had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and \"they agreed to work together on this.\"",
      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",

      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products.

      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Top technology company CEOs, whose companies have collectively donated millions to Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee, are expected to have a conspicuous presence at the ceremony. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is\u00a0scheduled to attend, sources told CBS News this week; the online retailer was among the companies that donated $1 million to the fund.",

      "Not surprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump has tapped along with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to explore ways to cut federal spending, will also appear at the inauguration, CBS News has confirmed. Musk said\u00a0on his social media platform, X, this week that he felt \"honored\" to sit alongside Bezos and \u00a0Zuckerberg on the inauguration dais, where Cabinet members, nominees and elected officials are placed.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "summary": "Honolulu Police say modern forensic tests allowed them to identify and arrest a suspect in Dawn Momohara's 1977 murder.",
    "story": [
      "Police have arrested a suspect in the unsolved murder of a Honolulu teenager, whose death rocked the high school where her body was discovered almost five decades ago. They said the man arrested, Gideon Castro, was one of her former schoolmates who joined the U.S. Army Reserve after graduating.",
      "Dawn Momohara was found dead the morning of March 21, 1977, on the second floor of a building at McKinley High School, in Hawaii's capital, according to the Honolulu Police Department. She was 16 and a student there in her sophomore year.",
      "Officers at the time showed up to a gruesome scene. Momohara was partially clothed and lying on her back with an orange cloth tied around her neck, said Lt. Deena Thoemmes, of Honolulu Police, at a Tuesday news conference. A subsequent autopsy ruled Momohara was strangled to death, and the medical examiner said there were signs of sexual assault.",
      "Although police retrieved an unknown man's DNA sample from the teenager's clothing, they could not identify a suspect. Authorities would not develop meaningful leads in the homicide until 2020, after a cold case detective re-submitted evidence for forensic exams using updated technology.",
      "By September 2023, the DNA tests led investigators to two possible suspects: brothers Gideon Castro and William Castro, who had both been interviewed in the immediate aftermath of Momohara's killing. Back then, Gideon Castro told police he met Momohara at a school dance in 1976, just before he graduated, police said. William Castro in those interviews said he and Momohara periodically talked on the phone but denied ever being in any kind of relationship with her.",
      "Once forensic tests narrowed down the pool of potential suspects to the Castro brothers, Thoemmes said police traveled to Chicago, where William Castro lived, to obtain a DNA sample secretly from one of his children and use it as a comparison. The comparison excluded William Castro as a suspect, and Gideon Castro, now 66, was arrested at his nursing home in Utah on a second-degree murder charge.",
      "Gideon Castro will be extradited back to Honolulu, Thoemmes said.",
      "\"On behalf of the Honolulu Police Department, I want to thank all the individuals and agencies that made today's arrest possible,\" the lieutenant said. \"Thank you for all your dedication and commitment to the tireless purusit of justice for Dawn and the Momohara family.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:02:34 -0500",
    "summary": "A California couple is suing for $1 million in damages, citing property damage and emotional distress.",
    "story": [
      "A California couple is suing JetBlue for $1 million, alleging that a large chunk of ice from one of the airline's planes crashed through the ceiling right over their bed.",
      "According to court documents reviewed by CBS News, Michael Reese and Leah Ferrarini were sleeping in bed on Jan. 1, 2024 when a \"large block of ice\" came through the roof. The lawsuit claims the chunk of ice was \"the size of a watermelon\" and the couple \"barely (escaped) devastating physical injury.\" Police and the fire department were called to the home.",
      "An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration found the plane had a history of potable water issues, going back to July 2023, the lawsuit said, and the same aircraft was suspected to have dropped ice on a Massachusetts home in August 2023.",
      "The suit alleges that JetBlue failed to \"investigate and correct the problems\" causing the water issues and falling ice blocks. On January 11, 2024, 10 days after the ice fell on the plaintiff's home, the plane was flagged so its potable water system valve and drain could be removed and inspected, the lawsuit said. The plane was removed from service in February 2024 for repairs, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"JetBlue had been on notice for months prior to January 1, 2024, yet failed to conduct an investigation as to the problems with the potable water system valve and drain,\" the lawsuit said. \"Had JetBlue done so after being on notice that there was a problem as early as July 2023, the discharge of the large block of ice on Plaintiffs' home would not have occurred.\"",
      "JetBlue said they could not comment on the lawsuit because of ongoing litigation, but said that at the company, \"safety is our number one priority and guides everything we do.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, the chunk of ice caused \"extensive damage\" to the roof, and the couple have \"suffered severe emotional distress\" which they said resulted in insomnia that has led Reese, a commercial driver, to turn down work. The pair said they have also both attended therapy because of the incident. Both plaintiffs have become \"anxious and depressed\" and have a constant fear that their home may be struck again, the lawsuit said. Planes pass over the home every five minutes, the lawsuit said, and they now \"cringe in fear with each plane\" that flies overhead. The pair are considering moving, even though they consider their current residence \"their dream home.\"",
      "The couple is suing JetBlue for negligence, according to the lawsuit, and for trespassing.",
      "\"JetBlue knew or should have known that there had been (a) prior instance of ice falling from the aircraft at issue ... and that a thorough inspection and investigation of the potable water servicing system would have discovered a defect in the valve which was causing a leak and the ice dropping from the aircraft at issue,\" the lawsuit stated.",
      "The couple are asking for a jury trial on the charges. Ferrarini and Reese are asking for $360,000 for property damages, $40,000 in medical expenses, $300,000 for emotional distress, and $300,000 for pain, suffering and inconvenience, according to court documents.",
      "An attorney representing Reese and Ferrarini did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Last June, a New Jersey family told CBS New York that a huge chunk of ice apparently fell from an airplane above, crashing through their roof and landing just feet from where they were sitting.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune filed cloture on John Ratcliffe's nomination for CIA director, Kristi Noem's nomination for Homeland Security Secretary and Pete Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary on Tuesday. But Democrats forced procedural maneuvers to stall the nominations' consideration, prompting a tense scene on the Senate floor late Tuesday.",
      "\"Now we're not going to have a vote today, and apparently we're not going to have a vote tomorrow,\" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said after Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy objected to a time agreement that would have allowed the Senate to vote on Ratcliffe's nomination Tuesday night. \"Which means I hope nobody's making any plans for the weekend.\"",
      "Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said there are \"serious concerns\" about Ratcliffe's ability to distance himself from Mr. Trump's political interests during his first term, urging that it's not too much to ask for senators to have time to debate the nomination on the floor.",
      "\"If he's got the votes, he can be on the job this weekend,\" Murphy added.",
      "Cotton, the new chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he didn't understand the objection to Ratcliffe's nomination, noting that he was previously confirmed by the Senate as the director of national intelligence and was voted out of committee on a 14-3 vote earlier this week. He added that the Senate would get Ratcliffe, Hegseth and Noem confirmed \"the easy way or the hard way,\" saying the GOP tried to cooperate with the Democrats, but the cooperation \"has not been forthcoming.\"",
      "\"What this is really about is trying to drag out all of these nominations to play procedural games,\" Cotton said, adding that Democrats are doing so to try to \"deny President Trump his Cabinet in a prompt and timely fashion.\"",
      "If Democrats don't agree to speed up the process, the confirmations could run through the weekend.",
      "The standoff comes after the Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in. On Tuesday, the president met with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson as the Republicans face pressure to get Mr. Trump's team in place and begin working on passing his agenda.",
      "Thune backed Cotton up Tuesday night, reiterating that \"this can be easy or this can be hard.\"",
      "\"This is about America's national security interest, and we're stalling,\" Thune said. \"So that's not going to happen.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has pledged that Democrats won't \"reflexively oppose\" Mr. Trump's nominees, citing Rubio's speedy confirmation. But the New York Democrat warned Tuesday that \"too many of the president's nominees do not match Sen. Rubio's caliber.\"",
      "\"Too many have troubling backgrounds, too many seem unprepared for the job and proved so during testimony,\" Schumer added, saying \"it's wrong to try and rush them through.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",
      "Mr. Trump's order targeting prices highlights several areas for federal departments to focus on, including reducing the number of federal regulations that Trump administration officials argue has driven up the cost of living for American families.",
      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",

      "A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday to stop President Trump's executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked presidential powers to begin his long-promised immigration crackdown shortly after taking office on Monday. His executive actions included an order directing the federal government to stop issuing passports, citizenship certificates and other documents to many children born in the U.S. whose mothers are in the country illegally, or for whom neither parent is a legal permanent resident.",
      "The lawsuit by the 18 states, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, claims Mr. Trump's initiative violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the federal government has long interpreted to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth. The cities of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., also joined the suit. The 14th Amendment says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"The great promise of our nation is that everyone born here is a citizen of the United States, able to achieve the American dream,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement to CBS News. \"This fundamental right to birthright citizenship, rooted in the 14th Amendment and born from the ashes of slavery, is a cornerstone of our nation's commitment to justice.\"",
      "The suit is seeking a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the executive order, and ultimately, to invalidate it. The states that joined the suit are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "\"The President's executive order attempting to rescind birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional and quite frankly, un-American,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"We are asking a court to immediately block this order from taking effect and ensure that the rights of American-born children impacted by this order remain in effect while litigation proceeds. The President has overstepped his authority by a mile with this order, and we will hold him accountable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump directed that his order should be enforced in 30 days. It was challenged soon after it was issued, when the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups filed separate lawsuits seeking to thwart it.",
      "Later Tuesday, a group of four more states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Washington and Oregon \u2014 filed a lawsuit of their own in Washington state targeting the executive order, bringing to at least four the number of suits challenging it.",

      "In the affidavit to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that was obtained by CBS News, Danielle Hegseth said she was married to Pete Hegseth's brother from 2011 to 2019. She recounted what she had told FBI agents who conducted a background check into Hegseth as part of the nomination process. She wrote that her statement came in response to a letter from Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "NBC News first reported on the document. Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, denied the allegations, calling Danielle Hegseth an \"anti-Trump far left Democrat.\"",
      "In the affidavit, she wrote that Samantha Hegseth, Pete Hegseth's second and now ex-wife, had told her that she once hid in the closet from Hegseth for fear of her safety, an incident she said occurred between the years of 2014 and 2016. She noted the anecdote was consistent with what she observed of Hegseth's behavior over a number of years.",
      "Hegseth's former sister-in-law also alleged that his ex-wife had a plan that she would use if she needed to get away from her husband. The plan involved Samantha Hegseth texting a safe word to Danielle Hegseth, who would then call a friend who could help her. Danielle Hegseth wrote that she received a text with the safe word and called the friend once between 2015 and 2016. Pete and Samantha Hegseth were married from 2010 to 2018.",
      "Danielle Hegseth acknowledged that she did not personally witness abuse and noted that what she knows of the situation she heard from Hegseth's ex-wife.",
      "At his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0last week, Hegseth was asked by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine: \"Did you ever engage in any acts of physical violence against any of your wives?\" He replied: \"Senator, absolutely not.\"",
      "Danielle Hegseth also claimed that he had drunkenly yelled at her and had to be pulled away during a 2009 incident, and that she personally witnessed Hegseth abusing alcohol on multiple occasions. She said Hegseth would drink to the point of passing out at family events, described one evening where she said he was dragged out of a bar, and another where she said he passed out in a bar bathroom, among other incidents.",
      "The affidavit was signed Tuesday in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Hegseth's former sister-in-law noted in the affidavit that her statement repeats what she told the FBI.",
      "Danielle Hegseth said she was providing the response because she does not think her former brother-in-law is fit to serve as defense secretary. She encouraged the Senate to consider the affidavit in its vote on Hegseth's nomination, which advanced out of committee on Monday.",
      "Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations in a statement, saying that Hegseth's ex-wife \"has never alleged that there was any abuse.\" He said Samantha Hegseth signed court documents to that effect and reaffirmed that there was no abuse during her FBI interview.",
      "\"Belated claims by Danielle Dietrich, an anti-Trump far left Democrat who is divorced from Mr. Hegseth's brother and never got along with the Hegseth family, do nothing to change that,\" Parlatore said. \"After an acrimonious divorce, Ms. Dietrich has had an axe to grind against the entire Hegseth family. Ms. Dietrich admits that she saw nothing but is now falsely accusing Sam of lying to both the Court and to the FBI because of private, undocumented statements that she allegedly made 10 years ago.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday dramatically broadened the scope of expedited deportations, enacting a nationwide expansion of an immigration policy known as \"expedited removal\" that was previously limited to areas close to U.S. borders.",
      "Expedited removal allows U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants who lack proper documents through a streamlined process that bypasses the lengthy and massively backlogged immigration court system. If those identified for expedited removal do not request asylum or fail to establish they may have a legitimate asylum case, they can be expeditiously deported, without an opportunity to see an immigration judge.",
      "Before Tuesday's change, federal immigration officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Now, these expedited deportations will apply to unauthorized immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who can't prove they have been in the country for more than two years. The move by the Department of Homeland Security revived a first Trump administration policy that the Biden administration had discontinued. It took effect at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.",

      "Mr. Trump has long pledged to alter the way the federal government handles the issue of gender identification, and on the campaign trail, his lines about preventing transgender athletes from participating in women's sports prompted some of the loudest reactions from his rally-goers.",

      "The order is at odds with the statements of transgender Americans, who say they are trying to use spaces that align with their gender identity, not \"gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.\"",
      "The president's executive order means the secretaries of the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management will require that government-issued identification documents, including visas, passports, and Global Entry cards, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\" Americans have been able to select \"X\" on their passports\u00a0since April 2022\u00a0under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The gender executive order also says the federal government is not to use terms like gender identity, instead using the sex assigned at birth.",

      "Legally speaking, Thomas Berry, director at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said the executive order is wide-ranging, but aspects of it may run up against a 2020 Supreme Court decision. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 vote that it is\u00a0illegal for an employer to fire someone because they are gay or transgender.",
      "\"It's such wide-ranging executive order,\" Berry said of Mr. Trump's action. \"I think some he has the authority to do and some parts of it are going to be more controversial. So one thing that strikes me immediately that I'm curious about is to what extent is he going to try to push back against the Supreme Court's Bostock decision from within the last five years, where the Supreme Court explicitly held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to both sexual orientation as well as gender identity, and discrimination on the basis of gender identity. So that's \u2014 that's a statute, the interpretation of which is up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has made a binding decision.\"",
      "Berry said the federal government will likely have more latitude in how it applies the order internally within the federal government, such as how federal employees may identify.",
      "Supporters of LGBTQ   rights have vowed to fight the Trump administration's changes however they can.",
      "Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said the ACLU is closely studying the impact and implementation of the order. Strangio said Tuesday that it's not yet clear whether changes will be retroactive with, for instance, State-Department-issued passports.",
      "\"I would anticipate a lot of future legal actions, but all of that will depend on what we actually see from the various agencies charged with implementing the various pieces of this executive order,\" Strangio said.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel with Lambda Legal that focuses on LGBT civil rights issues, also mentioned the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock as potentially counter to this order.",
      "\"We stand ready to challenge any of these implementation actions,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, some conservatives are pleased by the order.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration ousted Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, who is the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. military.",
    "story": [
      "Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan was ousted by the Trump administration Tuesday, on President Trump's first full day in office. In 2022, Fagan became the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. military.",
      "Fagan was relieved of her duties Monday night in a workforce-wide message by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamin Huffman.",
      "\"Under my statutory authority as the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security I have relieved Admiral Linda L. Fagan of her duties as Commandant of the United States Coast Guard,\" the brief message read, in part. \"She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation.\"",
      "The Coast Guard commandant is appointed for a four-year term, and Fagan had served two years.",
      "A senior DHS official said in a statement that Fagan was terminated \"because of her leadership deficiencies, operational failures, and inability to advance the strategic objectives of the U.S. Coast Guard.\"",
      "In particular, the official said she had failed to address border security threats, citing \"insufficient coordination\" with DHS on operations along maritime borders and \"ineffective deployment of Coast Guard assets\" to support efforts to interdict fentanyl and other illicit substances.",
      "The official also cited \"significant shortfalls\" in recruitment and mismanagement, including \"[i]nadequate accountability for acquisition failures highlighted during the Trump 45 Administration.\"",
      "During her time as head of the service, Fagan worked to bolster the recruitment and retention of personnel amid a slump in numbers across the U.S. armed forces. Last year,\u00a0as CBS News reported, the U.S. Coast Guard met its recruitment goals for its active-duty workforce, the reserves and officers for the first time since 2007.",
      "And Hagan was also criticized by the official for \"[e]xcessive focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies including at the US Coast Guard Academy, diverting resources and attention from operational imperatives.\"",
      "Fagan worked to rebuild trust within the halls of Congress and the agency's own ranks, following previous revelations that the\u00a0Coast Guard had mishandled sexual harassment and assault allegations. But the official said there had been a \"failure to adequately address the systemic issues\" and blamed Fagan for \"a leadership culture unwilling to ensure accountability and transparency in protecting service members.\"",
      "Adm. Kevin Lunday, the service's No. 2 in command, was named acting Coast Guard commandant, according to Huffman's note. Lunday became vice commandant last June.",
      "The Coast Guard, which sits under the Department of Homeland Security, has faced a budget crunch for several administrations. Several recent commandants, including Fagan, had urged lawmakers to fund the construction of new ships and repair of older ones to assist in the service's expanding global role in safeguarding national security. Last year, the Coast Guard officially welcomed its first polar icebreaker in more than 25 years.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who leads the new administration's effort to cut costs across the federal government, did not explicitly confirm the termination of Fagan but\u00a0wrote on X in response to the news\u00a0that \"undermining the U.S. military and border security to spend money on racist/sexist DEI nonsense is no longer acceptable.\"",
      "Fox News was the first to report the news of Fagan's ouster.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration revoked a Biden-era policy that prohibited ICE arrests at or near schools, places of worship and other \"sensitive locations.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Just hours after President Trump's inauguration, his administration revoked a Biden-era policy that prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents at or near schools, places of worship and other places deemed to be \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "Benjamine Huffman, whom the Trump administration installed as acting homeland security secretary pending the confirmation of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, issued a memo on Monday reversing the Biden administration's immigration arrest guidelines on \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "That policy, signed by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to refrain from apprehending unauthorized immigrants at or near locations \"that would restrain people's access to essential services or engagement in essential activities.\" Those locations included schools; places of worship; hospitals and other healthcare facilities; shelters; relief centers; and public demonstrations, like rallies and protests.",
      "In a statement defending the termination of the Biden administration rule, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration \"will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates had feared the rescission of the Biden-era rules, warning that it would allow the Trump administration to bring its mass deportations plans to churches and schools.",
      "But the Trump administration said Monday's decision was designed to target unauthorized immigrants with serious criminal histories.",
      "\"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens \u2014 including murders and rapists \u2014 who have illegally come into our country,\" DHS said in its statement. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest.\"",
      "Monday's action is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to eliminate limits other administrations have placed on ICE operations as it lays the groundwork for what the president has pledged will be the largest deportation operation in American history. The administration is expected to ramp up immigration arrests in cities and communities with \"sanctuary\" policies that restrict cooperation between local enforcement and ICE.",
      "The administration is also expected to rescind other Biden administration memos that discontinued mass immigration sweeps at worksites like factories and that limited ICE arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent border arrivals.",
      "Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" has repeatedly said the new administration, like every administration, will prioritize the arrest of immigrants who are in the country illegally and who have committed crimes. But he has stressed that no one will be exempt from immigration enforcement if they are in the U.S. illegally, warning that arrests of non-criminal unauthorized immigrants are likely.",
      "Mr. Trump moved swiftly on his first day back in the White House to launch his long-expected immigration crackdown, issuing a blitz of orders that sought to deny birthright citizenship to the children of unauthorized immigrants and temporary visas holders; suspend asylum and refugee admissions; and enlist the military's aid in border enforcement though an emergency declaration.",
      "Another executive order directed officials to expand detention sites to hold deportees and increase agreements with local law enforcement authorities, so they can arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants as deputized immigration officers.",

    "summary": "U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Donald W. Downing was assigned to the 557th Tactical Fighter Squadron during the Vietnam War.",
    "story": [
      "A United States pilot who disappeared while conducting a spy mission during the Vietnam War has finally been accounted for, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Donald W. Downing was assigned to the 557th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, 7th Air Force in September 1967, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Downing, 33, was piloting one of two aircraft in a nighttime armed reconnaissance mission over what was then known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Sept. 5, 1967.",
      "While the two planes were on a run to the target, the first saw a \"large, bright fireball in the air,\" according to the agency. Downing did not respond to radio calls to his F-4C Phantom II. And though search and rescue efforts started at daylight, electronic and visual searches of the area found nothing.",
      "More than a decade later, on April 28, 1978, Downing was reported as killed in action. He was later posthumously promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, the DPAA said. His name was recorded on the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. and the American Battle Monuments Commission's Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, along with the names of other unaccounted-for soldiers from the Vietnam War.",
      "The incident was investigated for decades, to little result, the DPAA said. Finally, in the spring of 2024, a recovery team found life support equipment, possible material evidence, aircraft wreckage, unexploded ordnance and possible osseous materials \u2014 bones \u2014 at a site in Quang Binh Province, Vietnam.",
      "The DPAA uses the intersection of \"history, diplomacy and science\" to make identifications, Ashley Wright, a public affairs specialist with the agency, told CBS News in 2024. Researchers and experts search archival records to learn about the circumstances where a fallen soldier was last seen, and investigative teams talk to surviving witnesses and examine the area for clues. Recovery teams, like the ones that found the evidence at Downings' crash site in 2024, are then sent to the area, Wright said.",
      "Then, once everything is back at the lab, multiple scientists combine their expertise to help make identifications. Forensic odontologists, a kind of dentist, can match evidence to dental records. Tests that reveal a deceased person's diet are used to determine what country a soldier was from \u2014 Americans are more likely to eat a corn-based diet, Wright said. Family members are asked for reference samples of DNA, which can help show a genetic match.",
      "The evidence from Downings' crash was brought to the DPAA laboratory in June 2024. The DPAA said its scientists used anthropological analysis, multiple forms of DNA analysis and material and circumstantial evidence to identify the remains as Downings'.",
      "His family received a full briefing on his identification, the DPAA said, though it did not specify which members that included. Downing was survived by his wife and four children, as well as his parents and four siblings, according to a news clipping published after his disappearance. The news clipping said that Downing had been reported missing in action just a few days before the couple's seventh wedding anniversary.",
      "A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Courts of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for. He will be honored with a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.",

    "story": [
      "In its first 24 hours in office, the Trump administration removed U.S. Secret Service protection from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who became a critic of the president after Bolton's ouster from the first Trump administration in 2019. Multiple sources told CBS News the decision was made in the past 24 hours.",
      "Bolton, an outspoken critic of President Trump, was granted Secret Service protection by the Biden administration in December 2021 for the first time since he served in the Trump White House. That decision followed a series of threats from Iran linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure, resulting in the assassination Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "In a statement, Bolton told CBS News that he is \"disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has made this decision.\"",
      "\"Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to once again extend Secret Service protection to me in 2021,\" Bolton continued.",
      "In 2022, Shahram Porsafi, a member of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was charged with a murder plot targeting Bolton. The Justice Department said in 2022 that the plot was \"likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani.\" The FBI offered a $300,000 reward for information leading to Porsafi's capture. Last September, the Biden administration announced a reward of up to $20 million for information on Porsafi.",
      "In his statement today, Bolton added, \"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination. The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"",
      "Bolton and another former national security adviser under Mr. Trump, Robert O'Brien, required ongoing U.S. Secret Service protection long after they left their positions, both due to potential threats from Iran. For nearly one year of protection, the total for both individuals was $12,280,324, a bill paid by U.S. taxpayers, according to reports filed to Congress by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and obtained by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last year through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "As is standard for all Secret Service protectees, Bolton had dedicated special agents keeping him safe\u00a0 24 hours a day, covering his home, as well as both domestic and foreign travel.",
      "The Secret Service declined a request for comment.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump took executive action to start revoking the security clearances of Bolton and dozens of intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The executive action was part of a slew of measures signed by Mr. Trump in the hours after he was sworn into a second term in office and is one of his first steps he has taken to target those he considers political opponents, now that he has returned to the White House.",
      "Among other first-day actions in the Trump administration, a newly hung portrait of former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley was removed from a wall at the Pentagon. Milley had reportedly previously criticized Mr. Trump as \"fascist\" and a \"wannabe dictator.\"",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe must \"wake up\" and spend more on its defense as Trump returns, but how realistic is the suggestion?",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump cemented his return to the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron told his European counterparts\u00a0this week to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce the continent's reliance on the United States for security.",
      "\"What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\" Macron said Monday, addressing members of the French military.",
      "President Trump has often criticized America's NATO allies for failing to meet domestic defense spending targets. At a February 2024 campaign rally in South Carolina, he said he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't meet the target.",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump repeated a demand he first made in January that NATO \"needs to pay 5%.\" Under a 2014 agreement made by the group, the alliance's more than 30 member states committed to aim to spend at least 2% of the value of their domestic economies on defense every year. During his first term in office, Mr. Trump pressured America's allies to meet that threshold, and some have increased their military spending since that time, but many still do not make the 2% bar.",
      "In his remarks just two days after the U.S. election in November, Macron called on Europeans \"to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy\" and to decrease reliance on U.S. military hardware and defense leadership.",
      "CBS News has spoken with analysts and former officials from several European countries and NATO following the U.S. election. The experts, from Poland, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and the NATO alliance itself, vary in their assessments of the feasibility of Macron's broad vision, but they largely agree that Europe can and should cooperate more closely and spend more money on defense.",
      "The direct quotes below have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Poland - Professor Katarzyna Pisarska",
      "Chair, Warsaw Security Forum",
      "Speaking on Macron's comments:",
      "You have to remember that Macron's vision is not really a detail-oriented, ready-to-go project. It is an idea that has been discussed in Europe, and throughout the last two years, but the general direction is that we are not building anything that would be competitive to NATO. Rather, we would be creating capabilities, especially defense capabilities, that would help and strengthen the European defense pillar of NATO.",
      "The idea that we would go alone without the United States has been rejected by almost all, if not all, EU and NATO member states.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "Poland currently buys 80% of all its military stocks from the United States. It's heavily dependent on American air missile defense systems. These are not things that you can detangle or unbundle from overnight. So the majority of countries \u2014 especially from the NATO eastern flank \u2014 will tell you we will absolutely not go alone without the United States. There is no way that France, and even less so Germany, can step up to deliver the type of technological capabilities that are needed to substitute for the Americans on the ground here in Europe.",
      "Discussion has moved in the direction that it has been moving pre-Trump election: Europe has to step up with NATO, start producing more, start spending more, also developing its own capabilities. We also need to have a number of different defense elements that we procure and create by ourselves, and that should be also understandable to our American partners, although when I spoke with congressmen in April, not all of them understood that it is okay for Europeans to spend money on European equipment and not only on American or Korean equipment.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "Maybe President Emmanuel Macron has some idea since [the U.S. election] that he can yet again push the idea that European strategic autonomy is really complete independent from the United States. But I will say it again: From countries that are on the forefront of this war [in Ukraine], for countries that will have to be the first battleground of this war, which is the NATO eastern flank, that is not negotiable.",
      "We will have to do more and we will be doing more. I think what is unclear in the United States is that Europe already delivers 50% of military aid to Ukraine and 90% of financial and refugee aid to Ukraine. So stepping up has already happened to a large extent.",
      "It has to happen more. We need to have more troops. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves, but having America as an ally, not a competitor, I think this is what is very important to understand.",
      "U.K. - Alistair Burt",
      "Former Member of U.K. Parliament and minister of state for the Middle East at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and minister of state at the Department for International Development",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "We have known for some time that the United States, under whatever leadership, would be asking Europeans to spend more on their defense, and what Trump's election has done has catalyzed that now. I think you have to take people at their word, and what Trump has said about NATO in the past and what people have said about European defense, rings true. I think he's [Macron] making the point that in the end, it's up to us. You're either a supplicant or you're making the weather. And there's no reason why we should just roll over and take the world as President Trump is going to try and define it. It will still, I'm absolutely certain, be in the interests of the West to act together, but we cannot take that for granted any longer, and I think Macron is right to seize upon it.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "I noticed that Macron's speech sort of offered the invitation to those outside the EU to be part of this wider European political community that the United Kingdom has made very clear it intends to be part of. I think the United Kingdom does have a role to play in this. Clearly our military is a very important part of NATO and will always be, but I would very much believe it is in the United Kingdom's interest to act with the wider European community. It bolsters them, strengthens them, and it's in our own interests. We at least have begun to spend more on defense. Other states will have more catching up to do but I do see it in the U.K.'s political and economic and military interests to be active in relation to what Macron has been saying.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "All the rhetoric has been absolutely right, we cannot afford to let Russia win. You have the Baltic states very anxious, you have [countries] with Russian enclaves that could allow Putin to say, there are Russian people here, so we will defend their interests just as we purported to do in Ukraine. How would [those countries] feel if there was some sense that Ukraine was not being supported?",
      "On the other hand, if you take out the United States' economic and military support that is asking a great deal of the rest of us to make up. I think the rhetoric is very, very clear, in that everybody has said we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and there can't be any weakening in that. The moment you've got any possibility of that weakening, then you're effectively giving the game away.",
      "If there is to be some sort of U.S.-brokered negotiation [for Ukraine], clearly [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy wants to be in the strongest possible position. And to do that, he's got to be able to enter those negotiations with the clear determination of the rest of Europe behind him to say whatever happens, we won't let you down, but if it goes on for two, four, five years, who knows?",
      "I don't think Europe can say anything other than what it's saying, and again, I think you have to take us at our word.",
      "NATO - Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff",
      "Former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "Let's nail this for once and for all: There is one effective military alliance in Europe - a political-military alliance in Europe, in the trans-Atlantic region \u2014 and it's called NATO. NATO has a command structure. It has a doctrine. It practices regularly. It is used to moving and commanding military forces at real scale. What is the point of trying to create something where we've got 70 years, 75 years of experience with NATO? Now, of course, the problem is, what happens if America, under Trump, either pulls out of NATO, which is unlikely, or reduces its support to NATO, which is possible?",
      "The solution to that, frankly, is not to start blathering on about new formations under the European Union. It's to lean into NATO and damn well start spending money. Why is Trump and why are America likely to pull a rug from under NATO, if they do? Because the French, the Germans, the British, the Spanish, the Italians, have simply not pulled their weight in defense spending terms for most of the 75 years of NATO's existence, or certainly, at least the last, certainly the last 30 years. So, lean into NATO and really double down on NATO and double down on defense spending.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "There is one good thing, though, that the European Union can do, which is defense industries. If they can get a grip of European defense procurement in order to offset the current dependence on the Americans in order to standardize weaponry. It is ridiculous for the British to continue with its own cottage industry of making tanks, when actually the rest of Europe buys Leopard IIs, which is a perfectly good tank, from Rheinmetall [in Germany].",
      "This is going to require some real political boldness, and it is going to require a pooling and a sharing of sovereignty. It's going to require individual nations like Britain to say, okay, we're not going to make a tank. We'll buy the Leopard II.",
      "On NATO:",
      "If you start building large numbers of European [non-NATO] headquarters, they've got to come from somewhere - a European command structure. What it means is that NATO will suffer. You know, I was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, one of many Brits that go back to Montgomery. The Germans have the Chief of Staff. The Chairman of the Military Committee is a Dutchman at the moment, and he or she rotates the commanders of the joint force commands. Europe has a leading role in NATO. Europeans have leading roles in NATO. But it all comes down to really leaning in and being able to produce the troop numbers, the ships, the planes, that NATO needs to really provide an effective deterrence.",
      "Germany - Norbert Roetgen",
      "Former Chair, Bundestag (German parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "I think this definitely now is the hour of Europe, a European moment, when we have to prepare that, quite probably, America, under the Trump presidency, will stop any financial or military support for Ukraine. But perhaps we also are going to see the attempt to strike a deal between Trump and Putin, so this now means that European security definitely has to become European. So either we stand up or we give up.",
      "However, I think we, the Europeans, are not prepared, despite all the evidence that this had to be expected. Europeans are not prepared, so we have to quickly catch up. It's possible, and the political will is what is lacking most, but we will have to act in a very pragmatic way.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "We have to act in a very pragmatic way to quickly and more substantially support Ukraine, and this means that we have to compensate for the American support in terms of weapons and ammunition delivery and, in the short term, this would mean that the Europeans would have to buy weapons and ammunition on the international market, and in the mid- and longer term we will have to enhance our capabilities to better coordinate, to create bigger markets in order to scale our economies in the area of defense.",
      "Up to now, there is no sufficient political will to do what is necessary to support Ukraine in order to enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. Otherwise, the military situation on the battleground would be different. We are going to see that the United States is not contributing as they have done in the past, so there is a lack of political will, and there is only one way to change this course, and this is by doing more.",
      "This would mean that all European member states like Poland, Germany and France come together and invite other countries; for example, Britain\u2014 we should go beyond the EU because it's about the entire European architecture of security\u2014 come together. And when they come together, they should bring with them substantial additional contributions in terms of money and in terms of weapons and ammunition, and this should be done in the short term. And then they should devise a plan on how to make this a structured effort and what is necessary to be done to better coordinate, to enhance the support necessary for the defense of Ukraine. It should be done very substantially in terms of money and weapons. There are no further words needed. What is needed are deeds.",
      "On NATO:",
      "Of course, it's in the European strategic interest to be a strong part of NATO, to keep the Americans in Europe. This is not against anybody, but it is only to contribute in a stronger way to what is at the heart and what is the core of NATO, and that is European security.",
      "Italy - Natalie Tocci",
      "Director, Istituto Affari Internazionali, and former special adviser to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "He's been saying this for a long time, and in a sense the vision was right back then, and it's even more right now. He started talking about European strategic autonomy in 2017, and there wasn't a lot of appetite and traction behind the idea, given that it has traditionally been mistakenly interpreted as something that runs counter to the transatlantic relationship. So obviously now with Trump, a good idea that was good back then becomes politically relevant today.",
      "From the general concept of the idea to the action, there's a big gap, and he hasn't put forward any new concrete ideas in that respect.",
      "Generally what tends to happen is Macron says something, everyone else criticizes him, but no one really puts forward an alternative vision. So God bless Macron for at least kind of having an idea, and I think in this particular case it's even a good idea, and I do think that the election of Donald Trump is going to galvanize some action, but I'm very skeptical that the kind of action that is going to be insufficient relative to what we have to do.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "We're basically talking about 100 billion euros a year ($104 billion) for several years alongside all member states beginning to spend between 2-and-4% of GDP. This is not going to happen overnight.",
      "There's no antagonism between the EU and NATO, because, frankly speaking, as we're in the midst of a war, we can't really afford to have sort of academic conversations about the EU and NATO. What the EU can contribute is on providing the regulatory and financial incentives for Europeans to do more on defense together.",
      "However, I think there is a lot there to be worked on, and especially if some of these countries begin or increasingly pursue projects collectively. If you think about France, Italy on air defense, think about the Italian-German project on a new tank, there's a lot there that can be worked on.",
      "Does it mean that Europeans would have all defense capacities? Probably not, or certainly not in the short term, so there's still a lot of dependence on the US and US defense industry.",
      "This is not a question of just completely being self-reliant on your own defense industry, but certainly there's a lot more the European defense industry can do and a lot more that governments can do to support that consolidation and cooperation within the defense industry in Europe.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry has settled his lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's British News Group Newspapers for an apology and \"substantial damages.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Britain's Prince Harry has settled his lawsuit against the U.K. newspaper group owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, News Group Newspapers, his lawyer told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Harry and a former senior U.K. lawmaker sued News Group in 2019 over alleged unlawful activities carried out by both tabloid journalists and private investigators employed by its newspapers The Sun and the no-longer-in-circulation News of the World. It was one of a number of lawsuits Harry has brought against newspapers in Britain.",
      "\"NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun,\" the media company said in a statement read out in court Wednesday. The statement also included an apology for the activities of journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.",
      "\"NGN further apologizes to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years. We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the Duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,\" the statement said.",
      "News Group has faced numerous lawsuits over allegations of phone hacking and illegal information gathering, and it has settled more that 1,300 involving politicians and celebrities. It has always denied, however, that The Sun newspaper was involved in any illegal activities, or that senior figures were aware of anything illegal and tried to cover it up.",
      "Harry had previously said he wanted to go to trial to get to the truth, rather than to get a payout, after other claimants settled out of court.",
      "In court documents that emerged in 2023, Prince Harry claimed that his own brother, heir to the British throne Prince William, quietly received \"a very large sum of money\" in a 2020 phone hacking settlement with Murdoch's U.K. newspaper group.",
      "\"After endless resistance, denials and legal battles by News Group Newspapers, including spending more than a billion pounds in payouts and in legal costs (as well as paying-off those in the know) to prevent the full picture from coming out, News UK is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law,\" said a statement read outside the court Wednesday on behalf of Prince Harry and the British lawmaker who brought the suit with him. \"The truth that has now been exposed is that NGN unlawfully engaged more than 100 private investigators over at least 16 years on more than 35,000 occasions. This happened as much at The Sun as it did at the News of the World, with the knowledge of all the Editors and executives, going to the very top of the company.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Emma Jones, a board member of the advocacy group Hacked Off, which has worked with Harry on his lawsuit, said proceedings had been scheduled to resume that morning, but that both sides had appealed for extra time as the settlement talks were underway.",
      "Jones said a \"huge amount of money is going to be passing hands,\" but she said she did not know the exact amount.",
      "She said Harry also wanted \"some sort of admission\u2026 that implicates NGN (News Group). An admission, in a way, of what went on,\" Jones said.",
      "\"He doesn't want to just walk away from this with an apology. He wants something tangible that he can say well, you know, 'I at least have this. I proved my point,'\" Jones said as negotiations continued Tuesday.",

      "A Maine coon cat named Mittens became an accidental jetsetter this month when her cage was overlooked in a plane cargo hold and she made three trips in 24 hours between New Zealand and Australia.",
      "Mittens, 8, was booked for one-way travel with her family from Christchurch, New Zealand to their new home in Melbourne, Australia on Jan. 13. But owner Margo Neas said Wednesday that as she waited for Mittens to be unloaded from the plane's freight area, three hours passed with no sign of the cat.",

      "\"I said, how can this happen? How can this happen? Oh my God,\" Neas said.",
      "The distance from Christchurch, New Zealand to Melbourne, Australia is about 1,500 miles \u2014 meaning the feline traveled roughly 4,500 miles before being reunited with Neas.",
      "The Air New Zealand pilot was told of the extra passenger during the flight and turned on the heating in the cargo hold to keep Mittens comfortable, she added. Neas was told that a stowed wheelchair had obscured a baggage handler's view of Mittens' cage.",
      "\"It was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn't have the family, we weren't complete,\" she said.",
      "But the saga had a happy ending. The pet moving company that Neas used to arrange Mittens' travel met the cat on her return to Christchurch and ensured she was back on the plane for another trip to Melbourne - this time just one way.",

      "Neas told the New Zealand Herald that she received a sympathetic call from the airline's acting sales manager.",

      "Istanbul, Turkey \u2014 A fire engulfed a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, killing at least 76 people and injuring at least 51 more, the interior minister said. Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, and video showed bedsheets hanging from the windows. Officials suggested at least two people died after trying to jump from the building to safety, and the private broadcaster NTV reported three died this way.",
      "At least one of the individuals suffered serious injuries, said Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, while 17 others received treatment for less severe injuries. Survivors who evacuated the building were rehoused in nearby hotels.",

In a statement, the family of Ryan Corbett, an American man held by the Taliban since the summer of 2022, said he was released as part of the deal.",
      "The Taliban-run Afghan Foreign Ministry announced the swap, saying two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008 in the U.S. The Taliban did not identify the Americans being released in the deal.",
      "Corbett, who lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.",
      "The deal, the terms of which were not immediately confirmed by U.S. officials, came as former President Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, handed power over to returning President Trump.

      "Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Last week,\u00a0Biden spoke with relatives of the three Americans\u00a0though there was no deal to get them back at that time, family members said.",
      "Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi.",
      "In a statement released Tuesday by the family of Mahmood Habibi, one of the detained man's brothers, Ahmad Habibi, said they were \"grateful that Ryan and William will be reunited with their families,\" and that they were \"confident that the Trump Administration will make a greater effort to bringing home my brother.\"",
      "\"We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him. My brother is an innocent man who has been held away from his wife, young daughter, and elderly parents for over two years,\" said Ahmad Habibi, adding that his family had been \"frustrated\" by the Biden administration's efforts to free his brother.",
      "\"It was our hope that Ryan, George and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,\" the Corbett family said. \"We recognize the immense privilege of our family's reunion today, and pledge to keep praying \u2014 and fighting \u2014 for George and Mahmoud's swift release.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement, \"We celebrate the release of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty who will soon reunited with their families and loved ones, and also thank the Government of Qatar for their assistance. The Trump Administration will continue to demand the release of all Americans held by the Taliban, especially in light of the billions of dollars in U.S. aid they've received in recent years.\"",

      "An Israeli military operation in a built-up refugee camp in the occupied West Bank killed at least seven people Tuesday, according to Palestinian health officials, as the Israel Defense Forces announced a new \"large scale\" offensive in the area on the third day of a ceasefire in the smaller Gaza Strip.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank, which unlike Gaza has long been militarily occupied by Israel and is not controlled by Hamas, reported the deaths from the new IDF operation.",
      "In a statement released by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said IDF and police forces \"launched an extensive and significant military operation to eradicate terrorism in Jenin.\"",
      "Dubbing the operation \"Iron Wall,\" Netanyahu called it \"another step towards achieving the goal we set \u2014 strengthening security\" in the West Bank and acting \"methodically and resolutely against the Iranian axis wherever it sends its arms.\"",
      "Throughout the 15-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Jenin has been a focus of Israeli raids into the occupied territory. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, launched its own raid into the area late last year.",
      "Violence in the West Bank has surged during the war in Gaza, with Israel saying it is operating to stamp out Iranian-backed militancy. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 800 people have been killed in Israeli raids in the West Bank there since the war began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Several Israelis have also been killed recently in attacks by Palestinians.",
      "The IDF launched its new operation hours after President Trump rescinded Biden-era executive orders that had authorized U.S. sanctions against people who undermine peace in the occupied West Bank, mainly targeting Israeli settlers",
      "The Biden administration used the executive order to impose a handful of sanctions on extremist settlers accused of using violence against Palestinians who live in the West Bank.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts across the West Bank are illegal under international law. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, ruled last summer that Israel should stop settlement activity and end what it called the \"illegal\" occupation \u2014 a ruling that was not legally binding, and which was condemned by the Israeli government.",
      "Settlers have celebrated the incoming Trump administration, believing it will take a more favorable approach to illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel's territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 In President Trump's speech after he was sworn into office for a second term Monday, he outlined a number of policies that would change the U.S.' relationship with the rest of the world. In addition to immediately clamping down on immigration across the southern border, Mr. Trump signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "While some international leaders congratulated Mr. Trump, others were unhappy with his first actions as president. Below is a look at reactions from around the world to Mr. Trump's initial moves.",
      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",
      "Speaking Monday, Mr. Trump accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, saying the agency had failed to act free of \"inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\" and had required \"unfairly onerous payments\" from the U.S., disproportionate to what some other, larger countries, such as China, were paying.",
      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,\" Tedros said. \"We hope the United States will reconsider and we look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue to maintain the partnership between the USA and WHO, for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump saying U.S. will pull out of Paris Climate Accords",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 a move that will take a year to complete and that he initiated during his first term, too \u2014 U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015. Its goal is to prevent \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\" and try \"to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\"",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nationwide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation,\" Stiell said, according to Reuters, adding that there was still room for the new Trump administration to change course.",
      "\"The door remains open to the Paris agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,\" Stiell said.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing European Commission, said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Europe would \"stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\"",
      "She vowed that the the 27-nation EU bloc would adhere to the terms and goals of the Paris agreement, which she said \"continues to be the best hope for all humanity.\"",
      "\"Unusual fear\" in Europe",
      "Georgios Samaras, a lecturer in public policy at King's College London, said European leaders would need to decide how to position themselves in regard to Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "\"I've spoken to colleagues in the European Union, and there is unusual fear right now in the commission, because they don't know what's next,\" Samaras told CBS News. \"I believe that Trump is going to choose his allies very carefully, and those who don't bend the knee will face the consequences of Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"The EU will either find a way to communicate with Trump or, similarly, they might be targeted,\" he predicted.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened the EU with tariffs, but Von der Leyen sent him her \"best wishes.\"",
      "\"The EU looks forward to working closely with you to tackle global challenges,\" the EU leader said in a social media post. \"Together, our societies can achieve greater prosperity and strengthen their common security. This is the enduring strength of the transatlantic partnership.\"",
      "Reaction from other global voices to Trump's inauguration",
      "The initial reactions from many world leaders were congratulatory, despite simmering tension between Mr. Trump and some longstanding U.S. allies.",
      "\"For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been repeatedly attacked in recent weeks by Trump appointee Elon Musk on social media, said. \"With President Trump's longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.\"",
      "In his final days in office, former President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsored terrorism. Mr. Trump immediately reversed that move, which Cuba's president Miquel Diaz-Canal called, \"an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.\"",
      "Mr. Trump again threatened in his inaugural address to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded shortly after his speech, reiterating in a statement that \"the Canal is and will continue being Panamanian, and its administration will continue being under Panama's control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\"",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Mr. Trump's executive orders paving the way for U.S. troops to be sent to the southern border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum said that the orders were similar to policies under Mr. Trump's previous administrations and that Mexico was, therefore, prepared.",
      "\"They can act in their territories within the framework of their constitution. What we say is: Stay away from our sovereignty, from our independence. We can coordinate, but we are a free, independent and sovereign country and we are going to seek coordination,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "She also criticized Mr. Trump's order to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "\"For us and for the whole world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not immediately impose new tariffs on China, as he'd indicated he might, and he recently delayed a ban on Chinese-owned TikTok that was conceived under his previous administration and passed under Biden's administration.",
      "\"China stands ready to work with the new U.S. government under the strategic guidance of the two presidents,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Guo said Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. \"Economic ties between China and the US are essentially mutually beneficial despite differences and disputes. China believes there is space for cooperation and dialogue in this trade area and both countries can engage in more talks.\"",
      "In a video statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that \"the best days of our alliance are yet to come.\"",
      "\"Your first term as President was filled with groundbreaking moments,\" Netanyahu said. \"I'm confident that we will complete the defeat of Iran's terror axis and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for our region.\"",
      "In Iran, the semi-official student news agency cited the country's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Kazem Gharibabadi as saying Tehran, as in the past, was ready to engage in direct negotiations with the new U.S. administration with the aim of getting sanctions lifted.",
      "\"If there will be also the same intention on the other side, the talks will take place and can reach a conclusion,\" Gharibabadi said.",
      "On the streets of Tehran, Iranians who spoke with CBS News voiced apprehension, given Mr. Trump's previous hard line on policy regarding their country and the devastating impact of the sanctions already in place.",
      "Kimia, a 26-year-old art graduate who declined to give her full name told CBS News that she hoped Mr. Trump would resume his \"maximum pressure\" tactic against her country's leaders, to force it to change its domestic policies and allocate more resources for the good of the Iranian people \"rather than other countries.\"",
      "But others voiced hope that Mr. Trump might usher new negotiations with Iran's relatively new, reform-minded\u00a0President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "\"This time, I believe President Trump and Iranian President Mr. Pezeshkian can have a positive negotiation, and there is hope that it will end up well for the Iranian people,\" said Mayan, a 29-year-old master student in Tehran.",
      "At a Russian security council meeting hours before Mr. Trump was sworn in, President Vladimir Putin praised the new administration for aiming to restore direct communication channels that Moscow says the Biden White House interrupted.",
      "\"Naturally, we welcome this stance and extend our congratulations to the President-elect of the United States of America on his inauguration,\" Putin said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also congratulated Mr. Trump on Monday.",
      "\"President Trump is always decisive, and the peace through strength policy he announced provides an opportunity to strengthen American leadership and achieve a long-term and just peace, which is the top priority,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "It is unclear how Mr. Trump will handle the war in Ukraine after vowing on the campaign trail to end the conflict there quickly. The U.S. has been providing huge amounts of military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In a separate video message, Zelenskyy said the new American administration offered a good opportunity to achieve peace.",

      "While there are other avenues for communication, like the outreach of medical societies and individuals, LaPook said, \"it's nice to have a coordinated effort.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he will again withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Monday he will again withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, dealing a blow to worldwide efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies.",
      "The announcement, which came the day\u00a0Mr. Trump was sworn in to a second term, echoed Trump's actions in 2017, when he announced that the U.S. would abandon the global Paris accord. President Biden later rejoined.",
      "As he signed a series of executive actions following his inauguration, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accords.\" He also signed a letter informing the U.N. of his decision.",
      "It takes a full year to formally withdraw from the agreement, so while Mr. Trump has announced his intentions, it will not go into effect until Jan. 20, 2026.",
      "The pact is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, keeping temperatures at least well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. is one of the world's top carbon polluting nations.",
      "The 2015 Paris agreement is voluntary and allows nations to provide targets to cut their own emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Those targets are supposed to become more stringent over time, with countries facing a February 2025 deadline for new individual plans.",
      "The outgoing Biden administration last month offered a plan to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60% by 2035.",
      "Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris agreement, called the planned U.S. withdrawal unfortunate but said action to slow climate change \"is stronger than any single country's politics and policies.\"",
      "The global context for Trump's action is \"very different to 2017,\" Tubiana said, adding that \"there is unstoppable economic momentum behind the global transition, which the U.S has gained from and led but now risks forfeiting.\"",
      "The International Energy Agency expects the global market for key clean energy technologies to triple to more than $2 trillion by 2035, she said.",
      "\"The impacts of the climate crisis are also worsening. The terrible wildfires in Los Angeles are the latest reminder that Americans, like everyone else, are affected by worsening climate change,\" Tubiana said.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom put it bluntly in a statement Monday night, sharing photos of the devastating L.A. fires and the message: \"If you don't believe in science, believe your own damn eyes.\"",
      "Dr. Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS, called the withdrawal \"a travesty.\"",
      "\"Such a move is in clear defiance of scientific realities and shows an administration cruelly indifferent to the harsh climate change impacts that people in the United States and around the world are experiencing. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is an abdication of responsibility and undermines the very global action that people at home and abroad desperately need,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Gina McCarthy, who served as White House climate adviser under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said that if Trump, a Republican, \"truly wants America to lead the global economy, become energy independent and create good-paying American jobs,\" then he must \"stay focused on growing our clean energy industry. Clean technologies are driving down energy costs for people all across our country.\"",
      "The world is now long-term 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 degrees Celsius) above mid-1800s temperatures. Most but not all climate monitoring agencies said global temperatures last year passed the warming mark of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and all said it was the warmest year on record.",
      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October\u00a0U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "The withdrawal process from the Paris accord takes one year. Trump's previous withdrawal took effect the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.",
      "While the first Trump-led withdrawal from the landmark U.N. agreement \u2014 adopted by 196 nations \u2014 shocked and angered nations across the globe, \"not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,\" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G.",
      "Instead, other nations renewed their commitment to slowing climate change, along with investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others in the U.S., Meyer and other experts said.",
      "Still, they lamented the loss of U.S. leadership in global efforts to slow climate change, even as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.",
      "\"Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,\" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. \"For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.\"",
      "About half of Americans \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" oppose U.S. action to withdraw from the climate accord, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly in favor, according according to a poll\u00a0from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" in favor of withdrawing from the Paris agreement, while about one-quarter are neutral.",
      "Much of the opposition to U.S. withdrawal comes from Democrats, but Republicans display some ambivalence as well. Slightly less than half of Republicans are in favor of withdrawing from the climate accord, while about 2 in 10 are opposed.",
      "China several years ago passed the United States as the world's largest annual carbon dioxide emitting nation. The U.S. \u2014 the second biggest annual carbon polluting country \u2014 put 4.9 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in the air in 2023, down 11% from a decade earlier, according to the scientists who track emissions for the Global Carbon Project.",
      "But carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere for centuries, so the United States has put more of the heat-trapping gas that is now in the air than any other nation. The U.S. is responsible for nearly 22% of the carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere since 1950, according to Global Carbon Project.",
      "While global efforts to fight climate change continued during Trump's first term, many experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries, especially China, could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.",
      "Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate change executive secretary, held out hope that the U.S. would continue to embrace the global clean energy boom.",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse,\" Stiell said. \"The door remains open to the Paris Agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries.\"",

    "story": [
      "For the first time in 471 days, Palestinian medics in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip didn't report a single death from Israeli military action on Monday, as a tense ceasefire between Hamas and Israel settled into place. CBS News teams in Israel, Gaza and in the occupied West Bank saw more joy \u2014 or at least relief \u2014 than had been painted on the faces of residents for 15 months.",
      "The ceasefire came into effect Sunday after an initial three-hour delay, during which almost 20 more Palestinians were killed, according to medics in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, which the U.S. helped broker along with Qatar and Egypt, three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas on Sunday after the fighting stopped. Just after midnight local time, 90 Palestinian prisoners were freed from an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "After more than a year of devastating war sparked by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, the people of Gaza heard the sound of children playing Monday instead of the thunder of fighter jets and airstrikes, observed Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, in a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Our teams reported a good first day of the ceasefire,\" he said, adding that aid and some commercial supplies had started flowing smoothly into Gaza on Sunday. Along with the reciprocal release of hostages and prisoners, that is the other major component of the ceasefire deal. At least 600 aid trucks per day are supposed to enter Gaza, carrying everything from desperately needed food and medicine to fuel for generators.",
      "\"The ceasefire must continue to hold and all elements of the agreement must be implemented,\" said Lazzarini. \"It is a step in the right direction towards long-lasting peace and stability for all.\"",
      "Palestinians eager to return to obliterated homes in Gaza",
      "Reconstructing Gaza will be an incredibly long and costly process, and it is only provisioned to begin in earnest during the third and final phase of the three-phase ceasefire agreement, which, assuming the deal remains in-tact, could be several months away. Still, the Hamas-run Gaza City Municipality said in a statement Monday that it started to at least clear the main roads, which had been closed during the war.",
      "That will help as tens of thousands of displaced civilians plod back toward their towns and villages across the enclave, to assess the damage caused to their homes, and attempt to make use of whatever they can salvage from the ruins.",
      "Thousands of families have started walking or dragging carts from displacement camps in Gaza City toward the razed towns and cities of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip.",
      "They have also been returning to the southern city of Rafah, where CBS News' team spoke with one girl wearing a dress in the pattern of the Palestinian flag.",
      "\"This is the moment that all of Gaza's citizens were waiting for,\" she said. \"Thank God the war has ended\u2026 It is time to celebrate after enduring the pain. It is time to reconstruct after all of the destruction. Gaza's children are drawing a new future.\"",
      "Civil Defense rescue teams have continued recovering the decomposing bodies of dozens of people killed during the war, both from underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and from the streets. The Civil Defense has estimated that some 10,000 bodies could still be buried under the rubble of demolished homes in Gaza.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Monday that hospitals across the enclave had received the bodies of 122 people recovered since the ceasefire took effect alone, including 62 pulled from rubble, raising the total number of fatalities in Gaza since the war began to 47,035. The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties, but says the vast majority of those killed have been civilians, including tens of thousands of women and children.",
      "Joyous reunions for 3 Israeli families, hope for dozens more",
      "A Red Cross convoy driving into Gaza City on Sunday was the first sign that Hamas was keeping its end of the bargain.\u00a0 But the hostage handover was chaotic; heavily armed Hamas fighters surrounded and climbed over the vehicles \u2014 a clear display of force and resilience after more than a year of war against Israel's vastly superior military.",
      "But soon the world and the desperate families back home got a first glimpse of the three women being released as they bolted between cars, and to freedom.",
      "Held hostage in fear for 15 months by Hamas, 24-year-old Romi Gonen, 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher and 28-year-old Emily Damari were finally on their way to being back in the eager arms of their loved ones. The three women \u2014 including Damari, an Israeli-British national who lost two fingers during the Oct. 7 attack when she was abducted \u2014 were all reunited with their mothers as soon as they reached Israel.",
      "\"Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,\" Damari's mother Mandy said in a statement released Monday. \"I am relieved to report that after her release, Emily is doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated\u2026 In Emily's own words, she is the happiest girl in the world; she has her life back.\"",
      "Even in her moment of intense joy, Mandy Damari stressed that other families were still waiting to share in the elation.",
      "\"We must also remember that 94 other hostages still remain,\" she said. \"The ceasefire must continue and every last hostage must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Hundreds of Israelis watching from Hostage Square in Tel Aviv also shared in the joy Sunday night \u2014 including some whose own loved ones didn't make it out of Hamas captivity \u2014 or haven't yet.",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was among those kidnapped. Her body was recovered during an Israeli military operation at the beginning of September. Still, Dickmann has regularly attended the demonstrations in Hostage Square calling for the return of the dozens of others. He told CBS News that when he saw the women emerge from the vehicles on Sunday, he struggled to even believe it.",
      "\"My God, it's them,\" he said he'd told himself. \"All the people around the world should have this joy - of people coming back home alive. It is still the happiest thing that you can ever, ever live through.\"",
      "Celebrations in the West Bank as Palestinian prisoners released",
      "There was elation and celebrations in the Israeli occupied West Bank late on Sunday night, too, as 90 Palestinian detainees, mostly women, were released in exchange for the freed hostages.",
      "\"They were treating us like animals,\" said 18-year-old Rose Quis.",
      "\"I left hell, and now I'm in heaven,\" said Abdelaziz Atawneh  as he emerged from Israel's Ofer prison, just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah.",
      "The freed detainees were greeted by fireworks, whistling and shouts of \"God is great,\" and many were hoisted onto the shoulders of the massive crowds that had gathered outside the prison \u2014 many of them waiting all day for the release.",
      "According to a list provided by the Palestinian Authority, which administers the West Bank, all of those released in the very early hours of Monday were women or teenagers, the youngest just 15. They were jailed by Israel, many of them without formal charges, for alleged offenses ranging from throwing stones to attempted murder.",
      "The next swap of hostages for prisoners is scheduled to take place on Saturday under the ceasefire deal, with four hostages to be released in exchange for about 120 Palestinian prisoners. In total, 33 Israeli hostages are to be released during the first six-week phase of the agreement.",

Axel Rudakubana, 18, entered the surprise plea as jury selection had been expected to begin at the start of his trial in Liverpool Crown Court.",
      "The July 29 stabbings sent shock waves across the U.K. and led to a week of widespread rioting across parts of England and Northern Ireland after the suspect was falsely identified as an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. He was actually born in Wales.",
      "The rampage occurred on the first day of summer vacation when the little girls at the Hart Space, a facility hidden behind a row of houses, were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "\"This was an unspeakable attack \u2014 one which left an enduring mark on our community and the nation for its savagery and senselessness,\" Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle said. \"A day which should have been one of carefree innocence; of children enjoying a dance workshop and making friendship bracelets, became a scene of the darkest horror as Axel Rudakubana carried out his meticulously planned rampage.\"",
      "Prosecutors haven't said what they believe led Rudakubana \u2014 who was days shy of his 18th birthday \u2014 to commit the atrocities but Doyle said it was clear he had a \"a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence.\"",
      "Rudakubana had consistently refused to speak in court and did so once again when asked to identify himself at the start of the proceedings. But he broke his silence when he was read the 16-count indictment and asked to enter a plea, replying \"guilty\" to each charge.",
      "He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaeda manual.",

But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not \"the rarest of the rare cases,\" and ordered that Roy must spend his life behind bars.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital's seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
      "Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime.",
      "The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim.",
      "Indian doctors in government hospitals across several states also staged a strike to protest the rape and murder.",

      "Many cases of\u00a0crimes against women\u00a0go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "The nationwide outrage and protests were similar to those seen after the\u00a02012 gang-rape and murder\u00a0of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus. That vicious attack prompted India to enact tougher laws against sexual violence, but according to the latest available government data, as recently as 2022 authorities were still registering about 90 rapes on average per day.",

If the Writers Guild strike delayed production by an entire year, there's no telling when Hollywood will get back to 'business as usual' based on the images we've seen on TV over the last week.\"",
      "He continued, \"But the inevitable outsourcing of production won't be caused by the fires themselves; several years ago, states like Georgia and Texas began giving significant tax incentives to filmmakers in order to move production to their states. California might be home to Hollywood, but it's also home to one of the most prohibitive (and arguably, punitive) tax structures in the entire country. We had already seen the beginning of a slow migration of production out of California; I think these fires will only serve to fast-track that creative exodus.\"",

      "\"If there is a switch at the state level government, there may be something that happens there.

      "The impressive, whole-of-government security effort on Inauguration Day was unprecedented, and not without reason: Trump was the victim of two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign \u2014 including a shooter who came so close to him as to nick his ear \u2014 and a domestic threat landscape that was heightened further by the terrorist-inspired attack in New Orleans and the execution-style killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan late last year.",

This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you've noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.",
      "A computer's CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating.

However, there's a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor.",
      "When you open one of these monitoring tools, you'll be able to view your PC's stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling.

In addition to causing shut-offs and restart loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC's power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.",
      "Desktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU.

      "An issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there's a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes.

      "If there's no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you'll see a message that says, \"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\" If you instead see a message saying, \"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\" you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.",
      "Fix #8 - Check for RAM issues in the command prompt",
      "Your PC might be restarting itself because it doesn't have access to enough random access memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here's what you need to do:",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.",

      "It starts with an email inviting the person to schedule an interview for a job. But when they click the link, it installs a malicious app that secretly mines cryptocurrency.\u00a0This app hijacks your PC\u2019s resources, like the CPU and GPU, which slows down its performance significantly.",

      "This malicious campaign begins with an email that tricks victims into thinking it is part of a recruitment process, as reported by\u00a0Dark Reading. In most cases, these emails are pretending to be from recruiters at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "The fraudulent email contains a link claiming to take the recipient to a site where they can schedule an interview. However, in reality, it redirects the victim to a malicious website that offers a download for a supposed \"CRM application.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The site provides download options for both Windows and macOS. Regardless of which option the victim selects, the download will be a Windows executable written in Rust. This executable then downloads the XMRig cryptominer.",

      "A cryptomining app can significantly impact your PC\u2019s performance. Once installed, it hijacks your computer's resources, including the CPU and GPU, to secretly mine cryptocurrency. This process requires a lot of computational power, which can cause your system to slow down drastically. You might notice your computer becoming unresponsive, running hotter than usual, or consuming more power.",
      "In some cases, prolonged use of cryptominers can also lead to hardware damage due to the increased strain on your components. Additionally, these miners often run in the background without your knowledge, making it harder to detect the issue until the damage is already done.",
      "CrowdStrike is aware of the scam and advises individuals to stay vigilant.\u00a0\"This campaign highlights the importance of vigilance against phishing scams, particularly those targeting job seekers. Individuals in the recruitment process should verify the authenticity of CrowdStrike communications and avoid downloading unsolicited files,\" the\u00a0company said in a blog post.",

Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",

It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data.

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 06:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers found in a study that users of a robotic prosthetic hand could successfully grasp and move two objects at once without dropping them.",
    "story": [
      "Study participants successfully grasped and transported two objects at once without dropping them.",
      "Prosthetic hands have long struggled to replicate the dexterity and functionality of natural hands, often limiting users to a single grasp function at a time.",
      "This limitation has made everyday tasks, such as typing on a keyboard or braiding hair, challenging for those who rely on prosthetics.",
      "However, a groundbreaking study from Florida Atlantic University (FAU) offers promising advancements that could transform the experience of prosthetic hand users.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Man sporting wearable soft robotic armband (Florida Atlantic University)",
      "New technology enables users to grasp two objects at once",
      "Researchers at FAU's College of Engineering and Computer Science, in collaboration with the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, conducted an innovative study that combined haptic feedback, electromyogram control and a wearable soft robotic armband. This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",
      "For example, participants managed to pinch a card between their fingers while simultaneously unscrewing a water bottle lid or toggling a light switch with their little finger.",
      "Prosthetic robot hand (Florida Atlantic University)",
      "NEW PROSTHETICS RESTORE NATURAL MOVEMENT VIA NERVE CONNECTION",
      "Multichannel soft robotic armband",
      "A key innovation in this research was the development of a multichannel soft robotic armband designed to convey artificial sensations of touch. This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Participants in the study reported that haptic feedback was significantly more important than visual feedback, especially since visual cues often failed to indicate when an object was about to be lost. This insight underscores the necessity of integrating tactile sensations into prosthetic technology.",

      "BREAKTHROUGH PROSTHETIC FINGERS REVOLUTIONIZE THE LIVES OF AMPUTEES",
      "Implications for future prosthetic design",
      "The implications of this study extend beyond immediate user benefits; they suggest a paradigm shift in how prosthetic hands could be controlled in the future. By enabling refined dexterous control through enhanced sensory feedback, this research opens new pathways for individuals with upper limb loss to engage in complex tasks traditionally deemed impossible with current prosthetics. This includes activities such as playing musical instruments or performing intricate surgical procedures.",
      "In addition, the researchers noted that participants with limb loss performed as well as able-bodied subjects in key performance metrics during the tasks. This finding is particularly encouraging for clinical applications and indicates that advancements in technology can bridge gaps in functionality for users.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Amid the whirl of orders Donald Trump issued in the early hours of his presidency, one was conspicuous in its absence: new tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump had pledged to impose 25% tariffs on both countries on Day One of his presidency to pressure them to keep migrants and drugs out of the United States.",
      "The delay doesn\u2019t mean Trump is backing off the tariffs, his advisers say, but it does suggest he\u2019s carving out more time to negotiate with both countries, study the issue further and put in place top economic advisers who are still moving through the Senate confirmation gauntlet.",
      "Asked about the timing of the tariffs, Trump told reporters Monday night, \u201cI think we\u2019ll do it Feb. 1.\u201d He reiterated that timeline Tuesday in taking questions again from the media, and said China could also be subject to a 10% tariff starting Feb. 1.",
      "Yet the fine print of a memorandum about trade policy he issued Monday gave his aides a deadline of April 1 to send him a report assessing the migration and fentanyl flows from Mexico, Canada and China. The memo also called for recommendations the same day for \u201cappropriate trade and national security measures to resolve that emergency.\u201d",
      "The study is to come from Trump\u2019s commerce and homeland security secretaries. Neither of his nominees for those positions, Howard Lutnick and Kristi Noem, respectively, has yet been confirmed.",
      "Follow live politics coverage",
      "Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, told NBC News in a statement Tuesday: \u201cPresident Trump will move on his America First trade agenda forward swiftly based on a set of foundational studies. These actions will be done \u2018in Trump time,\u2019 which is to say as quickly as possible on behalf of our economic and national security.\u201d",
      "It would be tough to overstate Trump\u2019s regard for tariffs, the trade tool he is expected to use both to gain leverage in foreign relations and to raise revenue to cover his tax cut plan. Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago last year, Trump said, \u201cThe most beautiful word in the dictionary is \u2018tariff.\u2019\u201d",
      "Not all his economic advisers are as smitten, worrying about a tit-for-tat trade war with other countries. In Trump\u2019s first term, a \u201cglobalist\u201d group of advisers sparred with a protectionist wing \u2014 Navarro among them \u2014 that was more amenable to tariffs.",
      "Those tensions are expected to carry over in the new term, with some advisers favoring a hawkish approach to tariffs and others a more targeted strategy.",
      "Within Trump\u2019s economic team, advisers have been discussing how to move forward on tariffs, a person familiar with the talks said. Despite Trump\u2019s initial vow to slap tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in power, people involved in the discussions didn\u2019t expect that to happen even in Week One, the person said, noting that key economic and trade officials aren\u2019t yet on the job.",
      "Though Trump\u2019s faith in tariffs appears ironclad, Canada believes he is open to a deal in which he backs off. What Trump says amounts to \u201cpositioning,\u201d a Canadian official said in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "\"President Trump is a businessman and he is a negotiator, and a lot of his threats have been linked to things around the border that he wants to see changed,\" the official added.",
      "Trump stepped up his complaints about Canada in his Q&A with reporters Tuesday. Both Canada and Mexico, he said, have \u201callowed millions and millions of people to come into our country that shouldn\u2019t be here. They could have stopped them, and they didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Tariffs could prove useful in paying for a sweeping, multitrillion-dollar legislative package that Trump hopes to pass involving his immigration, energy and tax agendas.",
      "Said the person involved in discussions around a tariff plan, including on Capitol Hill: \u201cMembers that are involved in drafting [the package] know that they have to come up with a significant amount of revenue. And if the Trump administration does implement broad-based or universal tariffs, then they can account for that revenue. ... So that\u2019s how they\u2019ll do it.\u201d",
      "Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally and Republican former House speaker, offered another idea for putting tariff proceeds to good use: Send Americans checks through Trump\u2019s proposed new \u201cExternal Revenue Service.\"",
      "\u201cYou can imagine a tariff rebate check to every American,\u201d Gingrich said in an interview. \u201cThat would have considerable impact.\u201d"

      "But Trump did not sign an order imposing tariffs on any foreign nation on his first day in office. Asked in the Oval Office on Monday evening, Trump said he was considering 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, two top trading partners for the United States. Asked when the tariffs would be imposed, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll do it Feb. 1st.\u201d",

      "Trump began backing off of that promise after the election. In remarks to the media at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Florida, he was asked when he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war. Trump said it would be inappropriate to hold the meeting before his inauguration.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues. When Trump was asked in the Oval Office on Monday about his promise to end the war on Day One, he said: \u201cWell, there\u2019s only half a day. I have another half a day left. We\u2019ll see. We want to get it done.\u201d",
      "Asked again later about his promise, Trump said he needed to speak with Putin and teased that the conversation \u201ccould be very soon.\u201d",
      "Trump also pledged at a rally in September that said the auto industry would be \u201cfueled by American energy,\u201d \u201csourced by American suppliers\u201d and built by American laborers on his \"first day in office.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s executive orders did not include those specific measures aimed at the auto industry.",

On Monday night he granted pardons to and commuted sentences for roughly 1,500 defendants charged with crimes related to the riot.",
      "Back in December, Trump did not rule out pardoning those who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers, saying he would look at \u201ceverything.\u201d And he did end up issuing pardons to or commutations for those rioters, also calling for those in prison to be released \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office, and he followed through, signing an order Monday that said children born to parents who are not legal, permanent residents should not be considered U.S. citizens. But his move was quickly met with legal challenges, and it could ultimately be struck down by the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump has been focused on the border since his first campaign for president, and it was a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. On the trail, he pledged to \u201cterminate every open-borders policy of the Biden administration\u201d on Day One.",

      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s health care agenda for a second term takes shape, it\u2019s becoming clear that many Joe Biden-era policies won\u2019t make the cut.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed a sweeping order aimed in part at reversing several Biden administration executive orders on health care, including efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs for people on Medicare and Medicaid, enhancing the Affordable Care Act and increasing protections for Medicaid enrollees. The so-called initial rescissions order, according to the Trump White House, is aimed at Biden policies that it says are \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d and \u201cradical.\u201d",
      "The moves by Trump, experts say, are likely to be inconsequential to many Americans in terms of what they pay in out-of-pocket health care costs.",
      "One Biden effort overturned by Trump, for example, had directed Medicare to look at ways to lower drug costs, including whether to impose a $2 monthly out-of-pocket cap on certain generic drugs.",
      "That initiative, however, was only in the development stage, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and it was unclear whether it would be implemented at all.",
      "Biden\u2019s bigger health care initiatives, such as a $35 monthly cap on insulin, a $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs and Medicare\u2019s negotiating drug pricing provision weren\u2019t affected by Trump\u2019s executive actions Monday.",
      "\u201cWhen administrations change over, many of them want to undo some of the actions of other presidents, even when those are more symbolic,\u201d Dusetzina said.",
      "Still, she said, Trump\u2019s move signals that the incoming administration may be unwilling to move forward on any policies laid out by its predecessor.",
      "\u201cIt could mean that the Trump administration is not interested in pursuing any of the work that has since developed out of these executive orders,\u201d she said.",
      "A change in priorities",
      "Some of the actions Monday were expected, experts say, including weakening the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a primary goal during Trump's first term.",
      "Trump overturned a policy that had extended Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period an additional 12 weeks in 36 states, giving uninsured adults more time to sign up.",
      "He also rescinded an order aimed at strengthening Medicaid, which included providing more outreach funding to states.",
      "Some of the policies eliminated, however, had previously aligned with Trump\u2019s goals \u2014 possibly indicating a change in his priorities, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president of health policy at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues.",
      "In jettisoning Biden\u2019s order to look into new ways to lower out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs, Levitt said, it could signal that Trump is less serious about addressing the cost of health care in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTrump is kind of wiping the slate clean,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you contrast Day 1 of this Trump administration with the last one, it is a different approach to health care.\u201d",
      "Levitt said it remains unclear whether the Trump administration supports Medicare\u2019s negotiating drug prices, a key provision in Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Last week, Medicare announced the next round of prescription drugs up for negotiations, including Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "\u201cTrump could signal that he wants to continue drug price negotiation, or, alternatively, try to repeal it,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe Trump administration has quite a bit of leeway to choose to negotiate more aggressively or less aggressively.\u201d",
      "Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said that for now, it appears that Trump is proceeding on health care costs \u201cwith great caution,\u201d leaving Biden\u2019s bigger initiatives alone.",
      "Although Trump has advocated for a minimalist approach to government, Caplan said Trump is aware that the U.S. pays much higher prices for care than other countries and that the government may need to intervene.",
      "Caplan said he hopes Trump leaves the Medicare negotiation provision in place.",
      "\u201cRight now, he seems to be nibbling on the edges,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cBut I hope he doesn\u2019t go further.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Most claims about the dangers of seed oils tend to focus at least in part on inflammation \u2014 more specifically, that seed oils contain large amounts of omega-6s relative to omega-3s.",
    "story": [
      "A year or two ago, chances are you\u2019d never given much thought to the concept of \u201cseed oils.\u201d But in 2025, they\u2019re becoming harder to ignore.",
      "On social media and popular podcasts, wellness influencers warn of the dangers of consuming the \u201cHateful Eight\u201d: canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean and sunflower oil. Late last year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary \u2014 repeated those claims on X, arguing that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by seed oils. (Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "It\u2019s even become the stuff of online parody: In a recent post on TikTok, a young person pretends to saut\u00e9 a pan that appears to be filled with mini bottles of Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, while intoning, \u201cThe most important thing about this meal is avoiding seed oils.\u201d",
      "Now, at least some in the food industry are making changes. The CEO of Sweetgreen this month announced the introduction of the restaurant\u2019s \u201cfirst-ever seed oil-free menu.\u201d A spokesperson for Sweetgreen told NBC News in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to connect people to real food and give options to our guests that we can be proud of.\u201d",
      "But nutrition experts say the worries swirling around seed oils are, in essence, a reheated, repackaged wellness fad.",
      "\u201cThis has been coming and going for 20 years,\u201d said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the director of the Food Is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. And the focus on seed oils, Mozaffarian and other experts argue, misses the bigger picture when it comes to improving Americans\u2019 health.",
      "What are the concerns about seed oils \u2014 and where did they come from?",
      "When critics talk about seed oils, \u201cI really think what they\u2019re after is the omega-6, omega-3 thing,\u201d said Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center. (Gardner also served on the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.)",
      "The \u201comega-6, omega-3 thing\u201d he\u2019s referring to is a wellness idea that dates to at least the 2000s, when chatter circulated in nutrition circles about the supposed dangers of omega-6 fatty acids, which could increase inflammation and thus lead to chronic illness like heart disease or diabetes, or so the thinking went. Eventually, those voicing these claims became loud enough to prompt the American Heart Association to issue a scientific advisory laying out the evidence for the health benefits of omega-6s, particularly concerning cardiovascular disease.",
      "Given that context, Gardner said, it becomes easier to begin to understand the claims about the dangers of seed oils, which can sometimes seem as if they came out of nowhere.",
      "Most claims about the dangers of seed oils tend to focus at least in part on inflammation \u2014 more specifically, that seed oils contain large amounts of omega-6s relative to omega-3s. Current seed oil skeptics say this ratio is pro-inflammatory and can lead to chronic illness.",
      "Omega-6s are fatty acids; so are omega-3s. Most fats, Gardner explained, are converted to energy in the body. \u201cA very small number of our fats \u2014 and it\u2019s these omega-6s and omega-3s \u2014 actually get converted to hormone-like substances,\u201d Gardner explained. He added that these fatty acids play a role in regulating blood pressure, vasodilation, clotting and triglyceride levels in the blood, all processes that are related to inflammatory response, he said.",
      "\u201cThe omega-3s are a little less inflammatory than the omega-6s,\u201d Gardner said.\u00a0\u201cThere are some byproducts of omega-6s that could contribute in some way to inflammation, but the net impact is not pro-inflammatory.\u201d",
      "But there are also health benefits associated with\u00a0omega-6s.",
      "\u201cOmega-6s, in dozens and dozens of randomized controlled trials in people, improve blood cholesterol levels \u2014 multiple aspects of blood cholesterol levels, from increasing the good cholesterol, like HDL, reducing LDL cholesterol, reducing triglycerides to improving glucose and insulin levels,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ironic, because many of the influencers talk about diabetes \u2014 and there\u2019s well-established randomized trials showing that omega-6 fatty acids actually improve glucose, improve insulin resistance, improve insulin secretion by the pancreas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re extremely healthy,\u201d he added.",
      "Zeroing in on these fatty acids isn\u2019t the best way of understanding whether a food is healthy, Gardner said. \u201cThe big deal is, is it saturated or unsaturated?\u201d he said.",
      "Both omega-3s and omega-6s are a type of unsaturated fat \u2014 specifically, polyunsaturated fatty acids. Data shows that eating polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats can lower heart disease risk. Most saturated fats come from animal products, like meat and dairy. The foods that account for the biggest sources of saturated fats in Americans\u2019 diets include cheese, pizza, ice cream and eggs.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s omega-6 or omega-3 is fairly trivial,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThey\u2019re both good for you.\u201d",
      "Some of the claims about seed oils aren\u2019t wrong \u2014 but they are misguided, experts say",
      "It\u2019s true, as Kennedy and other detractors claim, that Americans are consuming more seed oils and less animal fat than we were a century ago. But we\u2019re also eating more fast food and highly processed foods, both of which tend to contain large amounts of seed oil.",
      "\u201cIf you look through the grocery store, let\u2019s say 70% of the grocery store is packaged foods in the middle aisles,\u201d said Lisa Young, a registered dietician and adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University. \u201cWe have tons of junk that we\u2019re consuming. These seed oils are the foundation of all that junk.\u201d",
      "The problem, in other words, is just as likely to be the excessive refined carbohydrates, salt and sugar Americans are eating along with the seed oils.",
      "It\u2019s tempting to zoom in on a specific nutrient and blame America\u2019s health woes for it, said Alice Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science at Tufts University. Carbs, calories and fat, for example, have all assumed the role of nutritional villain in the past several decades. But it\u2019s more helpful to consider overall dietary patterns, she said. Are the people who consume the most seed oils doing so because they\u2019re saut\u00e9ing vegetables in safflower oil at home? Or are they eating more seed oils because they\u2019re eating more packaged foods?",
      "\u201cCertainly dietary patterns that are higher in fish \u2026 are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease,\u201d Lichtenstein said. But, she added, diets that are higher in fish also tend to be lower in saturated fat and higher in monounsaturated fat. \u201cPeople [who eat fish also] tend to be more active and they tend to smoke less and have other factors that are associated with better health outcomes,\u201d she said.",
      "In other words, one good health habit tends to beget another, and the same goes for bad health habits. Zeroing in on one nutritional component misses that bigger picture, Lichtenstein said.",
      "Is there any potential harm in avoiding seed oils?",
      "All that said, choosing to avoid seed oils poses no inherent danger to your health, experts said. But there are downsides.",
      "Avoiding seed oils entirely would mean cooking all your foods at home \u2014 and that means all your food, including things like salad dressing, sauces and even bread, said Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic. That takes more time than many busy Americans have, she said.",
      "Many weekends, Zumpano packs a day\u2019s worth of snacks for her three kids during their long days of basketball games. It takes time and effort, but for Zumpano, it\u2019s worth it to avoid feeding her children the processed food on offer at the gym. (She doesn\u2019t make the effort specifically to avoid seed oils, but by avoiding processed foods, she ends up avoiding seed oils, too.)",
      "\u201cAll they have to eat is hot dogs, chips, a bowl of noodles,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one fresh food item there.\u201d",
      "But, again, not every parent has the time to prepare and pack an entire day\u2019s worth of fresh food, Zumpano said. Also, seed oils are often cheaper than many alternatives, she added.",
      "Those on a budget might not have the option to swap canola oil for comparatively expensive containers of olive oil or avocado oil, both of which are monounsaturated fats. \u201cThose kinds of fats, compared to the polyunsaturated omega-6s, are less susceptible to rancidity,\u201d Young said.",
      "For Gardner, it\u2019s also a matter of taste. Sometimes you need a neutral oil, he pointed out. \u201cIf you\u2019re cooking corn muffins, do you want to put olive oil in your corn muffin? No, I\u2019m going to put corn oil in my corn muffins, because I don\u2019t want the strong taste of olive oil in my corn muffin,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be really weird.\u201d",
      "But what\u2019s replacing the seed oils? That\u2019s the real potential health concern, experts say",
      "Really, the trouble with avoiding seed oils is about what people choose to use instead, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think the potential harm will be if enough consumers raise this as a concern, and the industry stops using these oils or restaurants stop using the oil, they\u2019ll use worse alternatives,\u201d Mozaffarian said.",
      "By \u201cworse alternatives,\u201d he means animal fats like butter, lard or beef tallow, all of which are higher in saturated fat than seed oils. Saturated fat is linked to cardiovascular disease and weight gain.",
      "\u201cAnimal fats are healthier than white bread,\u201d Mozaffarian said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not healthier than seed oils.\u201d",
      "Instead of focusing on avoiding seed oils, experts said, you\u2019d be better off spending that time and mental energy on avoiding fast and highly processed foods.",
      "\u201cFor years, we have told you to eat less sugar and salt and chips and junk food,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIf suddenly telling you that the seed oil in them is killing you [means] you stop eating all the crap for the wrong reason \u2014 I would be thrilled.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For 13 years, Josh Harris\u2019s ownership of the NBA\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers has been synonymous with \u201cThe Process\u201d \u2014 the nickname of the franchise\u2019s long, arduous rebuild that was supposed to transform it from maligned to a championship contender.",
      "That process has been far more accelerated with Harris\u2019s newest team. In only his second season since a Harris-led ownership group bought the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders for a record sale price of $6.05 billion, the Commanders have gone from owning the league\u2019s second-worst record in 2023 to playing this Sunday for the NFC championship, and a berth in the Super Bowl.",
      "Standing in the Commanders\u2019 path to the Super Bowl? A road game this Sunday in, yes, Philadelphia.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Harris\u2019s ownership ties have led to conflicts within Philadelphia. The Eagles and Commanders play in the same NFL division, and split this season\u2019s games at one win apiece. Harris also is part of the group that owns the NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils, which play in the same division as Philadelphia\u2019s Flyers (which, in turn, share the same arena as the Sixers). Since Harris took over, however, New Jersey and Philadelphia have not faced one another in hockey\u2019s postseason.",

      "Now, some of Sunday\u2019s spotlight onto why the private-equity billionaire\u2019s newest team has so quickly advanced deeper in the playoffs than the Sixers ever have in his decade-plus as owner. Some of it could be owed to the luck of the draft. The Commanders and Sixers each tried to rebuild around a top draft pick. But while center Joel Embiid, the No. 3 pick in the 2014 NBA draft, has struggled to stay healthy and deliver on huge expectations, Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, the No. 2 selection last spring, has coolly already won his first two road starts in the postseason. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio told reporters this week that Daniels is \u201cprobably\u201d the best rookie quarterback he has ever seen in a decades-long career in the NFL.",
      "But under a headline\u00a0reading, \u201cUnpopular Sixers owner Josh Harris and his Commanders are coming,\u201d Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes this week criticized Harris for overseeing \u201cthe worst trade in Philly history,\u201d questioned his personnel decisions leading the team and the handling of a recent campaign to build a new arena downtown, only to reverse course.",
      "A collision in the NFL playoffs would have seemed unthinkable when a Harris-controlled ownership group officially bought out Dan Snyder in 2023. In the past seven years, the Eagles had won one Super Bowl and advanced to another. Under Snyder, meanwhile, Washington suffered off-field black eyes \u2014 a 2022\u00a0investigation\u00a0by a House committee found \u201cthat sexual harassment, bullying, and other toxic conduct pervaded the Commanders workplace, perpetuated by a culture of fear instilled by the team\u2019s owner\u201d \u2014 and on-field woes, winning just two playoff games since Snyder\u2019s tenure began in 1999.",
      "Behind Daniels, the Commanders have equaled that franchise\u2019s number of playoff wins from the previous quarter-century in the last two weeks. One more win would send the Commanders to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1991.",
      "\u201cThis guy\u2019s Sixers teams have never made it out of the second round in increasingly humiliating fashion and now he\u2019s potentially going to the Super Bowl with a Philly rival?\u201d wrote Shamus Clancy\u00a0in the Philly Voice\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cBoos would rain down from Lincoln Financial Field like a biblical plague if there were to be a post-game ceremony on Sunday of Harris celebrating on stage with the TV broadcast crew.\u201d"

      "The\u00a0Patriots\u00a0signed Peppers, a safety in his third season with the team, to an extension over the summer. Peppers was originally drafted by Cleveland in 2017 and spent two seasons with the Browns before playing for the New York Giants for three seasons.",

    "story": [
      "Four men from Chile have been charged in an ongoing investigation of nationwide burglaries at the homes of the rich and sometimes famous, according to court documents.",
      "The four have been linked to a Dec. 9 burglary in Hamilton County, Ohio, authorities say in the filing, a time and place that coincide with a break-in at the home of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Though the documents did not name Burrow as a victim, a Bengals hat allegedly stolen during that December break-in was spotted by detectives in an SUV used by the suspects, the documents say.",
      "Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost announced that a grand jury returned an indictment against the four in court Tuesday. It includes charges of corrupt activity, participation in a criminal gang and possessing burglary tools, according to a statement. He credited the Southwest Ohio Burglary Task Force, which his office launched last year to investigate the break-ins.",
      "A spokesperson for Yost said the indictment was returned at a preliminary hearing at which the defendants did not enter pleas. Ohio criminal procedure does not require pleas to be entered for felony cases at such hearings.",
      "The original criminal complaint includes those charges, as well as obstructing investigators, according to the local case filed in Springfield municipal court on Jan. 13. Authorities alleged in the filing that three of the four presented fake identification to police.",
      "Investigators say an LSU football shirt believed to have been taken in the Dec. 9 burglary was also spotted in the Chevrolet SUV after Ohio State Police stopped it on Interstate 70 on Jan. 10 during an investigation of the burglaries, according to the initial filings. Burrow graduated from Louisiana State University, where he played his final two seasons of college football.",
      "A cellphone one of the four, Bastian Alejandro Morales, 23, was alleged to possess was determined to have been in the area of the Dec. 9 home burglary, and he was previously spotted in a Volkswagen SUV seen in the area of the burglary, investigators said in the Jan. 13 court documents.",
      "Burrow's home in Anderson Township had been ransacked on that date, the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office reported. At the time, Burrow was in Arlington, Texas, where he played in his team's win against the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Burrow's agent and the Bengals did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday night.",
      "In the fall, the NFL and the NBA, the latter citing FBI intelligence, warned professional athletes and their employers about what the NBA described as \u201ctransnational South American Theft Groups\u201d targeting \u201cprofessional athletes and other high-net-worth individuals.\u201d",
      "Since the start of 2024, athletes who have been victimized by residential break-ins include Burrow, Kansas City Chiefs stars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes, Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr., Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and the fianc\u00e9e of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.",
      "The stars' locations are often matters of public record, with even publicized home games indicating they're not really at home.",
      "The four suspects, arrested and booked into Clark County Jail, were identified as Morales; Sergio Andres Cabello, 38; Jordan Francisco Sanchez, 22; and Alejandro Esteban Huaiquil-Chavez, 24. The documents described all of them as Chileans who were alleged to have \"overstayed their permissions.\"",
      "They were initially detained for being in the country illegally, authorities said in the documents. All were in custody with no bail listed Tuesday evening, according to inmate records. All four have pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, court records show.",
      "It is not clear whether they have retained counsel. The public defender's office in Clark County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Todd Spitzer, the district attorney in Orange County, California, has blamed some of the crimes committed by Chileans on U.S. soil on the automated Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which clears visitors for 90-day passes under the Visa Waiver Program, granting citizens of 42 nations permission to enter and stay with relative ease.",
      "\u201cFor the last 18 months, I have been sounding the alarm about a dangerous loophole in the ESTA Visa Waiver program that is being exploited by organized crime rings from Chile to enter the United States unlimited times over a two-year period without background checks,\u201d Spitzer said last month.",
      "\"These criminals aren\u2019t coming to the United States to visit Disneyland,\" he said by email.",
      "Though investigators have not directly alleged the four Ohio defendants were involved in any of the nationwide burglaries that have victimized wealthy people, star athletes and some celebrities, the criminal complaint based on a narrative by Clark County Sheriff's Detective Brian Melchi said the suspects were targeted as part of \u201can ongoing investigation involving burglaries of multi-million dollar homes in multiple states.\"",
      "The Ohio State Highway Patrol traffic stop of the SUV carrying the defendants on Jan. 10 took place after they had stayed in a hotel in Fairfield, according to the criminal complaint, which made it clear they had been under surveillance.",
      "Inside the SUV, investigators said in court documents, was the smell of marijuana, as well as two Husky tools used to punch windows often found in the possession of South American burglars.",
      "The cellphone alleged to have been in Morales' possession and linked to the area of the Dec. 9 burglary came to the attention of investigators searching the Chevrolet Blazer when one of the detectives called a \"target\" number known to the investigation and the device alleged to belong to Morales lit up, according to the complaint.",
      "\"Investigators have arrested at least six different South American burglary groups, five of which were Chilean,\" the filing says.",
      "NBC affiliate WLWT of Cincinnati, which accessed the court documents, reported that, to its knowledge, Burrow\u2019s was the only multimillion-dollar home burglarized in Hamilton County on Dec. 9."

      "DENVER \u2014 Five elephants at a Colorado zoo may be \u201cmajestic\u201d but, since they\u2019re not human, they do not have the legal right to pursue their release, Colorado\u2019s highest court said Tuesday.",
      "The ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court follows a similar court defeat in New York in 2022 for an elephant named Happy at the Bronx Zoo in a case brought by an animal rights group. Rulings in favor of the animals would have allowed lawyers for both Happy and the elephants at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs \u2014 Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou and Jambo \u2014 to pursue a long-held legal process for prisoners to challenge their detention and possibly be sent to live in an elephant sanctuary instead.",
      "The Colorado court said its decision \u201cdoes not turn on our regard for these majestic animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, the legal question here boils down to whether an elephant is a person,\u201d the court said. \u201cAnd because an elephant is not a person, the elephants here do not have standing to bring a habeas corpus claim,\u201d it said in the ruling.",
      "The same animal rights group that tried to win Happy\u2019s release, the Nonhuman Rights Project, also brought the case in Colorado.",
      "The group argued that the Colorado elephants, born in the wild in Africa, have shown signs of brain damage because the zoo is essentially a prison for such intelligent and social creatures, known to roam for miles a day. It wanted the animals released to one of the two accredited elephant sanctuaries in the United States because the group thinks they can no longer live in the wild.",
      "The zoo argued moving the elephants and potentially placing them with new animals would be cruel at their age, possibly causing unnecessary stress. It said they aren\u2019t used to being in larger herds and, based on the zoo\u2019s observations, the elephants don\u2019t have the skills or desire to join one.",
      "While welcoming the Colorado court\u2019s ruling, the zoo said it was disappointed there had to be a legal fight over the issue and accused the Nonhuman Rights Project of \u201cabusing court systems\u201d to fundraise.",
      "\u201cIt seems their real goal is to manipulate people into donating to their cause by incessantly publicizing sensational court cases with relentless calls for supporters to donate,\u201d the zoo said in a statement.",
      "The Nonhuman Rights Project said the latest ruling \u201cperpetuates a clear injustice\u201d and predicted future courts would reject the idea that only humans have a right to liberty.",
      "\u201cAs with other social justice movements, early losses are expected as we challenge an entrenched status quo that has allowed Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou, and Jambo to be relegated to a lifetime of mental and physical suffering,\u201d it said in a statement."

      "The decision to rescind the sanctions came a day after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect, bringing a pause to Israel's 15-month military offensive in Gaza. After phase one of the deal began Sunday, three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian teenagers and women who were imprisoned or detained by Israel.",

      "Dimon did not get into the details of Trump\u2019s plans, but said it depends on how the duties are implemented. Trump has indicated the tariffs could take effect Feb. 1.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 14:34:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Many TikTok users \u2014 from Puerto Ricans to South Asians \u2014 have posted photos of their family in the two white, plastic chairs like the ones on the Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny's album cover.",
    "story": [
      "When Nicole Ortiz saw Bad Bunny's \"Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\" album cover for the first time, the Florida resident thought back to her visits to Puerto Rico and the huge parties where her relatives would play dominoes at the table and that feeling of love and togetherness.",
      "\u201cI see my grandmother in that chair playing dominoes with my uncle and dad,\u201d Ortiz, 48, told NBC News.",
      "Bad Bunny called his recent album, which translates to \u201cI should have taken more photos,\u201d his \u201cmost Puerto Rican\u201d album yet \u2014 and many fans agree.",
      "The cover, which features two plain white plastic chairs in a backyard full of bright green plants, has brought people smiles \u2014 and tears. The chairs, which are known as Monobloc chairs, are versatile and inexpensive chairs that can be found in countries all over the world, and they are used both indoors and outdoors.",
      "\u201cBoth my grandmothers have passed, and the chairs represent good times that involved Latin music, traditional foods and dancing,\" Ortiz said. \"It brings me sadness they aren\u2019t here but also brings me happiness that I have those memories.\u201d",
      "Bad Bunny's nostalgic message and iconic \u201cDtMF\u201d song have resonated with Latino and non-Latino fans, putting it at No. 1 on the TikTok\u2019s Top 50 list.",
      "Puerto Rican and other TikTok users have posted photos of their families in the two white chairs and see the album as an ode to their upbringing.",
      "A user posted a photo of her as a little girl with her grandmother on her birthday and said the cover immediately made her nostalgic. Another user said the chairs are where a lot of Latinos spend time with their families gossiping and talking about current events. She said she is who she is today because of the conversations in the white chairs.",
      "Bad Bunny's latest album is an homage and a love letter to the island and a call for Puerto Ricans to protect their culture. From his use of folkloric bomb and plena music to a short film showing the effects of gentrification in Puerto Rico, the album highlights the island\u2019s beauty and struggle.",
      "Uniting Puerto Ricans away from the island",
      "Dinatalia Farina, 29, said the album has made her rethink her idea of home. The album cover and its songs reminded Farina, 29, a Puerto Rican from New York, that home doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a physical place but instead can be a feeling full of nostalgia, rhythm and dance.",
      "\u201cWe are the reminders of home,\u201d Farina said. \u201cWe are the people that are going to continue these traditions that remind us of home.\u201d",
      "Ortiz, who lives in Florida, has struggled with her Puerto Rican identity her whole life. Although she has never lived in Puerto Rico, she was raised with the culture and feels connected to it in an emotional way. However, she would often think she wasn\u2019t \u201cPuerto Rican enough\u201d because of her separation from the island.",
      "When she saw the chairs on the album cover, she started to reminisce about the visits to Puerto Rico, from birthday parties in the backyard to eating food her grandmother cooked on the patio.",
      "The album reminded her it\u2019s OK not to live in Puerto Rico and still be Puerto Rican.",
      "\u201cAll of our traditions come from the island of Puerto Rico, and this album made me feel more connected to it,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI think it speaks to anyone who is connected to another culture.\u201d",
      "Crossing cultures, from Latin America to South Asia",
      "Erika Pradillo, 32, a Miami resident of Cuban and Spanish heritage, said that growing up she had a mini pink plastic chair where she used to do homework. Once she outgrew it, her grandmother would use it in the shower. She sees the album cover's chairs as a symbol of her roots. She sometimes feels like she's losing the connection to her culture, but the album helped remind her to always find her way back home.",
      "\u201cTo me, the empty chairs reflect how so many Latinos have become more and more removed from their roots,\u201d Pradillo said. \u201cWhat tethers so many of us to those roots in the first place are the people that sat in those chairs \u2014 our grandparents, our great aunts and uncles, our parents.\u201d",
      "Leila Haddaji, 25, of Morocco, shared a similar sentiment.",
      "\u201cIt reminds us of family gatherings, shared meals and moments of connection,\" Haddaji said. \"However, for many immigrants or those who have left their homelands, the empty chair becomes a poignant reminder of what was left behind \u2014 the home, the family or even a part of their identity.\u201d",
      "While many social media posts come from Latinos, South Asians in the diaspora have hopped on the trend, reminiscing about the places and loved ones they left behind.",
      "Though the album's songs are in Spanish, it\u2019s resonating with first- and second-generation South Asians, transcending language barriers with its message.",
      "South Asians are posting videos to the song's \u201cDtMF\u201d (the initials for the album's title) chorus, which translates to:\u00a0\"I should have taken more pictures of when I had you/I should have given you more kisses and hugs as many times as I could.\"",
      "A London-based creator who goes by Majestic Kay on TikTok said that she doesn\u2019t speak Spanish but that hearing the song reminded her of the six months she spent with family in India.",
      "\u201cThis trend but for missing home in India. Six months wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d she wrote in the caption.",
      "Noren Ahmad, 20, a Pakistani German creator, posted clips from her time in Pakistan to the catchy chorus.",
      "Even though Ahmad doesn\u2019t speak Spanish fluently, the song reminded her of Pakistan \u2014 which she visited for the first time in 10 years in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe song just feels like nostalgia,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m always going to be longing for Pakistan. My heart is always going to remember Pakistan. It\u2019s the one place where my heart feels at peace, where I feel like I don\u2019t have to change.\u201d",
      "In another montage to the song, Ahmad asks: \u201cWhat if our parents didn\u2019t have to leave?\u201d",
      "The song reminds Tahmina Begum, a Bangladeshi British user, of visiting Bangladesh and the feeling of not knowing when she\u2019ll see her loved ones there again.",
      "\u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has also helped people grieve their loved ones who have passed.",
      "Bad Bunny's message to take more photos of loved ones has hit home, with users starting a trend on social media posting memories of family members who are no longer in their lives. Bad Bunny reacted to the trend by posting a teary-eyed video on social media.",
      "Farina said that whenever she goes to Puerto Rico to visit her family, she is always the one with her camera out taking photos of them. She sees a reflection of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the photos of her grandparents, aunts and uncles and cousins.",
      "\u201cEvery time I visited Puerto Rico, I would cry because I didn\u2019t want to come back to New York,\u201d Farina said. \u201cI wanted to stay and move there. When I would come back, I noticed I would flip through my photos a lot. Home is not limited to just a place.\u201d",
      "Bad Bunny announced a residency for his sixth studio album in Puerto Rico this summer; he recently added shows, but they have all sold out.",
      "Farina hopes she can still attend the residency so she can see all of the music come to life onstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve cried so many times to this album; it\u2019s absolutely beautiful,\u201d Farina said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be Puerto Rican.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 13:54:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's pardon of more than 1,500 supporters charged in the Jan. 6 attack went further than what he suggested he would do just a month earlier.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pardon virtually every person charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was made at the last minute as the inauguration approached \u2014 and it surprised some of his supporters and aides.",
      "\u201cHe is who he is,\u201d a person who worked on Trump\u2019s transition team told NBC News. \u201cExpectations are sometimes set as best as can be expected, and sometimes they change quickly.\u201d",
      "Two officials who worked on Trump\u2019s transition said the decision to do a sweeping pardon was made just days before the inauguration.\u00a0They, like others interviewed for this article, were granted anonymity to share details of private discussions.",
      "Follow live politics updates here",
      "While Trump had long promised pardons for many, if not most, of those convicted of nonviolent crimes on Jan. 6, he had been less clear about how he would handle those found guilty of violent offenses, including 169 people who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers.",
      "Trump decided to go about as far as he could, issuing roughly 1,500 pardons and commuting the sentences for 14 others.",
      "The pardons surprised many in large part because Trump and Vice President JD Vance had signaled recently that the president would take a more surgical approach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what the staff work was like on that,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a Trump ally who attended Monday\u2019s inauguration, said in an interview.",
      "Drawing a line that would have denied pardons to people who attacked police \u201cis a more defensible position and easier to support,\u201d Gingrich added. \u201cYou have to wonder whether you really want to put people back on the street who haven\u2019t paid their dues for having done those things.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return requests for comment.",
      "Trump defended his decision at a news conference Tuesday evening. Asked by NBC News about his pardon of a man who plunged a stun gun into the neck of a police officer during the attack, Trump at first was unsure whether he had pardoned or commuted his sentence.",
      "When told it was a pardon, the president replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at everything. But I can say this, murderers today are not even charged. You have murders that aren\u2019t charged all over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese people have already served years in prison and they\u2019ve served them viciously,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting prison. It\u2019s been horrible. It\u2019s inhumane. It\u2019s been a terrible, terrible thing.\u201d",
      "Trump made freeing Jan. 6 participants a central campaign promise last year, referring to the prisoners as \u201chostages\u201d and playing a song at his rallies performed by inmates known as the J6 Choir. But Trump and his campaign team also at times promised nuance in how he would determine who would be eligible for pardons, indicating that violence could be a deal-breaker.",
      "In an interview in December with NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Trump reiterated that he wanted to do pardons on Day 1, but that there \u201cmay be some exceptions ... if somebody was radical, crazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to do case-by-case, and if they were nonviolent, I think they\u2019ve been greatly punished,\u201d Trump told Time magazine in an interview that month. \u201cAnd the answer is, I will be doing that, yeah, I\u2019m going to look if there\u2019s some that really were out of control.\u201d",
      "Vance was more direct in a Jan. 12 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d saying, \u201cIf you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn\u2019t be pardoned.\u201d On Tuesday, Vance's press secretary Taylor Van Kirk said the case-by-case basis that Trump and Vance had talked about \u201cmeant there was always going to be a large degree of gray area\u201d in how the pardons were executed.",
      "\u201cDue to the corrupt process of these prosecutions, President Trump rightly decided to grant a broad pardon to all wrongfully convicted of January 6 protesters,\u201d Van Kirk wrote to NBC News.",
      "Referring to former President Joe Biden\u2019s last-minute pardons before leaving office Monday, Van Kirk added that \u201cthe outgoing administration\u2019s application of presidential pardons for members of the Biden family are far more deserving of additional media scrutiny.\u201d",
      "A Republican close to the Trump administration who has spoken to Vance about the issue pointed to the vice president\u2019s long public stance in support of Jan. 6 defendants, noting that he helped raise money for them and their families as a Senate candidate in 2022.",
      "\u201cHis support for these people dates back at least two-and-a-half years,\u201d this person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything switched up. He\u2019s been pretty clear there\u2019s a gray area, but he\u2019s also always from the beginning been pushing for mass commutations.\u201d",
      "Once Trump\u2019s decision was made for \u201cleniency,\u201d one of the transition officials told NBC News, the entire nascent administration, including Vance, quickly got on the same page. Behind the scenes, Vance pushed for broad pardons and commutations, another person familiar with his role said.",
      "\u201cEveryone has been clear that we were looking at all the cases and the ultimate decision, which the Vice President ended up being a driving force behind, was more encompassing action,\u201d the second transition official wrote to NBC News. \u201cThe President ended up airing on leniency given how political and broken the process was.\u201d",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a GOP political consultant with close ties to Trump world who was subpoenaed to testify before the House\u2019s Jan. 6 committee, said there was little doubt Trump would take sweeping action early in his term.",
      "\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSome on the left may disagree, but the process was the punishment.\u201d",
      "The move was also overwhelmingly backed by Trump\u2019s MAGA political base, many of whom descended on Washington over the past few days for his inauguration.",
      "Brett Thomas, 52, said he had \u201ctears coming out of my eyes\u201d when he attended Trump\u2019s rally at Capital One Arena on Monday and heard the president say he would pardon the Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Thomas, the president of Rhino Web Studios in New Orleans, was at Capitol on Jan. 6, but did not go in because his wife called him and told him to go back to his hotel, he said.",
      "Although he supported Trump\u2019s decision, he said he does see a difference between people who walked into the Capitol and those who fought with the cops on that day. Still, he believes they all had been punished enough.",
      "\u201cIf there is proof that you assaulted a police officer, there needs to be consequences,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cNow if they have been sitting in jail for years, that\u2019s their consequence. And as far as I am concerned, time served.\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, a Trump ally and legal adviser who had publicly lobbied the president to go big on pardons, said Trump felt something of a kindred spirit with his supporters who were Jan. 6 prisoners because he had also been prosecuted by the government.",
      "\u201cTrump has been on the receiving end of Joe Biden\u2019s politicized and weaponized justice department,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Trump is a billionaire former and future president who had the resources to weather it. These Jan. 6th defendants do not.\u201d",
      "Davis also said that Biden\u2019s own pardons on his way out of office \u2014 which included members of his family \u2014 and his commuting the death sentences of 37 federal inmates on death row to life in prison, gave Trump the political cover he needed to use the pardon power as he saw fit.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden pardoned his family,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe freed child rapists and murderers from death row, and he pardoned a monster who murdered two FBI agents,\u201d Davis said, referring to Native American activist Leonard Peltier, who has long maintained his innocence and had his life sentence commuted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Democrats\u2019 fake tears about Trump\u2019s pardons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey can go to hell,\u201d he added.",
      "The Trump decision, though, is not without tense criticism. Michael Fanone, the former police officer who had a stun gun driven into his neck and was among those badly injured during the Jan. 6 attacks, told NBC News the pardons were \u201coutrageous\u201d but \u201cshouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to any American.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe rule of law is dead in this country. We are now in the age of government lawlessness,\u201d Fanone said.",
      "Fanone suffered a heart attack and traumatic brain injury as a result of the attack and was among the officers who testified before the House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 attack. Biden also issued pre-emptive pardons to committee members, which include current and former members of Congress, out of fear Trump would try to go after them when he returned to office.",
      "Current and former prosecutors also sharply criticized Trump\u2019s pardons, with one person who worked on the Jan. 6 cases calling them \u201cappalling.\u201d",
      "While some Republican lawmakers cheered Trump\u2019s actions, a number of Republican senators were less enthusiastic, outright saying they disagreed or simply refusing to embrace them.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t agree,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \u2014 who was photographed pumping his fist at Trump supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 said he would not have pardoned people who committed violent offenses but noted that Trump \u201ckeeps his campaign promises.\u201d"

      "She explained that he did not want to speak about the situation on camera, but she felt differently. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like it would be an authentic experience, or that I could continue the experience if we didn\u2019t,\u201d Adionser said.",
      "\u201c(I said) \u2018I do\u2019 to all of it,\u201d she told hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey. \u201cI was aware and I took on what I wanted to.\u201d",
      "Before the season aired, the former couple spoke to TODAY.com in separate interviews and gushed about their love story.",
      "\u201cIt was just a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt before in my life. From day one, it was Ashley. It was a feeling that I\u2019ve constantly kept feeling with her. It was just safe. It was warm. It felt like the most love I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d Francis said.",
      "Adionser acknowledged that she was skeptical during the process but felt that Francis was the right person for her.",
      "\u201cI think that I was just willing to take a risk and to lead with feelings over logic this time, which is not something I naturally do,\u201d she told TODAY.com \u201cAnd honestly, it\u2019s weird, because when you date in the pods, it doesn\u2019t feel like a crush. You feel deeply and madly in love in an insane amount of time.\u201d",
      "Adionser and Francis follow Season 2 couples Iyanna McNeely and Jarrette Jones and Danielle Ruhl and Nick Thompson as the only \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d pairs who have broken up after saying \u201cI do\u201d on the show."

      "Despite being mortal enemies, Xaden ends up training Violet. A rider will die if their dragon dies, and occasionally, a dragon can't recover after their rider's death. Tairn and Sgaeyl's mating bond also means they cannot be apart from each other for long, and if one dies, so does the other. Because of their mated dragons, Xaden now needs to keep Violet alive to keep himself alive.",

      "When they get there, Violet learns that Xaden has been secretly assisting gryphon riders from Poromiel, supplying them with weapons. It turns out, the reason they've been attacking Navarrian outposts is because they are under attack from venin, creatures Violet previously believed were only myth, and needed supplies.",
      "Learning that venin exist and that the gryphon fliers aren't the true enemy, Violet is forced to question her complacency and her mother's role in spreading propaganda.",

      "Xaden promises to help Violet build her mental shields so she can protect her mind from Dain and others with similar signets. As for their relationship, they still struggle with trust. With Xaden becoming the revolution's leader, he needs to keep some secrets, but Violet requests full disclosure if he wants to be together. They remain at an impasse for a while.",
      "Meanwhile, the other marked ones continue to smuggle weapons out of Basgiath to gryphon fliers. Violet, now a second-year, embarks on a research journey in the Archives, with the help of Jesinia, to figure out how Basgiath wards work so she can set up wards around Aretia.",

      "With the help of her friends, Violet figures out that the journals of the First Six are most likely in King Tauri's private vault, but they'll need someone from his bloodline to get in, so they rope Aaric into their plan.",
      "But before they can enact it, infantry cadets try to kill Violet. Surprisingly, Jack saves her, though it doesn't change her distrust of him.",
      "Violet and Xaden eventually break into the Archives for the journals and take two. However, Nolan, a healer who Violet has always trusted, deceives and drugs her. Varrish arrives, taking one of the journals with him.",
      "Violet is subjected to torture from Varrish, but she holds strong. In a final act to break her, Varrish calls in Dain and commands him read Violet's memories, which he does. After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",
      "Xaden uses the chaos of Basgiath to his advantage, addressing all the cadets and telling them the truth of what's happening beyond the wards. He gives them the option to stay at Basgiath and defend Navarre, or, come with him to fight for the whole Continent. Nearly half the quadrant decides to join.",
      "The group continues holding classes for the riders at Aretia as Violet tries to translate the journals and get the wards up and running. Soon, she thinks she's discovered the solution: blood magic.",
      "After her first attempt fails, Violet goes in search of a luminary. She visits Poromiel's leader, Viscount Tecarus, and learns that Xaden was offered a luminary in exchange for herself, a deal he refused.  After having to fight off another venin and agreeing to train gryphon fliers in Aretia, Xaden and Violet secure the luminary.",
      "Back at Aretia, Violet, Xaden and his ex-fianc\u00e9e, a gryphon flier named Cat, spar over their twisted romantic pasts. Xaden reveals he is technically heir to Tyrrendor, reassuring Violet that he and Cat were only ever together for a political alliances.",
      "But just as the pair starts to piece their relationship back together, it crumbles once more when Violet realizes that Xaden has a secret second signet, since Sgaeyl bonded Xaden and his grandfather before him.",
      "Violet demands he tell her what it is. He reveals he's inntinnsic, meaning he can read minds. Manifesting as an inntinnsic typically results in death in Navarre.",

      "General Melgren, General Lilith Sorrengail and some other members of leadership request a meeting with Violet, Xaden and Mira.",
      "Melgren tells them that he's seen an upcoming battle, claiming the venin will attack Samara and win. He asks them to help in the battle, but Brennan reveals himself, telling them no.",
      "Violet then realizes that the real battle won't be at Samara, but at Basgiath. Violet convinces Xaden that they have to fight for Basgiath, but Brennan refuses.",
      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber. It turns out, Jack survived Violet dropping a mountain on him because he turned venin. Jack kills his own dragon, which cracks the wardstone in half, knocking down the college's wards.",

      "They begin to assemble their forces, as Brennan arrives with more riders and fliers. Brennan tries to mend the wardstone as the battle above begins.",
      "One of the venin reveals that their goal is to take Violet alive. Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\"",
      "What will happen in 'Onyx Storm'?",
      "It's unclear where \"Onyx Storm\" will pick up after the events of \"Iron Flame.\"",
      "Yarros teased what the book will hold in an interview with Elle, revealing that \"fans can expect to see Violet with one singular motivation, which is to save Xaden.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to follow the implications of what\u2019s been revealed in\u00a0'Iron Flame,' and you\u2019re going to see Andarna very curious about where she comes from,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s the biggest thing I can tease before a publisher jumps out and tackles me to the floor.\"",
      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",
      "They need an army. They need power. They need\u00a0magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find\u2014the truth.",
      "But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath."

    "summary": "During a sit down with Drew Barrymore, Glenn Close revealed the alternative ending to the 1987 thriller \"Fatal Attraction.\"",
    "story": [
      "This story contains spoilers for the movie \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d",
      "Of her many notable roles, Glenn Close is probably best known for her portrayal of Alex Forrest in the 1987 thriller \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d",
      "The film features Close and Michael Douglas as two strangers who meet at a work event and begin an illicit affair that sours after Douglas\u2019 married character, Dan Gallagher, tries to break off their romance.",
      "Instead of going their separate ways, Close's character, Forrest, suffers a psychotic break and begins to stalk Gallagher, his wife and their young daughter. Forrest's behavior becomes increasingly more violent leading to the film's memorable ending.",
      "However, it was an ending that Close says wasn't originally scripted.",
      "\u201cThere was an original ending that didn't end up in the original film,\u201d Close revealed during a recent segment on \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show.\u201d",
      "Fans of the Oscar-nominated thriller may remember that throughout \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d Close's character becomes increasingly agitated over being spurned by Gallagher, leading to a climactic ending in which she breaks into the couple's home, boils the family pet rabbit in a pot, then attempts to kill her former lover with a butcher knife.",
      "In the end, Gallagher and Forrest battle it out in the bathroom before Forrest is ultimately shot to death by his wife, Beth (played by Anne Archer).",
      "However, according to Close, that ending was much different than was was in the script with Forrest, an ardent fan of \u201cMadame Butterfly,\u201d emulating the opera's tragic ending the film's original finale.",
      "\u201cIn the original ending (Forrest and Gallagher) have that terrible fight and then she takes that same knife and as \u2018Madam Butterfly\u2019 is playing, she cuts her throat and she dies,\u201d Close told Barrymore, who audibly gasped out loud.",
      "\u201cDid they shoot that scene?\u201d asked Barrymore. \u201cThey did shoot that scene,\u201d Close replied.",
      "But according to Close, that alternate ending never made it to theaters because test audiences hated it. Specifically, they hated Close's character.",
      "\u201cThe audience hated (Forrest) so much for coming between that perfect little family, even though (Gallagher) cheated on his beautiful wife, that they felt she needed to be punished even more, so they came back and told me that they're going to re-shoot it,\u201d said Close.",
      "The decision surprised Close, who says she did research and interviews ahead of the role, determining that she \u201cwould have done herself in before she would have killed, she was not a psychopath,\u201d explained Close.",
      "In fact, upon learning of the film's new ending, Close says she refused to do it, but changed her mind after a meeting with the film's director, Adrian Lyne, producers and Michael Douglas.",
      "\u201cI was saying, \u2018What if it was you? What if it was your character? What did you do?\u2019 Like, I was so furious,\u201d she said.",
      "The decision to re-shoot led to an Oscar-nomination for Close, as well as five others for the film in 1988, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Archer and a Best Director nod for Lyne."

The prince received a \u201cfull apology\u201d but fell short of his mission to hold British tabloids accountable in open court.",
      "The Duke of Sussex\u2019s decision to settle his claims against News Group Newspapers (NGN) ends his efforts expose the misdeeds of the publisher of The Sun and long-shuttered News of the World in open trial.",
      "Along with former lawmaker Tom Watson, Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, had sued NGN over alleged unlawful activities carried out by journalists and private investigators working for the newspapers.",
      "The group, which had long denied the allegations, offered what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Harry \u201cfor the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life.\u201d",
      "In the British civil court system, a settlement often involves the accused covering the claimant's legal fees, as well as handing over an additional cash payment.",
      "NGN said it was sorry for intruding into the private life of Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales and apologized to Harry \u201cfor the phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators instructed by them at the News of the World.\u201d",
      "Outside the London court where the trial had been due to take place, David Sherborne \u2014 the lawyer representing Harry and Watson \u2014 read out a statement on their behalf.",
      "\u201cAfter endless resistance, denials and legal battles by News Group Newspapers, including spending more than a billion pounds in payouts and in legal costs (as well as paying-off those in the know) to prevent the full picture from coming out, News UK [NGN\u2019s parent company] is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Sherborne\u2019s statement added that \u201cPrince Harry and his immediate family have also had to repeatedly withstand aggressive and vengeful coverage since starting his claim over five years ago,\u201d which   he said had left them concerned for their safety.",
      "\u201cToday the lies are laid bare. Today, the cover-ups are exposed. And today proves that no one stands above the law,\u201d he said.",
      "Harry first brought the lawsuit against NGN in 2019 and the eight-week trial was supposed to start Tuesday. He had been expected to testify for several days next month.",
      "But in a surprising twist \u2014 one that angered Judge Timothy Fancourt \u2014 both sides on Tuesday asked for more time to thrash out a deal.\u00a0When Fancourt refused to allow a further delay until Wednesday, attorneys on both sides said they would go to the Court of Appeal to challenge his ruling, stalling the start of the trial.",
      "Ahead of the trial, Sherborne alleged the newspapers had used deception to obtain his clients' medical, phone and flight records, as well as bugging homes and placing listening devices into cars.\u00a0He also alleged that executives destroyed documents and used other methods to conceal the chicanery.",
      "NGN also issued what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Watson \u201cfor the unwarranted intrusion carried out into his private life during his time in Government by the News of the World during the period 2009-2011.\u201d",
      "When serving as a member of Parliament, Watson played a significant role in the initial inquiry into alleged phone-hacking by members of the British newspaper media. He also wrote a book charting the relationship between Murdoch-owned titles and politicians.",
      "NGN's apology said Watson had been \u201cplaced under surveillance in 2009 by journalists at the News of the World and those instructed by them.\u201d The former deputy leader of the Labour Party, it added, had also been awarded \u201csubstantial damages.\u201d",
      "Harry, meanwhile, began positioning himself at odds with the royal family\u2019s famous \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d attitude on the matter two years ago. He became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, did so in the late 19th century.",
      "Harry revealed in court papers that his father opposed his litigation, but although other claimants including celebrities, sports stars and politicians settled cases with NGN, he had always said his mission was not to receive money but to get to the truth.",
      "NGN has already paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World but it has always denied there was wrongdoing at The Sun. It has also rejected allegations that senior figures knew about the activity or tried to cover it up.",
      "In a separate statement released as well as the apology, a spokesperson for NGN said the apology was \u201cfor incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, not by journalists, during the period 1996-2011.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now.\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "The spokesperson also denied that Watson\u2019s phone was hacked. \u201cHad this gone to trial, NGN would have called evidence from telecoms experts to demonstrate that hacking after 2007 was nigh on impossible due to security upgrades undertaken by telecoms companies,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Even if he had gone to trial and won, Harry could still have been on the hook for a multimillion-pound legal bill. Under English civil law, a claimant who wins a court judgment that is lower than what they were offered to settle, has to pay the legal bills for both sides. The law is designed to discourage lengthy trials.",
      "Actor Hugh Grant had been a claimant with Harry, but said in April that he was forced to accept \u201can enormous amount of money\u201d to settle his case as he could have otherwise faced a large legal bill."

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hours after President Donald Trump rescinded American sanctions on far-right settler groups and individuals accused of involvement in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Israel\u2019s military said it had launched a \u201csignificant\u201d operation in the territory.",
      "Israeli forces moved into the northern city of Jenin in an offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was launched to \u201cdefeat terrorism.\u201d Health authorities in the region said at least seven people were killed and dozens injured.",

      "Introduced by the Biden administration in February, Executive Order 14115 saw sanctions imposed on \u201cpersons undermining peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.\u201d",
      "But in a major policy reversal, the White House website said Monday that Trump\u00a0had done away with the measures, which barred Americans from dealing with both Israeli settlers and entities associated with them while freezing their U.S. assets.",
      "It came after Trump described Gaza as a \u201cphenomenal location\u201d as he signed a series of executive orders in the Oval Office, shortly after his presidential inauguration ceremony.",
      "The decision to rescind the sanctions came a day after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect, bringing a pause to Israel's 15-month military offensive in Gaza. After phase one of the deal began Sunday, three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian teenagers and women who were imprisoned or detained by Israel.",
      "During his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held U.S. position that the settlements are illegal before it was restored by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump's reversal was welcomed by ultranationalist Israeli politicians including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from his role as justice minister after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government voted to accept the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Calling the sanctions \u201cblatant foreign interference in the internal affairs of the State of Israel,\u201d Smotrich said Tuesday in a post on X, that they had \u201charmed\u201d relations between the United States and Israel. Ben-Gvir also took to X where he praised the \u201crighting of an injustice.\u201d",
      "Much of the world's attention has focused on the Gaza Strip during the 15 months of conflict, which began Oct. 7, 2023, when Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage in Hamas' multipronged attacks on Israel, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave, though researchers have estimated that the death toll could be significantly higher.",

      "In the year leading up to the Hamas attacks, 33 Israelis were killed in the West Bank, the database shows. Between that date and Jan. 6, the last date it was updated, it shows that 28 have been killed.",
      "Within hours of Monday's announcement from the White House, the  Israeli military said in a statement that dozens of \u201cIsraeli civilians,\u201d some of them masked, raided the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq. There, they \u201cinstigated riots, set property on fire and caused damage,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Troops were dispatched to the scene where they were attacked by Israelis, some of whom threw rocks, the statement added.",
      "A joint investigation into the incident had been opened by the Department of Internal Police Investigations and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division, the statement said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether any of those involved were arrested and charged, the IDF referred NBC News to the Israel Police. The police force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Palestinian health officials said in a statement that at least seven people were killed and around 35 injured as a result of the operation.",
      "Referring to the region as Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the West Bank, Smotrich said in a separate statement that the operation would help to \u201cchange the security perception\u201d about the region.",
      "The operation was launched after the United Nations Human Rights Office said in a statement Monday that it was \u201calarmed by a wave of renewed violence perpetrated by settlers and Israeli security forces in the Occupied West Bank.\u201d",

Israel meanwhile launched a large operation in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six people, according to Palestinian officials.",
      "Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi is the most senior Israeli figure to resign over the security breakdown on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants\u00a0carried out a land, sea and air assault\u00a0into southern Israel, rampaging through army bases and nearby communities for hours.",
      "The attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and the militants abducted another 250. More than 90 captives are still being held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Halevi\u2019s resignation came just days into a fragile ceasefire with Hamas that could lead to an end to the war and the return of the remaining captives. Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, head of Israel\u2019s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Gaza, also tendered his resignation.",
      "The resignation of the two senior generals will likely add to calls for a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 failures, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 whose leadership could be implicated \u2014 has said must wait until the war is over.",
      "Halevi had also appeared to be at odds with Israel\u2019s new defense minister, Israel Katz, over the direction of the war, with Halevi saying Israel had accomplished most of its goals and Katz echoing Netanyahu\u2019s vow to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas.",

      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek an independent state encompassing all three territories.",
      "The ceasefire with Hamas does not apply to the West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war. Israeli troops have carried out\u00a0near-daily raids that often ignite gunbattles.",
      "There has also been a rise in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists \u2014 including a rampage in two Palestinian villages overnight Monday \u2014 as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.",
      "Hamas condemned the Israeli operation in Jenin, calling on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to step up their own attacks.",
      "The smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad militant group also condemned the operation, saying it reflected Israel\u2019s \u201cfailure to achieve its goals in Gaza.\u201d It said it was also a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d by Netanyahu to save his governing coalition.",
      "Netanyahu has faced criticism from his far-right allies over the ceasefire, which required Israeli troops to pull back from populated areas in Gaza and envisions the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis.",
      "The ceasefire is supposed to last for six weeks and see 33 militant-held\u00a0hostages\u00a0released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\u00a0Three hostages and 90 prisoners\u00a0were released on Sunday, when it took effect.",
      "The truce has already seen\u00a0Hamas return to the streets, showing that it remains in firm control of the territory despite 15 months of war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and\u00a0caused widespread devastation.",
      "One of Netanyahu\u2019s erstwhile partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir,\u00a0quit the government\u00a0the day the ceasefire went into effect, weakening the coalition but still leaving Netanyahu with a parliamentary majority. Another, far-right leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire ends in six weeks.",

      "Unlike four years ago, when his term began in a flurry of unpreparedness, this time Trump let fly with a series of actions and statements that seek to scrub many of former President Joe Biden\u2019s decisions and replace them with Trump's own stark imprimatur.",
      "From tariffs, TikTok and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here are the headlines of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves during the first 24 hours of a term set to last 1,461 days \u2014 and how the world reacted.",
      "Russia",
      "The president previously claimed he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. \u201cThis is only half a day. I have another half a day left,\u201d he said Monday.",
      "That idea sparked alarm in Europe, which worries that Trump could force Ukraine into a negotiation that favors Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has more recently stretched this timeline to as long as six months, which some have taken as a signal of support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to criticize Putin \u2014 one of the authoritarian leaders he has spoken warmly about in the past, saying he is \u201cnot doing so well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not making him look very good,\u201d Trump said of how the war is going for Putin, adding that he was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d",
      "When asked Tuesday about Trump\u2019s comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \u201cwe respect the choice of the American people\u201d and that \u201cTrump has also repeatedly given reason to say that they also respect the choice of the Russian people.\u201d",

The 2020 Abraham Accords, establishing relations between Israel and several Middle Eastern and North African countries, was perhaps the first Trump administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement.",

      "U.S. officials have long refrained from using the phrase as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea \u201ccan never be recognized\u201d as such.",

      "China",
      "While campaigning in 2024, Trump suggested he could slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, risking a rerun of the Beijing trade war he fought during his first term.",
      "Now he suggests these tariffs could be used to force through a deal in which the U.S. acquires half of the social media platform TikTok.

      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",
      "As expected, one of Trump\u2019s first executive orders was to leave the 2016 Paris climate change accord, in which countries agreed to limit post-industrial temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "This will put the United States alongside Yemen, Iran and Libya as nonsignatories to the deal, which Trump said was a \u201crip-off\u201d but experts say is still humanity\u2019s best hope at limiting catastrophe.",

      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",

      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",

      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",

      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",

      "The Asian country has recorded the world\u2019s lowest fertility rates, but the number of newborns from January 2024 to November 2024 rose 3% from a year earlier to 220,094, monthly government data showed Wednesday.",
      "In 2023, the number of newborns fell 7.7%, extending declines to an eighth consecutive year and resulting in an annual fertility rate of\u00a00.72, the lowest globally.",
      "The rise comes as\u00a0marriages\u00a0rose in 2023,\u00a0marking the first increase in 12 years after couples had postponed weddings during the pandemic.",
      "In South Korea, there is a high correlation between marriages and\u00a0births, with a time lag of one or two years, as marriage is often seen as a prerequisite to having children.",
      "In a government survey last year, 62.8% of\u00a0South\u00a0Koreans opposed\u00a0births outside marriage, though that was down from 77.5% a decade ago.",
      "In neighboring\u00a0China, the number of\u00a0births rose 5.8% to 9.54 million in 2024, also boosted by delays in marriages due to the pandemic.",
      "The number of marriages in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0in the January-to-November period jumped 13.5%, to 199,903. That figure, unless there is a change in December, will mark the biggest annual increase since 1980.",
      "Last year,\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0rolled out various\u00a0measures\u00a0to encourage young people to get married and have children, after now impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol declared a \u201cnational demographic crisis\u201d and a plan to create a new ministry devoted to tackling low\u00a0birth\u00a0rates.",
      "Most of the measures consisted of financial support through tax cuts and subsidies, namely a one-time tax cut of 500,000 won ($349.35) per person for couples married between 2024 and 2026, though the government has said it will try to take a more comprehensive approach.",
      "The annual data for 2024 is due to be released on Feb. 26."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A Maine coon cat named Mittens became an accidental jetsetter this month when her cage was overlooked in a plane cargo hold and she made three trips in 24 hours between New Zealand and Australia.",
      "Mittens, 8, was booked for one-way travel with her family from Christchurch, New Zealand, to their new home in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 13. But owner Margo Neas said Wednesday that as she waited for Mittens to be unloaded from the plane\u2019s freight area, three hours passed with no sign of the cat.",
      "It was then that ground staff told Neas the plane had returned to New Zealand \u2014 with Mittens still on board. The return trip involves about 7.5 hours in the air.",
      "\u201cI said, how can this happen? How can this happen? Oh my God,\u201d Neas said.",
      "The Air New Zealand pilot was told of the extra passenger during the flight and turned on the heating in the cargo hold to keep Mittens comfortable, she added. Neas was told that a stowed wheelchair had obscured a baggage handler\u2019s view of Mittens\u2019 cage.",
      "\u201cIt was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn\u2019t have the family, we weren\u2019t complete,\u201d she said.",
      "But the saga had a happy ending. The pet moving company that Neas used to arrange Mittens\u2019 travel met the cat on her return to Christchurch and ensured she was back on the plane for another trip to Melbourne \u2014 this time just one way.",
      "Mittens had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed.",

      "The government led by the Pheu Thai party made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok\u2019s busiest commercial districts.",
      "Last week, Government House invited dozens of LGBTQ couples and activists for a photo op and a meeting with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and several high ranking officials to celebrate the law coming into effect, making Thailand the first in Southeast Asia and the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to legalize same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cIt is almost like a dream, but it\u2019s not. So, congratulations to all,\u201d Paetongtarn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that the world notice us, and know that in this small country we have this kind of thought. We have this kind of support for our people. So, we all should be proud.\u201d",
      "The organizers of Bangkok Pride have collaborated with relevant government agencies to hold a grand celebration in central Bangkok and facilitate couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day. They said that more than 300 couples have registered to officially tie the knot on Thursday at the event.",
      "\u201c(The law) is about returning our dignity, and confirming that we also have dignity as a human being,\u201d said Ann \u201cWaaddao\u201d Chumaporn, a gender equality activist and the lead organizer of Bangkok Pride. \u201cThat day is going to be meaningful to all the couples that have gone through this journey together. I\u2019d like to thank everyone, every love, that has faithfully struggled so that today would finally happen.\u201d",
      "How the law will be implemented",
      "The government and state agencies in Thailand are historically traditional in outlook. To prepare them for change, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said that it has organized workshops for staff of all Bangkok district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration. They included lectures raising awareness about gender diversity and guidance on how to properly communicate with those who come for the service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a missing piece of the jigsaw,\u201d Bangkok Deputy Gov. Sanon Wangsrangboon said at one of the workshops earlier this month. \u201cSociety is ready. The law is getting ready. But the last piece of the jigsaw is the understanding from officials.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged there that would be problems in the beginning, but said that he hoped they would gradually improve over time.",
      "After they register their marriage, Sunma said that she\u2019s looking forward to having a \u201creal marriage celebration\u201d with her and Danaya\u2019s families.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the two of us that are happy, but both of our families feel it is a big deal, and it is what everyone has been waiting for. Everyone said they are waiting for Jan. 23,\u201d she said."

      "They argued that the opposition\u2019s actions had paralyzed government and pushed the country\u2019s democratic and constitutional order to the brink of collapse.",
      "\u201cThe decree was intended simply to establish the format of martial law and never intended to be executed, nor was it possible to execute it because of the potential for conflict with higher-level laws,\u201d lawyer Cha Gi-hwan told the\u00a0court.",
