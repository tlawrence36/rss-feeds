      "Prince Harry has apologized to Canadians for wearing an LA Dodgers cap at a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prince Harry went to Toronto for events marking the end of World War I and found himself on an apology tour for offending Canadians.",
      "Speaking to a military charity on Thursday night, the Duke of Sussex sought to once again address the \u201cblue-hatted elephant in the room.\u201d He was referring to his widely ridiculed choice to wear a Los Angeles Dodgers cap at a World Series game in Los Angeles against the Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "It was seen as a major snub in Canada, a British Commonwealth nation, where his father, King Charles III, is the head of state. He was blasted on social media in the Great White North.",
      "Harry apologized for the blunder and tried to put a humorous spin on the incident he referred to as \u201cHat Gate.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re missing a lot of hair on top, and you\u2019re sitting under floodlights, you\u2019ll take any hat that\u2019s available,\u201d he joked in an interview with Canadian broadcaster CTV.",
      "He then donned a Blue Jays cap that happened to be an arm\u2019s length away.",
      "The incident was perceived by some as a test of his allegiance between his birthplace and his adopted home in the U.S. The prince and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties in 2020 and moved to Canada briefly before settling in California.",
      "The appearance of Harry and Meghan at Game 4 of the series \u2014 that LA went on to win in seven games \u2014 also rankled some Dodgers fans who were upset at their prime position behind home plate.",
      "The couple sat in the first row \u2013 in front of LA royalty -- Dodgers great Sandy Koufax and LA Laker star Magic Johnson, who is a part owner of the team.",

      "He felt \u201cunder duress\u201d and wore the hat as a polite gesture, something he told the Toronto audience that he thought Canadians \u2014 known for their civility \u2014 would support.",
      "Harry was in Canada for two days of events and meetings in advance of Remembrance Day on Tuesday that honors armed forces members who died in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cI am truly sorry for wearing a Dodgers cap,\u201d he said to applause at a dinner for the True Patriot Love Foundation, a charity for Canadian service members and veterans.",

      "\u201cHopefully you can forgive her as a native Californian for her Dodger\u2019s loyalty, even if for just one evening,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all jokes aside, this city has always meant a great deal to me \u2014 you provided me a wife.\u201d",
      "Harry insisted that he was rooting for the Jays for the final three games of the series \u2014 an admission that he told CTV might make his return to LA more difficult.",

      "Thieves made away with eight objects on display at the Paris museum, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense. They forced their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift, using disc cutters to cut through display cases and steal the jewels.",
      "Only Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s imperial crown, with more than 1,300 diamonds, was recovered on the day of the robbery outside the museum.",
      "Des Cars said the crown was likely damaged when it was removed from its display case through a \u201csmall cut\u201d made by the disc cutter, rather than when it fell down on the ground.",
      "\u201cAll of the most important pieces, the diamonds and emeralds, are actually still there,\u201d she said in an interview with the France Info news broadcaster. \"A few small pieces of diamonds are missing, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cone of the eight gold eagles on the crown is missing.\u201d",

      "Des Cars said she pushed for modernizing the museum soon after she was was named its head in 2021. Problems she listed include \u201cthe obsolescence of our technical facilities, the dilapidation of the building, structural issues related to welcoming visitors and overcrowding in the pyramid, which was designed for four million visitors but now welcomes nine million, and the problem with the display of the Mona Lisa, which is very unsatisfactory.\u201d",
      "Her comments come a day after France's court of auditors urged the Louvre to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority. The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period and conducted before the robbery, said the museum\u2019s investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations,\u201d such as buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience, rather than security.",

      "Lea Michele returns to Broadway's Imperial Theatre, where she first heard a song from \u201cChess\u201d as a child",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",
      "She remembers exactly where she sat the first time she saw \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d \u2014 orchestra left, six rows in \u2014 hearing Paige O\u2019Hara as Fantine sing \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in the musical that she would soon join, playing Young Cosette and Young Eponine.",
      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",
      "\u201cChess,\u201d which opens Nov. 16 and is set primarily in Bangkok and Budapest during the Cold War, tells the fictional story about two chess grandmasters \u2014 an American played by Aaron Tveit and a Soviet, portrayed by Nicholas Christopher \u2014 facing off to win for their respective nations, a task complicated by the appearance of a woman they both love, played by Michele.",
      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",
      "The musical, first staged in London in 1986 and heavily revised for a Broadway production in 1988, has a cult fan base, but the Broadway production was a flop, lasting less than 90 performances. Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

    "story": [
      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The 2026 Grammy Award nominations are almost here. And the competition will be stiff.",
      "Nominees will be announced during a video livestream on the Grammy website and the Recording Academy\u2019s YouTube channel on Friday at 8 a.m. Pacific and 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "A host of talent is on deck to announce the nominees, including Gayle King, Doechii, Karol G, Lizzo, Mumford & Sons, Nicole Scherzinger, Sabrina Carpenter, Sam Smith, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Brandi Carlile, CeCe Winans, David Foster, Jon Batiste, Little Big Town, Masaki Koike and last year's best new artist winner, Chappell Roan.",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Aug. 31, 2024 through Aug. 30, 2025 are eligible for nominations, so don\u2019t expect to see Taylor Swift's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d included. But do expect to see Carpenter's \u201cMan's Best Friend\u201d among the nominees; it was released just under the wire on August 29.",
      "That might have a little something to do with the new addition of a stand-alone category for best album cover. Carpenter sparked considerable discourse when its artwork was revealed; it shows the pop star kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair.",
      "There are plenty of unknowns going into the nomination announcements, too. The most obvious contenders for album of the year did not release new full-lengths within the eligibility window \u2014 artists like Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele. But there have been a few heavy hitters, like Kendrick Lamar's \u201cGNX,\" Lady Gaga's \u201cMayhem\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d If any of them took home the top prize, it would be for the first time.",

      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "Joachim Trier's \u201cSentimental Value\" builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life",
      "NEW YORK -- Joachim Trier, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Renate Reinsve have gathered in a backstage room at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall. A screen on the wall shows the crowd inside, raptly watching their film, \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d They have all consciously sat facing away from the movie.",
      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

      "REINSVE: Before I worked with Joachim, I played a lot of characters that keep their emotions really inside and aren\u2019t able to let them out. Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to. Joachim sits there and knows what the actor wants to do and he says, \u201cLet yourself do it.\u201d It feels like we\u2019re doing it together.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019ve always seen acting as a way of being able to do what you can\u2019t do in your private life. I\u2019m pretty reserved, in a way. I am!",
      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",
      "SKARSGARD: But it\u2019s fantastic to have this art where you can also test everything. Can I feel that? Wow! Yeah! It\u2019s like a child playing in a sandbox. It\u2019s the same mechanism. They play other people from day one. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionary: mimicking the adults to survive.",
      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort. They sing a strange, sensual love song in a band and they\u2019re shy that their parents will hear it. Or you write a book that\u2019s transgressive. I'm the opposite. I\u2019m rather proud that I've done personal films because my kids will see them. Maybe they\u2019ll see them and think they\u2019re stupid or my opinions are weird. That\u2019s OK, but they were me. I think this film came out of a climate in my life when I was thinking about these things.",
      "TRIER: That was when I knew I had the film I wanted to make, when I had the idea of ending. We were all nervous about it. The last day of the shoot. I\u2019m so proud of you two. My dream came true.",

      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

      "___",
      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",
      "His death echoed the suicide of G\u00f6ring, who 12 years earlier had taken a cyanide pill he\u2019d hidden in his cell. G\u00f6ring\u2019s life ended in secret, Kelley\u2019s in front of his family. After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "During a recent interview with The Associated Press, El-Hai spoke of Kelley's findings, the parallels between Kelley and G\u00f6ring and why he believes the story resonates now. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual. I know movies are a different medium from books and that what makes a book good is not the same as what makes a movie good. And so what we\u2019ve ended up with in \u201cNuremberg,\u201d I think, is a movie that is mostly factual, and more important, delivers the messages that are very close to the messages in my book.",
      "Douglas Kelley\u2019s message was that Nazism, fascism, or whatever you want to call it, has always had the potential for coming alive in our country. He saw it immediately when he came back from Europe, and it\u2019s certainly easier to find now.",

      "The seventh \u201cPredator\u201d film takes the franchise to new places by sticking its two stars together",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a long-established cinema subgenre: two opposed people reluctantly stuck together with a common purpose.",
      "The film, the seventh in the franchise (not counting the \u201cAlien vs. Predator\u201d offshoots), has the buddy comedy energy that comes with that dynamic. It also belongs to the narrower subgenre of people quite literally stuck together, like 1958's \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis were fugitives united by chains.",
      "And, in a scenario that provided special challenges for stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a still narrower subset it may share only with \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d: movies with a broken android worn like a backpack by a tall and powerful creature as they face peril in a strange corner of space.",
      "\u201cThe real physical inspiration for it was C-3PO strapped to Chewbacca\u2019s back,\u201d director Dan Trachtenberg told The Associated Press in an interview where he was joined by the film's two stars. \u201cBut I think the fun of this is that it\u2019s not Chewbacca. It\u2019s not a friendly, well-intentioned creature, it\u2019s a Predator.\u201d",
      "The apt working title of the movie, which will be released Friday by 20th Century Studios, was \u201cBackpack.\u201d",
      "For much of the New Zealand shoot, Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi were every bit as close as they appear to be in the film, where the top half of her artificially intelligent character, Thia, was back-to-back with Schuster-Koloamatangi's young Predator, Dek, who is out to prove himself on a hunt against a seemingly unkillable megamonster.",
      "\u201cHis Predator braids would, like, whip me in the face all the time in our action sequences,\u201d Fanning said with a laugh.",

      "The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday. It\u2019s as good a reason as any to take a beat and examine how the institution makes it decisions. Who selects the nominees? Who votes? Can anyone nominate any recorded release for a Grammy?",
      "We\u2019ve got you covered. Read on to get a crash course on how Grammy voting works.",
      "Members of the Recording Academy and record labels submit artists in certain categories, which are then vetted for eligibility. Currently, there are 95 Grammy Award categories.",
      "After submissions have been screened, voting members help determine who the final nominations will be \u2014 typically in the fall \u2014 using a membership dashboard. They can only vote for music that has been submitted and vetted.",
      "Once the nominees are determined and announced in November, a period of final round voting takes place. This cycle, that runs from Dec. 12 through Jan. 5.",
      "Winners are announced live at the award show in February.",
      "And don\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 voting members do not vote in all 95 categories. They\u2019re permitted to vote in up to 10 categories across three genre fields, as well as the six general field categories, which include record, album, song, producer, non-classical and songwriter, non-classical of the year, and best new artist. That allows experts to focus on their expertise.",
      "There are three types of Recording Academy memberships: Grammy U, professional and voting memberships. The latter includes performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists and beyond. Those are the members who determine Grammy winners each year.",
      "Voting members have to provide a proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations and certain verifiable credits.",

      "Nov 5, 8:19 AM",
      "But there are a few ways around some of those requirements: If you are a current year\u2019s Grammy winner or nominee, you do not need to provide a recommendation from someone in the industry. If you\u2019ve been nominated for a Grammy in the last five years, you do not need to provide proof of your credits.",
      "Entries must adhere to the specific qualifications of the categories they are submitted into. Rules and guidelines can be found at Grammy.com.",
      "There are also frequent changes made to categories and fields. In 2026, there have been a few: best country album has been divided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories have also been combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.",
      "Most importantly: Recordings and music videos must also be submitted within the Grammy eligibility window, which for the 2026 award show means work released between Aug. 31, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2025.",
      "The category of new artist is constantly evolving, trying to capture the zeitgeist each year as the process of categorizing fame gets more complicated. The Grammy rules currently say nominations hinge on whether \u201cthe artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence\u201d \u2014 and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Eligible artists must have released at least five singles or one album, but there is no longer a maximum. That\u2019s why someone like, say, Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 who broke out in the summer of \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 found herself up for the best new artist trophy in 2025 despite being on her sixth full-length release.",
      "And this year, the category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations announced on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CBS and can be streamed on demand via Paramount+.",

      "He said it is \u201ca remarkable, addictive book. Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights.",
      "\u201cThere are places it\u2019s toe-curlingly embarrassing. She puts it all out there,\u201d Millen said, adding that Garner ranks alongside those of Virginia Woolf in the canon of great literary diarists.",

Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women\u2019s vulnerability.",
      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",

      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad life, it\u2019s just a bad day,\u201d she tells herself to get through.",
      "Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.",
      "\u201cThese are my babies,\u201d said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan\u2019s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.",
      "Kwong is performing something so tricky it's not done in many laboratories: He's growing batches of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most common white blood cells.",
      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

      "In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning \u2014 Cassiano is one \u2014 can't always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor's, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.",

Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",

      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",

But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage. According to the organ network, 4,572 people received a heart transplant last year. That number of has grown gradually since Cheney's \u2014 there were 2,378 transplants in 2012.

      "Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email.

      "Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.",

      "The justices on Brazil's Supreme Court panel have unanimously rejected former President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal",
      "SAO PAULO -- The justices on Brazil's Supreme Court panel reviewing former President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal unanimously rejected his request on Friday.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the case\u2019s rapporteur, rejected all defense arguments, calling them \u201cunfeasible,\u201d and said there were no omissions in the sentencing. He was later followed by Justices Fl\u00e1vio Dino, Cristiano Zanin and C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia.",
      "The panel has until Nov. 14 to submit their votes, and the decision won't be finalized until then. Although unlikely, justices could change their votes before then.",
      "Bolsonaro was convicted in September of attempting a coup following his 2022 electoral defeat and was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison. He has been under house arrest since August.",
      "His legal team filed an appeal on Oct. 28 seeking to reduce the sentence. The defense argued that Bolsonaro should not be convicted of both organizing a coup and attempting to violently abolish democracy, claiming the charges overlap and that cumulative penalties are unjust.",
      "Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing. He was convicted of attempting a coup after losing the 2022 race to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in a plot that prosecutors alleged included plans to kill Lula. He was found guilty on other charges including participating in an armed criminal organization and attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.",
      "They also cited Justice Luiz Fux, the sole dissenting vote in the five-member panel that convicted Bolsonaro, arguing that even if Bolsonaro had attempted a coup, he \u201cdeliberately interrupted the course of events\u201d and did not follow through.",
      "However, Fux has since left the panel and will not participate in the review of the appeals.",
      "De Moraes stated that there was sufficient evidence to prove Bolsonaro was aware of the coup plot that aimed to keep him in power.",

      "But far from the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, Pokrovsk is also critical to a diplomatic struggle, as both Russia and Ukraine attempt to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that they have the upper hand in the fighting and the other side is weaker.",

      "Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of 60,000, once served as a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. However, Russia used its artillery to establish an advantage over key routes, denying Ukrainian forces the ability to move freely, conduct evacuations and ferry in supplies.",

      "This week, the pirates have launched multiple attacks against vessels before successfully boarding the Malta-flagged Hellas Aphrodite, which was en route to India from South Africa and ferrying gasoline, according to the ship\u2019s owner, Latsco Marine Management Inc. EU Naval reached the ship on Friday and found all crew members safe.",

      "China\u2019s newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has officially entered service, making it the third in the country\u2019s fleet",
      "WASHINGTON -- With the commissioning of its third aircraft carrier, China now boasts the second largest number of such ships in the world, though it still lags far behind the 11 operated by the U.S. Navy.",

      "America's 11 carriers all have catapult launchers, but the 10 Nimitz-class carriers use a steam system rather than an electromagnetic one.",
      "The steam catapults put more stress on both the aircraft and the ship, requiring more maintenance, and take up more space.",
      "The electromagnetic version operates more efficiently and can also handle a wider range of aircraft, because its launch power can be calibrated to handle both lightweight drones and heavier planes.",

      "Senate Republicans are moving to try to end the government shutdown by preparing a new bipartisan package of funding bills and daring Democrats to vote for it",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are moving to try to end the government shutdown by preparing a new bipartisan package of spending bills and daring Democrats to vote for it, but it was unclear if their plan would work.",
      "Many Democrats said they would continue to hold out for an extension of expiring health care subsidies, which was not expected to be part of the legislation.",
      "Senate Democrats, who have now voted 14 times not to reopen the government, left their second caucus meeting of the week Thursday with few answers about whether they eventually could find a compromise with Republicans \u2014 or even with each other \u2014 on how to end the shutdown.",
      "A test vote on the new package, which had not yet been publicly revealed, could come as soon as Friday. Democrats will then have a crucial choice to make: Do they keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending health care subsidies that expire in January, while extending the pain of the shutdown? Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?",
      "Emboldened by overwhelmingly favorable elections earlier this week, many Democrats say the fight isn\u2019t over until Republicans and President Donald Trump negotiate with them on an extension.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what leaders do,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico. \u201cYou have the gavel, you have the majority, you have to bring people together.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said Democrats are \u201cobviously not unanimous\u201d but they are unified that \"without something on health care, the vote is very unlikely to succeed.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats have been working on a deal that would reopen the government with only an agreement for a future vote on the health care subsidies. Lawmakers in both parties were feeling increased urgency to alleviate the growing crisis at airports, pay government workers and restore delayed food aid to millions of people now that the shutdown has become the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune's decision to keep the Senate in session Friday, and perhaps over the weekend, came after Trump urged Senate Republicans at a White House breakfast Wednesday to end the shutdown. Trump said he thought the six-week impasse was a \u201cbig factor, negative\u201d for Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "The bipartisan package Thune is proposing would fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things \u2014 and extend funding for everything else until December or January.",
      "The new package would replace the House-passed bill that the Democrats have repeatedly rejected. That legislation would only extend government funding until Nov. 21, a date that is rapidly approaching after six weeks of inaction.",
      "The details were still to be worked out, but the new legislation mirrors a tentative plan that moderate Democrats have been sketching out in hopes of finding agreement. The proposal led by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen would also take up Republicans on their offer to hold a vote on extending the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies at a later date.",
      "It was still unclear what Thune, who has refused to negotiate while the government is closed, would promise on health care and if enough Democrats would agree to move ahead. Republicans have for weeks been five votes short of the 60 they need.",

      "The unemployment rate is low and the economy is still growing, but those out of work face the slowest pace of hiring in more than a decade",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Carly Kaprive left a job in Kansas City and moved to Chicago a year ago, she figured it would take three to six months to find a new position. After all, the 32-year old project manager had never been unemployed for longer than three months.",
      "Instead, after 700 applications, she's still looking, wrapped up in a frustrating and extended job hunt that is much more difficult than when she last looked for work just a couple of years ago. With uncertainty over interest rates, tariffs, immigration, and artificial intelligence roiling much of the economy, some companies she's interviewed with have abruptly decided not to fill the job at all.",
      "\u201cI have definitely had mid-interview roles be eliminated entirely, that they are not going to move forward with even hiring anybody,\u201d she said.",
      "Kaprive is caught in a historical anomaly: The unemployment rate is low and the economy is still growing, but those out of work face the slowest pace of hiring in more than a decade. Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, calls it a \u201cjobless boom.\u201d",
      "While big corporate layoff announcements typically grab the most attention, it has been the unwillingness of many companies to add workers that has created a more painful job market than the low 4.3% unemployment rate would suggest. It is also more bifurcated: The \u201clow hire, low fire\u201d economy has meant fewer layoffs for those with jobs, while the unemployed struggle to find work.",
      "\u201cIt's like an insider-outsider thing,\u201d Guy Berger, head of research at the Burning Glass Institute said, \u201cwhere outsiders that need jobs are struggling to get their foot in, even as insiders are insulated by what up until now is a low-layoff environment.\u201d",
      "Several large companies have recently announced tens of thousands of job cuts in the past few weeks, including UPS, Target, and IBM, though Berger said it is too soon to tell whether they signal a turn for the worse in the economy. But a rise in job cuts would be particularly challenging with hiring already so low.",
      "For now, it's harder than ever to get a clear read on the job market because the government shutdown has cut off the U.S. Department of Labor's monthly employment reports. The October jobs report was scheduled for release Friday but has been delayed, like the September figures before it. The October report may be less comprehensive when it is released because not all the data may be collected.",
      "Before the shutdown, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate \u2014 the number of people hired in a given month, as a percentage of those employed \u2014 fell to 3.2% in August, matching the lowest figure outside the pandemic since March 2013.",
      "Back then, the unemployment rate was a painful 7.5%, as the economy slowly recovered from the job losses from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. That is much higher than August's 4.3%.",
      "Many of those out of work are skeptical of the current low rate. Brad Mislow, 54, has been mostly unemployed for the past three years after losing a job as an advertising executive in New York City. Now he is substitute teaching to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cIt is frustrating to hear that the unemployment rate is low, the economy is great,\" he said. \u201cI think there are people in this economy who are basically fighting every day and holding on to pieces of flotsam in the shark-filled waters or, they have no idea what it's like.\u201d",
      "With the government closed, financial markets are paying closer attention to private-sector data, but that is also mixed. On Thursday, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas unnerved investors with a report that announced job cuts surged 175% in October from a year ago.",
      "Yet on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that net hiring picked up in October as businesses added 42,000 jobs, after two months of declines. Still, the gain was modest. ADP's figures are based on anonymous data from the 26 million workers at its client companies.",
      "Separately, Revelio Labs, a workplace analytics company, estimated Thursday that the economy shed 9,000 jobs in October. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimates that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% last month.",
      "Even when the government was releasing data, economists and officials at the Federal Reserve weren't sure how healthy the job market was or where it was headed next. A sharp drop in immigration and stepped-up deportations have helped keep the unemployment rate low simply by reducing the supply of workers. The economy doesn't need to create as many jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising.",

      "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player and assistant coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he profited from rigged poker games and provided sports bettors with non-public information about injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.",
      "Jones, a onetime teammate of James, said little during back-to-back arraignments in federal court in Brooklyn, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter not guilty pleas in a pair of cases stemming from last month\u2019s federal takedown of sprawling gambling operations.",
      "Jones, 49, acknowledged he read both indictments and that he understood the charges and his bail conditions, which include his mother and stepfather putting up their Texas home as collateral for a $200,000 bond that will allow him to remain free pending trial.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, told a judge that they \u201cmay be engaging in plea negotiations.\u201d He is due back in court for a preliminary conference with other defendants on Nov. 24.",
      "Jones was among more than 30 people arrested in the gambling sweep. The others included reputed mobsters and prominent basketball figures, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier.",
      "Sports bettor Marves Fairley also pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges alleging he cashed in on information about injuries to NBA players, including some that prosecutors say Jones provided to him.",
      "Jones, an NBA journeyman, earned more than $20 million playing for 10 teams in 11 seasons from 1999 to 2009. He and James played together in Cleveland from 2005 to 2008 and he served as an unofficial assistant coach for James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers during the 2022-2023 season.",
      "According to prosecutors, Jones sold or attempted to sell non-public information to bettors that James was injured and wouldn't be playing in a Feb. 9, 2023, game against the Milwaukee Bucks, texting an unnamed co-conspirator: \u201cGet a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out.\u201d",
      "James wasn't listed on the Lakers' injury report at the time of the text message, but the NBA's all-time scoring leader was later ruled out of the game because of a lower body jury, according to prosecutors, and the Lakers lost the game 115-106.",
      "On Jan. 15, 2024, prosecutors said, Fairley paid Jones approximately $2,500 for a tip that Davis, the Lakers' forward and center at the time, would see limited playing time against the Oklahoma City Thunder because of an injury.",
      "Fairley then placed a $100,000 bet on the Thunder to win, prosecutors said, but the tip was wrong. Davis played his usual minutes, scored 27 points and collected 15 rebounds in a 112-105 Lakers win, prompting Fairley to demand a refund of his $2,500 fee, prosecutors said.",

      "President Donald Trump has named Andrea Lucas as chair of the country's top workplace civil rights agency, the agency announced Thursday. The move signals a vote of confidence for Lucas's efforts to stamp out diversity programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and prioritize religious rights in the workplace.",
      "First nominated to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 during Trump's first administration, Lucas was confirmed in July for a second five-year term. Democratic lawmakers and dozens of civil rights organizations strongly opposed Lucas\u2019 confirmation, accusing her of politicizing the agency against Congress\u2019s intent and undermining workers' civil rights. Republican senators praised her leadership, especially her commitment to rolling back Biden-era guidance on workplace gender identity protections, which Lucas has argued overstepped the EEOC\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m honored to be designated Chair of the EEOC,\u201d Lucas said in an emailed statement Thursday. \u201cUnder the Trump Administration, the Commission has made significant progress advancing its core mission to uphold our nation\u2019s civil rights laws and protect American workers through consistent, effective enforcement. As Chair, I remain committed to enforcing the law evenhandedly, advancing equal opportunity, and upholding merit-based, colorblind equality in America\u2019s workplaces.\u201d",
      "Trump elevated Lucas to acting chair in January and, in an unprecedented move, fired two Democratic commissioners, clearing the way to establish a Republican majority in the agency. The Senate last month confirmed Trump pick Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner, restoring the EEOC to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "In a shake-up of the agency's prior focus, the EEOC under Lucas's leadership has taken on several religious discrimination cases, including a charge against Mayo Clinic alleging it refused to grant a security guard\u2019s request for a religious accommodation to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. The hospital system did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It has also dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny, and stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d a concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out employment practices that disadvantage different demographic groups. Lucas has leveraged the agency to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",

      "LOS CABOS, Mexico -- Matti Schmid rolled in a 30-foot eagle putt with about 6 feet of break during a six-hole stretch he played in 6-under par that carried the German to a 9-under 63 and a one-shot lead Friday in the World Wide Technology Championship.",
      "Nick Dunlap, who tied the course record of 61 in the opening round, was keeping pace and pulled one shot ahead of Schmid until a tee shot out of play on his 16th hole, the par-4 seventh, that led to double bogey. He closed with two pars for a 67 and was one shot behind.",
      "Sami Valimaki of Finland, who also shot a 61 in the first round, birdied three of his last five holes for a 67 to join Dunlap a shot behind at El Cardonal at Diamante.",
      "Only three tournaments, including this one on the southern tip of Baja California, remain this season. The top 100 in the FedEx Cup \u2014 down from 125 in previous years \u2014 retain full PGA Tour cards for next season.",
      "That's not an issue for Schmid, who came into this week at No. 70. His hopes are to finish in the top 60 and earn a spot in two $20 million signature events to start next year.",
      "\u201cWe all know how big those are and the added points you can earn in those, and also I want to play the best courses against the best players,\" Schmid said. \u201cObviously, that was the goal for the fall season. You need to have a really good week, and hopefully this is mine.\"",
      "Schmid, a 27-year-old German who played his college golf at Louisville, at least put himself in good position going into the weekend.",
      "He started on No. 10 and that bending eagle putt on the par-5 18th allowed him to go out in 29. He only made two birdies on the front nine, both of them on par 5s for his 63.",
      "He was at 17-under 127.",
      "Dunlap is well outside the top 100 but is exempt in 2026 from his two victories last year, including The American Express as an amateur when he was still at Alabama. He followed that 61 with three straight birdies and went out in 30.",
      "But he missed a short birdie chance, and then hit his one wild drive that cost him two shots on the seventh.",

This is really what matters. Family, the closest ones, our dog also was safe, thank God. We're just grateful. We're grateful that everybody is safe and in a great place.\u201d",

They were very kind while they were trying to put out all the flames.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s molecular biology program, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview. Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later.",
      "From 1988 to 1992, he directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Yet he gained unwelcome attention in 2007 when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "\u201cI only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.",
      "In a television documentary that year, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said.",
      "In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cunsupported by science.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",

      "Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, and tracing family trees and ancient human ancestors. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body\u2019s blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person\u2019s offspring.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He later wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Watson never made another lab finding that big. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir and helped guide the project to map the human genome. He picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",
      "Watson died in hospice care after a brief illness, his son said Friday. His former research lab confirmed he passed away a day earlier.",
      "\u201cHe never stopped fighting for people who were suffering from disease,\u201d Duncan Watson said of his father.",
      "Watson's initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease \u2014 maybe in time to help his son.",
      "He gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cunsupported by science.\u201d",
      "Watson\u2019s combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \u201ca regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \u201cHis outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d",
      "Long before that, Watson scorned political correctness.",
      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",
      "Crick himself wrote that the partnership thrived in part because the two men shared \u201ca certain youthful arrogance, a ruthlessness, and an impatience with sloppy thinking.\u201d",
      "Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. (She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s program for molecular biology, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview.",
      "Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.",
      "He transformed the lab into a \u201cvibrant, incredibly important center,\u201d Ptashne said. It was \u201cone of the miracles of Jim: a more disheveled, less smooth, less typically ingratiating person you could hardly imagine.\u201d",
      "From 1988 to 1992, Watson directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Watson was on hand at the White House in 2000 for the announcement that the federal project had completed an important goal: a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome, basically a road map to an estimated 90 percent of human genes.",
      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",

    "story": [
      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",
      "On the opposite side of the building, an enormous banner with Trump\u2019s face read: \u201cAmerican Workers First.\u201d",
      "Former miner and coal truck driver Randy Lawrence said both Trump and Kennedy should do an eight-hour shift underground to see why NIOSH and the silica rule are essential. He said he hopes to send a loud message to the president he voted for, but no longer supports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to hurt the working man,\u201d he said, lugging his oxygen tank. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worried about the miners or people in West Virginia or coal miners anywhere. All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",
      "The worst ones have the number to her cellphone, which is never turned off. Sometimes they call in a panic, desperate for help.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "As the saying went, all roads once led to Rome \u2014 and scientists now say those roads stretched 50% longer than previously known",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the saying went, all roads once led to Rome \u2014 and those roads stretched 50% longer than previously known, according to a new digital atlas published Thursday.",
      "The last major atlas of ancient Roman road networks was published 25 years ago. Since then, advances in technology and other newly accessible sources have greatly expanded researchers\u2019 ability to locate ancient roadways.",
      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data. Scientists then looked for clues in satellite imagery and aerial photography, including recently digitized photos taken from planes during World War II.",
      "When ancient accounts hinted at lost roads in a certain area, researchers analyzed the terrain from above to spot subtle traces \u2014 things like faint differences in vegetation, soil variations or shifts in elevation, as well as traces of ancient engineering like raised mounds or cut hillsides \u2014 that revealed where Roman lanes once ran.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a massive game of connecting the dots on a continental scale,\u201d said Tom Brughmans, an archaeologist and co-author of the study published in Scientific Data.",
      "The data and an interactive digital map are also available online for scholars, history teachers or anyone with an interest in ancient Roman history.",
      "Earlier research had focused on \u201cthe highways of the Roman Empire\u201d \u2014 the large thoroughfares most often mentioned in familiar historical accounts, said Brughmans.",
      "The updated map fills in more obscure details about \u201csecondary roads, like the country lanes, that connected villas and farms\u201d and other locations, said Brughmans, who's based at Aarhus University in Denmark.",
      "Researchers previously tallied the extent of Roman roads as covering around 117,163 miles (188,555 kilometers). The new work shows nearly 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) of roads across the extent of the Roman Empire, allowing travel from Spain to Syria.",
      "The study added a lot to archaeologists' knowledge of ancient roads in North Africa, the plains of France and in the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece.",
      "\u201cThis will be a very foundational work for a lot of other research,\u201d said archaeologist Benjamin Ducke of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin, who was not involved in the project.",

      "Being able to visualize the ancient routes that Roman farmers, soldiers, diplomats and other travelers took will provide a better understanding of key historical trends that depended on the movement of people during Roman times, said Brughmans, including the rise of Christianity across the region and the spread of ancient outbreaks.",
      "\u201cThe Romans left a huge impact with this road network,\u201d which created the blueprint for many roads still in use today, said study co-author and archaeologist Adam Pa\u017eout of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.",

But during that time, they also funded underprivileged schools, immigration reform and efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, the billionaire couple is shifting the bulk of their philanthropic resources to Biohub, the pair's science organization, and focusing on using artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery. The idea is to develop virtual, AI-based cell models to understand how they work in the human body, study inflammation and use AI to \u201charness the immune system\u201d for disease detection, prevention and treatment.",
      "\u201cI feel like the science work that we\u2019ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done. So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,\u201d Zuckerberg said Wednesday evening at an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City, California. Three other Biohub institutes \u2014 in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, focus on addressing different scientific challenges.",
      "Chan and Zuckerberg have pledged 99% of their lifetime wealth \u2014 from shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO \u2014 toward these efforts. Since 2016, when Biohub launched, they have donated $4 billion to basic science research, a figure that does not include operating expenses for running a large-scale computer cluster for life science research. The organization says it is now on track to double that amount over the next decade, with an operating budget of about $1 billion a year.",
      "Last week, singer Billie Eilish told an audience that included Chan and Zuckerberg that rich people should do more to address the world\u2019s problems.",
      "\u201cLove you all, but there\u2019s a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\u201d she said, to a smattering of applause. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\u201d",
      "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s charitable organization, has been faced with criticism recently for curtailing its other philanthropic work. Earlier this year, it stopped funding grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion, immigration advocacy and other issues currently in the crosshairs of the Trump administration \u2014 though the focus has been shifting to science and away from social issues for years, the couple says, long before the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cSo we basically looked at the ecosystem of science funding and decided that the place that we can make the biggest impact was on tool development,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd specifically working on long-term projects, 10 to 15 years, where the output of them was taking on a biological challenge that would produce a tool that scientists everywhere could use to accelerate the pace of science.\u201d",
      "The organization earlier this year scrubbed its website's mentions of DEI, including a statement saying \u201cPeople of color and marginalized communities have experienced a long history of exploitation in the name of scientific research, and indeed science has itself been deployed as a tool of oppression.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing forward, Biohub will be our primary philanthropic effort and where we\u2019ll dedicate the vast majority of our resources,\u201d Zuckerberg and Chan said in a blog post Thursday. \u201cWe will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives.\u201d",

Similar to how large language models learn from vast databases of digital books, online writings and other media, its researchers and scientists are working toward building virtual systems that serve as digital representations of human physiology on all levels, such as molecular, cellular or genome. As it is open source \u2014 free and publicly available \u2014 scientists can then conduct virtual experiments on a scale not possible in physical laboratories.",

We have cured diseases for mice and for flies and for zebrafish, many, many times. And that\u2019s great. But we want to make sure that we are actually using biology to push the forefront of medicine for people \u2014 and that is so promising.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",
      "The Merops system has been chosen because it has been used successfully in Ukraine. If something doesn\u2019t work there, it\u2019s \u201cprobably not worthwhile acquiring,\u201d Lowin said.",
      "Drones are evolving rapidly, and each new type demands a different response: The challenge is to identify the threat and then almost immediately work out how to attack it, said Brig. Gen. Zacarias Hernandez, deputy chief of staff plans at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "That requires extremely fast production cycles \u2014 from development to battlefield within weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia is also mass-producing attack drones, equipping them with cameras, jet-propelled engines and advanced anti-jamming antennae.",

      "Ukraine, NATO and Russia are in a game of technological cat-and-mouse, the NATO officials suggested.",

      "She instantly recognized the holiday snap from her Instagram account, but something was different: Her clothing had been digitally removed to make her appear naked. It was a deepfake.",
      "\u201cIt overwhelmed me so much,\u201d Watson recalled. \u201cI just started bursting out in tears, because suddenly, I was there naked.\u201d",
      "In the four years since her experience, deepfakes \u2014 highly realistic artificial intelligence-generated images, videos or audio of real people or events \u2014 have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic. That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission. A bill that's expected to pass early next year would change copyright law by imposing a ban on the sharing of deepfakes to protect citizens\u2019 personal characteristics \u2014 such as their appearance or voice \u2014 from being imitated and shared online without their consent.",
      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",
      "He added: \"We can\u2019t just pretend that this is business as usual for how we think about those key parts of our identity and our dignity.\"",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation in May that makes it illegal to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including deepfakes. Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.",
      "Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said that the bill has broad support from lawmakers in Copenhagen, because such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and spread misinformation.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to deepfake a politician without her or him being able to have that product taken down, that will undermine our democracy,\u201d he told reporters during an AI and copyright conference in September.",
      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",
      "Ajder said Google-owned YouTube, for example, has a \u201cvery, very good system for getting the balance between copyright protection and freedom of creativity.\"",

      "An Indian air force transport plane left Thailand en route to India and another plane was to leave later in the day, with about 270 out of 465 Indians who are to be repatriated.

      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\u201cAt first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\u201d said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7 trillion kilometers).",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. But scientists still aren\u2019t sure how they form.",

      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for tripling government spending artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech to the legislature",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday called for tripling the government spending on projects for expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech.",
      "Lee also called for lawmakers to approve a planned 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the military\u2019s weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States, as the allies\u2019 military chiefs met in Seoul for annual security talks.",
      "Most conservative opposition lawmakers boycotted Lee\u2019s speech amid an ongoing rift over a criminal investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came after South Korea last week hosted the leaders of major Pacific Rim nations for this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which his government used to showcase its ambitions for AI and advance an effort at a trade deal with the U.S.",
      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",
      "Lee said the proposed budget of 728 trillion won ($506 billion), which would represent an all-time high for government spending, would be the country\u2019s \u201cfirst budget to open the AI era.\u201d",
      "He called on the liberal-led legislature to approve 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion) in AI-related spending \u2014 more than triple this year\u2019s level \u2014 to advance the country\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities, with a particular focus on industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding and robotics.",
      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",
      "Lee said South Korean companies would have little difficulty securing the chips for their AI projects, citing a deal for Nvidia, whose GPUs power much of the global AI industry, to supply 260,000 graphics processing units for AI infrastructure projects with major South Korean businesses and the government. The deal was announced following a meeting during APEC between Lee and Jensen Huang, the Silicon Valley company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when Nvidia \u2014 which agreed to deliver 50,000 GPUs each to the government, chipmakers Samsung and SK, and automaker Hyundai, and another 60,000 to internet company Naver \u2014 will deliver those chips. Huang told reporters in South Korea that AI data centers and power networks must first be established before the company can begin shipping the GPUs.",

      "Lee proposed a defense budget of 66.3 trillion won ($46 billion) next year, which he said will be focused on modernizing the military\u2019s weapons systems, including through the adoption of AI technologies, to make the armed forces more self-reliant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national pride that South Korea, which spends 1.4 times North Korea\u2019s annual GDP on defense and is perceived as the world\u2019s fifth most powerful military, continues to depend on others for its security,\u201d Lee said.",
      "During his meeting with Trump, Lee reaffirmed South Korea\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending and called for U.S. support for South Korean efforts to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "Trump later said on social media that the United States will share closely-held technology to allow South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine, and that the vessel will be built in the Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, which was bought last year by South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Group.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back were meeting in Seoul for the allies\u2019 annual security talks. The meeting is expected to address key alliance issues, including South Korea\u2019s defense spending commitments and the implementation of a plan to transfer wartime operational control to a joint command led by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy.",

    "story": [
      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

      "Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, captured 78% of voters under 30 and 66% of those voters 30 to 44 in Tuesday's election, according to ABC News exit polls, conducted by SSRS. Among voters 45 to 64, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo edged out Mamdani, 53% to 47%. A majority of voters 65 and older (55%) voted for Cuomo while 36% voted for Mamdani. Additionally, newcomers to the city were some of the most likely voters in the state to vote for Mamdani, with 81% of those who have lived in New York City less than 10 years supporting him, the exit polls found.",
      "Along with his electoral success among younger and newer New Yorkers, Mamdani also earned support from 55% of voters who lived in the city for over 10 years, but were not born in the city. More of those who were born in New York City voted for Cuomo (49%) than Mamdani (38%), according to the exit polls.",
      "More first-time New York City mayoral voters also voted for Mamdani than those who have previously voted for mayor in the city, 66% versus 47%, the exit polls found.",
      "Greer said this accomplishment in gathering the majority of the youth's vote was through Mamdani's engagement in social media, along with the campaign's clear message about working as a community.",
      "\"This campaign, which was incredibly run, was clear and consistent that it's not just about beating someone else -- meaning the Republican Party or Donald Trump or Andrew Cuomo -- it was about an additive type of politics, where if we work together, we can collectively get more. I think that message resonated with a lot of people,\" Greer said.",
      "Additionally, Mamdani's focus on the affordability of New Yorkers -- specifically his plans to freeze rent for rent-stabilized apartments and provide universal child care and free buses -- \"resonated\" with younger generations, according to Jessica Siles, the senior director of communications for advocacy organization Voters of Tomorrow.",
      "\"I think New York has some specific affordability issues that maybe aren't everywhere in the country. When you are moving to New York, there are certain financial hurdles in some ways that make things difficult. So fresh faces absolutely are looking for some relief and leadership that is able to at least have them feel like they're better equipped to navigate them,\" Siles told ABC News.",
      "Asked to comment on Mamdani securing the votes of younger people and newcomers to the city, a spokesperson for Cuomo's campaign said, \"it's more than that.\"",
      "\"This needs to be a city for everyone and the fact that nearly half of New Yorkers from across the spectrum united against what the democratic nominee in an overwhelmingly democratic city campaigned on shouldn't be overlooked,\" Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement to ABC News. \"We're proud of the campaign Andrew Cuomo ran in the general, a record 42% on an independent ballot line buried on the ballot.\"",

      "Frey, who secured a third term, led Fateh by about 10 percentage points after Tuesday night's first round of counting but didn't cross the 50%-plus-one-vote threshold he needed to win outright.",
      "According to final but unofficial results posted by the city, Frey got 50.03% of the vote in the second and final round to 44.37% for Fateh. Frey's finish was an improvement from his 49.1% in 2021.",
      "The way ranked-choice voting works in Minneapolis, if no candidate clears the threshold in the first round, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated for the next round of counting, while second- and third-choice rankings are allocated to the surviving candidates.",

      "\u201cFrom right now through my final seconds as mayor, I will work tirelessly to make our great city a place where everyone, regardless of who you are or where you come from, can build a brilliant life in an affordable home and a safe neighborhood,\" Frey said in a statement. He planned to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to further comment.",
      "Fateh congratulated Frey on his win.",
      "\u201cThey may have won this race, but we have changed the narrative about what kind of city Minneapolis can be,\" Fateh said in a statement. \u201cBecause now, truly affordable housing, workers\u2019 rights, and public safety rooted in care are no longer side conversations; they are at the center of the narrative.\u201d",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s molecular biology program, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview. Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later.",
      "From 1988 to 1992, he directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA.

He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",

      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "\u201cI only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.",

      "President Donald Trump has claimed over the past two days that costs for the Thanksgiving meal are down 25% this year, citing a prepackaged Thanksgiving meal basket from Walmart.",
      "\u201cI just saw that Walmart came out with a statement last night, they've done it for many years, that Thanksgiving this year will cost 25% less than Thanksgiving last year,\u201d he said during a news conference on Friday with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "But Trump\u2019s numbers are off. Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Walmart prices show that the cost of Thanksgiving dinner is 25% lower in 2025 than in 2024.",
      "THE FACTS: This is misleading. While Walmart's 2025 meal basket costs about 25% less than the one from 2024, that's because it offers fewer items and different products that make it more affordable.",
      "\u201cIt's not apples to apples, right?\u201d said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University. \u201cWhat this does highlight is individual retailers\u2019 strategies for getting customers in the door.\u201d",
      "The 2025 basket costs less than $40 and feeds 10 people, about $4 a head, according to Walmart. In 2024, a basket for eight cost approximately $56, less than $7 per person. That's about a 25% decrease, possibly more depending on price fluctuations. John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., touted the savings in a LinkedIn post last month.",
      "But the baskets differ significantly. For example, this year's includes just 15 items compared to last year's 29. It is missing many dessert items, including a pecan pie, mini marshmallows and muffin mix, as well as savory items such as sweet potatoes, yellow onions and celery stalks.",
      "The superstore retailer has also substituted some products. Instead of 12 sweet Hawaiian rolls, the 2025 deal includes 12 dinner rolls. Both are from Walmart's store brand. It also offers Kinder's crispy fried onions as opposed to French's.",
      "Plus, the amount of each item varies. Customers were promised a 10-16 pound turkey in 2024, but a 13.5 pound one this year. And they'll get one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of two.",
      "\u201cThey're marketing it that \u2018hey, this is a more affordable way,\u2019 yet that implies that 'man, stuff's a lot more expensive,'\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI guess it's good marketing.\u201d",

      "Investigators say a repeating bell sounded as pilots tried to control a UPS cargo plane upon takeoff before it crashed in Louisville, Kentucky, this week",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne when a bell sounded in the cockpit. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball, the chief investigator said Friday.",
      "The crash Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company\u2019s global aviation hub in Louisville, Kentucky, killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said the cockpit voice recorder captured the bell that sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\u201cIt occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\u201d Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman\u2019s news conference. \u201cThey were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They\u2019ll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\u201d",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles.",
      "The NTSB clarified Friday that preliminary data on the aircraft\u2019s altitude indicated it got only about 100 feet above ground level, not 475 feet. It reached a speed of 210 mph (340 kph) before crashing just outside the airport, Inman said.",
      "The left engine\u2019s main component and pieces of fan blades were recovered from the airfield. Inman said UPS indicated no maintenance work was performed just before the flight. He noted investigators will look at video to see what, if anything, was being done around the MD-11 aircraft in preceding days.",

      "In a statement, Planned Parenthood officials described the lawsuit as a \u201cpolitically motivated attack\u201d aimed at further eroding access to abortion in Florida, which bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.",
      "\u201cAnti-abortion lawmakers and officials are relentless in their effort to end access to all abortion care, and to stop patients from getting accurate medical information.

      "WASHINGTON -- After voters swung toward Republican Donald Trump during last fall\u2019s presidential election, states like Virginia and New Jersey swung back towards Democratic candidates at nearly the same velocity as 2024\u2019s shift, an Associated Press analysis of election data from this week found.",
      "From populous suburbs to big cities to military-heavy counties, this year\u2019s electorate moved decisively towards the Democratic Party. Some of these areas had the largest shifts towards Trump last year, particularly in New York and New Jersey, but on Tuesday, the returns more closely resembled 2020 margins.",
      "This came alongside relatively high turnout, at least compared to recent off-year elections, suggesting that one pattern of the last decade in American politics \u2014 Republicans doing well when Trump is on the ballot, and Democrats doing better when he is not \u2014 continues to hold.",
      "The AP\u2019s analysis is based off county- and precinct-level data. In all cases, 2025 margins are as of 10:45 a.m. on Nov. 7. Additional votes will be counted as election officials tabulate late-arriving mail and provisional ballots. Here are some of the findings.",
      "Virginia and New Jersey, the two states that elect governors in the year following a presidential election, both have a tradition of moving against the party in the White House.",
      "Starting in 1976, every time a party has won back control of the presidency, Virginia voters have chosen a governor from the opposing party the following year. And in New Jersey, voters elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting president in every election from 1989 to 2017.",
      "Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill continued this trend with double-digit victories.",
      "Spanberger\u2019s victory was especially notable for its scale. In the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections, the average margin of victory was 8.6 percentage points.",
      "Spanberger\u2019s 14.4-point win \u2014 coming a year after Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won the state by just 5.8 percentage points \u2014 was bolstered by big margins in Northern Virginia, home to Washington, D.C., suburbs heavily affected by federal government cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. It also greatly exceeded former President Joe Biden\u2019s 10.1-point victory in 2020.",
      "These shifts helped Spanberger win 15 counties and independent cities that her predecessor, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, had won four years earlier. Six of those jurisdictions \u2014 Spotsylvania, Lynchburg, Nelson, Waynesboro, Prince Edward and Surry \u2014 also supported Trump in 2024.",
      "Spanberger also benefited from a spending advantage of around $27 million and Trump\u2019s reluctance to endorse her Republican opponent.",
      "In succeeding term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, Sherrill not only restarted New Jersey\u2019s history of voting for the party not in power but also broke a 60-year streak. No party has held the New Jersey governorship for more than three consecutive terms since the 1960s, when a two-term Democratic governor succeeded another two-term Democratic governor.",
      "Recent voting patterns in New Jersey suggested the governor\u2019s race could have been much tighter. And in addition to receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement, Republican Jack Ciattarelli kept pace with Sherrill in terms of spending.",
      "He also got close the election prior. Ciattarelli came within 3 points of ousting Murphy in 2021. And between Ciattarelli\u2019s 2021 and 2025 campaigns, Trump made massive inroads in New Jersey: He flipped five counties that Biden won in 2020 and cut the Republican margin in the state down to just 5.9 percentage points.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s 13.5-point win indicated a return to pre-2024 levels. While she fell short of Biden\u2019s 15.9-point win, she returned all five of the counties Trump flipped to the Democratic column. She also improved on Harris\u2019 margin in Bergen County, the state\u2019s largest, by more than 8 points.",
      "Some of Tuesday\u2019s elections were notable outliers in terms of the number of people they brought to the polls, while others were more in line with past races.",

Andrew Cuomo in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.",

      "In Virginia, home to one of the largest concentrations of federal workers as well as major military bases, federal workers in particular supported Spanberger.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon is revamping how the military buys weapons, shifting the focus away from producing advanced and complex technology and toward products that can be made and delivered quickly",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday the Pentagon is revamping how the military buys weapons, shifting the focus away from producing advanced and complex technology and toward products that can be made and delivered quickly.",
      "Hegseth, speaking to military leaders and defense contractors in Washington, said the \"objective is simple: transform the entire acquisition system to operate on a wartime footing, to rapidly accelerate the fielding of capabilities and focus on results.\u201d",
      "Hegseth gave his address, which ran for more than an hour, at the National War College. It delved much more into military minutia than a previous big speech to hundreds of military leaders abruptly summoned to a base in Virginia, where he declared an end to \u201cwoke\u201d culture and announced \u201cgender-neutral\u201d directives for troops.",
      "Hegseth acknowledged the granularity Friday, saying, \u201cIf folks are watching this on Fox, their eyes are rolling over.\u201d",
      "The defense secretary argued his changes are meant to move the military away from the more traditional process that prioritized delivering a perfect, if expensive and late, product in favor of something that is less ideal but delivered quickly. Some experts say the changes could mean less transparency and the military ending up with systems that may not function as expected.",
      "\u201cAn 85% solution in the hands of our armed forces today is infinitely better than an unachievable 100% solution ... endlessly undergoing testing or awaiting additional technological development,\u201d he said. He asserted that what used to take several years could happen within one.",
      "The shift is coming as Russia\u2019s grinding war has seen an underfunded Ukraine using cheap, mass-produced drones to effectively hold off a technologically superior Moscow, which is armed with advanced missiles and hundreds of tanks.",
      "\u201cDrones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation, accounting for most of this year\u2019s casualties in Ukraine,\u201d Hegseth argued in a July memo before declaring that \u201cwhile global military drone production skyrocketed over the last three years, the previous administration deployed red tape.\u201d That memo lifted some Pentagon restrictions on drone purchases.",
      "Todd Harrison, a defense budget and acquisition expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said Hegseth\u2019s ideas represent a significant shift in how the military would buy arms.",
      "But he warned that if contractors aren\u2019t incentivized \u201cto check all the boxes\u201d for everything the military wants in a product, \u201cthey may deliver something faster, but it may not do what you want it to do.\u201d",
      "The way the U.S. military buys weapons and platforms has faced criticism for various reasons for decades. In recent years, the most famous example of the Pentagon\u2019s failure to get the right gear to the front line was the scores of troops that died from roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan because of poorly armored vehicles that weren\u2019t designed for the conflict.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates used his influence to quickly develop the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, or MRAP, through the acquisition process in under a year.",
      "Hegseth acknowledged the effort Friday, noting that \u201cthe entire process must move at the speed of ... the MRAP.\"",
      "More recently, other Pentagon efforts have tried to replicate this dynamic to quickly deal with the threat of China invading Taiwan or quickly develop swarms of drones, with mixed results.",

But experts said it's unlikely that an investigation would result in lower prices at grocery stores, and a trade group representing meat packers said they're not to blame.",
      "Trump did not present evidence for his claims, writing on social media that \u201cI have asked the DOJ to immediately begin an investigation into the Meat Packing Companies who are driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\u201d",

      "Normally on Veterans Day, volunteers gather at the Riverside National Cemetery in California to place flags alongside more than 300,000 gravesites. But not this year.",
      "The longest federal government shutdown on record is curtailing and outright canceling parades, ceremonies and other events across the U.S. that are normally held to mark Veterans Day. It's another fallout of the shutdown that has disrupted flights and food assistance, and was already being squarely felt by military families who are worried about their paychecks.",
      "In California, organizers of \u201cA Flag for Every Hero\u201d said they couldn't move forward with the event on Tuesday without access to restrooms, traffic control and other needs for the thousands of participants. Elsewhere, a lack of federal employees and access to military facilities has scrubbed other Veterans Day events.",
      "\u201cWe have a responsibility to provide them the resources they need, and unfortunately with the shutdown we're unable to do that,\u201d Laura Herzog, founder and CEO of Honoring Our Fallen, which organizes the Riverside National Cemetery event.",

      "The disruption to a federal holiday that is intended to honor those who have served in the armed forces comes as military families face uncertainty week to week about their pay. The Trump administration has found ways to pay troops twice since the shutdown began Oct. 1.",
      "The Texas National Cemetery Foundation canceled an annual Veterans Day event at the cemetery in Dallas-Fort Worth, saying organizers wouldn't have time to stage the ceremony even if the shutdown ended soon. In Virginia, city leaders in Hampton cited concerns about a lack of servicemembers to participate in its annual parade because of the shutdown.",
      "\u201cOur veterans deserve to be recognized with great pomp and circumstance,\" Hampton City Manager Mary Bunting said in a news release. \u201cWithout the presence of our active-duty military, we are concerned that the parade would appear sparse and that the recognition might fall short of the honor our veterans so richly deserve.\u201d",
      "Organizers of Detroit\u2019s annual Veterans Day parade say they\u2019re moving forward with the Sunday event, but it won\u2019t include an appearance by a U.S. Army band or a helicopter flyover. Others are relying on even more help from volunteers than usual to make up for the lack of federal resources.",
      "The Wyoming Valley Veterans Day Parade, which has been a tradition in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, every year since 1945, will still take place Sunday. But organizers have had to scramble because of the shutdown, asking veterans to participate. And instead of military vehicles, the parade will feature motorcycle groups and car clubs.",
      "\u201cWe're going to have a parade, one way or another,\u201d said Susan Allen, a retired Navy lieutenant commander who chairs the parade committee. \u201cWe have no choice but to make lemonade out of these lemons.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

    "story": [
      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",
      "CBS News has contacted the royal family for comment on the pending removal of the former prince's Royal Naval title.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 11:42:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In his latest film, George Clooney plays a familiar role \u2013 one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 who nonetheless tries to reconcile professional success and his personal shortcomings.",
    "story": [
      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through.

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",

      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

      "Brees added in a statement that he appreciated the opportunity to join Fox and that \"I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insights I provide to the fans each Sunday.\"",
      "In his first year of eligibility, Brees is among the list of 52 modern-era players being considered for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Brees remains second all-time in league history in passing yards (80,358) and passing touchdowns (571).",

      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:00:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",
      "Fifteen of those airports are included on the\u00a0list obtained by CBS News of airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",

That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",
      "\"Tesla's board members have asked shareholders to approve a long-term incentive package for Musk to retain and motivate the CEO to remain in his current leadership role with a new share package where he will only be paid if he attains 'extraordinary financial returns,'\" Ives said in a Nov. 5 research note.",
      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The FAA will reduce U.S. air traffic by 10% at 40 U.S. locations starting on Friday due to the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms.

      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",

Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",
      "\"The ball is in Starbucks' court,\" Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and barista at Starbucks, said in a statement.",
      "If the strike happens this month, it would mark the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",

Overall, the company has more than 200,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/k-shaped-economy-low-middle-high-income-households/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:05:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The shape of economic growth this year highlights the widening gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",
      "What lower-income people \"see from the grocery store, from the gas stations, is that prices are going up while their wages are not going up,\" Nguyen added.",
      "Lower-income households also face a toxic stew of inflation, credit card debt, student loans and mortgage loans, sapping their spending power. They also feel the pinch of a slowing job market more acutely than high-income groups, Zandi told CBS News.",
      "\"They may have a job, although if they lose one, they're having a harder and harder time getting back into the labor market,\" he said.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",

      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",

      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",
      "\"I'm going to have to make use of the pantries and work with their schedule, because if I use actual money for food, it takes away money I need to pay for my residential parking permit, gas and union dues,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Kathleen Hurd, a 64-year-old resident of Detroit, is the main caregiver for her grandson and granddaughter and manages the family's SNAP benefits.",
      "She receives roughly $390 in monthly food stamps, which Hurd said she uses to buy staples such as hamburgers, rice and potatoes.

    "story": [
      "Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors.",
      "The deal, announced\u00a0Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises.",
      "Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday.",
      "Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading.",
      "Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus.",
      "Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box.",
      "Treville Capital is an investment firm whose chairman is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and former president of the Walt Disney Co.",
      "Denny's reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. Valade said Denny's board believed the deal announced Monday was in the best interest of shareholders and the best path forward for the company.",
      "\"Denny's is an iconic piece of the American dream, with a renowned brand, a strong franchise base and loyal customers,\" said Rohit Manocha, co-founder at TriArtisan, in the statement.",
      "Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022.",
      "If approved by Denny's shareholders, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday froze, for now, a lower court order that required the Trump administration to swiftly provide full federal food benefits to roughly 42 million Americans.",
      "The order from Jackson is temporary. She said it will give a federal appeals court more time to consider whether to provide the Trump administration with longer emergency relief while an appeal in the dispute over payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program moves forward.",
      "The Supreme Court's late-stage intervention came as the Trump administration closed in on an end-of-day deadline, set by a district court judge Thursday, to cover in full food assistance for November and use roughly $4 billion for other nutrition programs to do so. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit had temporarily left in place the lower court's decision, after which the Justice Department sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "Jackson wrote in a brief order that her administrative stay will \"facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution\" of the Trump administration's request for the longer pause of the district court's decision. She said the appeals court should resolve the pending motion \"with dispatch.\"",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it has already exhausted the entirety of a more than $5 billion contingency reserve, which was enough to provide only partial food assistance payments for the month. It warned that the additional $4 billion needed to cover the full allotments for low-income Americans would require it to dip into a fund designated for Child Nutrition Programs.",
      "\"Pulling billions of dollars from the Child Nutrition Programs would jeopardize those programs' ability to fully operate this year \u2014 putting at risk critical food-assistance initiatives relied upon by millions of children every day, and raiding a program that Congress did fund to instead extend one that Congress has not funded,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "A USDA official notified states earlier Friday that it was working to comply with the district court's order to provide in-full the food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision is the latest development in the legal battle over SNAP benefits that has unfolded over the past several days. The payments are used by recipients to purchase groceries, but the USDA said late last month that assistance for November would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "A group of cities and nonprofit organizations sued the USDA last week amid rising concerns that the lapse in payments would leave millions of low-income Americans hungry. U.S. District Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case, then ordered the Trump administration to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to the roughly 42 million Americans enrolled in the program for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",
      "The plaintiffs then asked McConnell for additional relief that would require the Trump administration to make full SNAP payments \"immediately.\"",
      "In a decision Thursday, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot \u2014 to do so. McConnell said comments from administration officials indicate that food benefits are being withheld for \"political purposes.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the 1st Circuit, the Justice Department claimed that the judge's order \"makes a mockery of the separation of powers\" and directed the USDA to find $4 billion \"in the metaphorical couch cushions.\"",

    "summary": "Subpoenas went out to former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to a source.",
    "story": [
      "A federal grand jury has subpoenaed three former CIA and FBI officials who were involved in the federal government's investigations into alleged Russian meddling to assist President Trump's 2016 campaign, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The subpoenas went out to former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to the source, who added that more subpoenas could be issued in the coming days.",
      "The source said the investigation focuses on the Trump-Russia matter \u2014 an issue that has rankled Mr. Trump and his allies for years.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the CIA, the Justice Department and Brennan, and attorneys for Strzok and Page.",
      "Fox News Digital was first to report on Brennan, Strzok and Page's subpoenas.",
      "The FBI's investigation into Russian election interference \u2014 named \"Crossfire Hurricane\" \u2014 was opened in 2016 and was later taken over by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. He eventually concluded that Russia sought to help Mr. Trump win and that the Trump campaign was sometimes \"receptive\" to Russia's help, but did not allege any illegal ties.",
      "Meanwhile, in early 2017, the CIA \u2014 then led by Brennan \u2014 and several other intelligence agencies assessed that Russia had tried to influence the election and \"developed a clear preference\" for Mr. Trump.",
      "Those findings have long infuriated Mr. Trump, who believes the investigations into the Trump-Rusisa issue were politically motivated and aimed at undermining him \u2014 an allegation the leaders of those probes have strongly denied.",
      "In recent months, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified documents that she argues undermine the intelligence community's 2017 assessment, which she called a \"treasonous conspiracy.\"",
      "Brennan, in particular, is a longtime Trump foe. The president revoked Brennan's security clearance during his first term and has called him a \"political hack\" and the \"WORST\" CIA director \"in history.\" And Brennan called Mr. Trump's comments about election interference during a 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sweden \"nothing short of treasonous.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also frequently lashed out against Strzok, who helped open the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane probe, and Page, an attorney at the FBI. The pair had exchanged text messages that were critical of Mr. Trump, according to a probe by the Justice Department's inspector general, drawing the president's ire.",
      "The origins of the Trump-Russia probe have been investigated several times.",
      "The Justice Department's inspector general found the FBI had a sufficient basis to open the investigation, and its decision wasn't motivated by political bias. But the internal watchdog did find several missteps over the course of the probe, including in its handling of search warrants for former Trump adviser Carter Page.",
      "Years later, Trump-era special counsel John Durham conducted his own investigation of the investigators. He was more critical of the FBI, arguing that the bureau's basis for launching the Trump-Russia probe was thin, though the only government official who was criminally charged by Durham was a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email.",

    "summary": "A new documentary, \"Second Wind,\" highlights Ukraine's wounded veterans, following four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro.",
    "story": [
      "As Ukraine's war with Russia grinds into its fourth year, the country is contending with a staggering toll of wounded soldiers and civilians \u2014 and an emerging generation of amputees reshaping what survival looks like in a nation under siege.",
      "A new documentary highlighting the country's wounded veterans screened this week at the French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C. The film, \"Second Wind,\" follows four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, all severely wounded in combat, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro \u2014 an account of grit and perseverance that comes amid one of the largest waves of war-related amputations in modern European history, and that mirrors the country's struggle to rise out of conflict.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that around 380,000 Ukrainian troops have been wounded since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. International medical organizations estimate that between 20,000 and 50,000 Ukrainians \u2014 including soldiers and civilians \u2014 have undergone amputations, with the World Health Organization saying the total number could approach 100,000.",
      "The scale and severity of those injuries have put enormous strain on Ukraine's medical and rehabilitation systems, with hospitals and prosthetic centers operating well beyond capacity.",
      "Filmed by Kyiv-born director Masha Kondakova, \"Second Wind\" documents the physical and psychological rehabilitation of soldiers injured by mines, artillery fire and drone strikes before they undertook their climb up Africa's highest peak. Kondakova, who began filming on the front lines of the conflict in 2014, said she wanted to focus not on the war itself but on what follows survival.",
      "\"We didn't want to make a movie about the war,\" Kondakova said in an interview with CBS News at the embassy of Ukraine in Washington. \"That was not the purpose at all. It's about our simple people, simple guys and one girl who became heroes because they're constantly overcoming their personal limits.\"",
      "\"Just take one step, and you will find your second wind. Maybe not with the first step \u2014 but with the second, you will,\" she said.",
      "Kondakova, who previously directed award-winning films about Ukraine's female soldiers and de-occupied zones near Kyiv, said \"Second Wind\" completes a trilogy about resilience. \"My first movie was about women at war at a moment when women didn't have positions in the army as fighters, and then a short, fictional movie about youth stolen by the war,\" she said. \"This third one \u2014 from the trenches in the east of Ukraine to the summit of Kilimanjaro \u2014 is about the resilience of our defenders. About how our scars become our strength.\"",
      "Among them is Mykhailo Matviiv, a soldier who lost a leg to a Russian airstrike and has since returned to the front lines to work as a drone operator on the eastern front. In an interview alongside Kondakova, he said returning to the front was not a question of choice.",
      "\"I can't live a normal life while my brothers are still at the front,\" he said, through translation. \"The injury created some doubts because I don't want to hold anybody back. But this experience showed me I can still be helpful and useful, as if the injury were not there.\"",
      "Matviiv, who applied his own tourniquet when he was wounded, said he had witnessed enemy forces intentionally target one soldier in order to attract medics or evacuation teams, only to then strike a bigger group.",
      "He added that the film's purpose was not to seek pity but to motivate. \"It's to show that life doesn't end with an injury,\" he said. \"You just climb your own personal summit, step by step.\"",
      "The documentary has already been shown in Ukrainian military hospitals, where Kondakova recalls one of the most emotional moments of her career.",
      "\"We were downstairs in a top secret [bunker] because otherwise we could be a target,\" she said. \"I was sitting behind one of our defenders, very young, who had just had this experience of amputation but no prosthesis yet.\"",
      "\"People were crying or so emotional,\" she said, \"I had a feeling they were with [the film's subjects] for each joke, they laughed as if they were together.\"",
      "Ukraine's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Olha Stefanishyna, said at the screening in Washington that the film was an important reminder for Americans in particular of the value of continued U.S. support for Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "\"It is very important to me that Americans can see what the true spirit of freedom is, and why their support matters,\" Stefanishyna said. \"This film shows that our Ukrainians \u2014 despite losing their legs \u2014 continued to fight, and they carried that spirit to the top of Kilimanjaro.\"",
      "The film arrives as Ukraine faces a long-term rehabilitation crisis. The Ministry of Health has said demand for prosthetics, particularly bionic limbs, has gone up sharply since the start of the war. Medical facilities such as Superhumans Center in Lviv \u2014 one of the country's most advanced prosthetics facilities \u2014 are operating at full capacity, while thousands of soldiers remain on waiting lists.",
      "Kondakova and her team have since launched The Second Wind Project, an organization designed to connect amputees through sports and peer support. \"We want every wounded soldier to feel the shoulder of a brother-in-arms,\" she said.",
      "She said she hopes \"Second Wind\" can also help raise awareness among policymakers and potential donors. \"The process of prosthetics and rehabilitation is long and expensive,\" she said. \"We need not only money, but expertise \u2014 veterans, doctors, specialists who can share experience.\"",
      "For Matviiv, who said after the film's U.S. screenings he will return again to the front near Pokrovsk, where some of the most intense fighting of the war continues, the message is straightforward. \"We are still fighting,\" he said. \"Any limitations that we have, we keep going and we keep defending.\"",
      "\"Second Wind\" continues an international tour this month, with screenings scheduled in New York, London, and Paris.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, is in turmoil after its leader defended former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who interviewed white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes on his popular online show.",
      "The controversy has led to several resignations as the think tank \u2014 which spearheaded Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint meant to guide President Trump's second administration \u2014 addresses the fallout.",
      "What Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts said in defense of Tucker Carlson",
      "As Carlson was criticized by conservatives for giving Fuentes a platform, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts stepped in to defend Carlson, pushing back on speculation that the think tank was distancing itself from its \"close friend\" and decrying the \"venomous coalition\" attacking the former cable news host.",
      "\"The Heritage Foundation didn't become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won't start doing that now,\" Roberts said in a video shared on Oct. 30.",
      "\"Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,\" he continued. \"I disagree with and even abhor things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either.\"",
      "Resignations over Roberts' remarks defending Carlson",
      "Over the following week, at least five members of the Heritage Foundation's antisemitism task force have resigned in protest over Roberts' initial social media post, CBS News has confirmed. Roberts' chief of staff also resigned after initially pushing back online, saying internal critics were \"virtue signaling\" and suggesting they should resign \"if so outraged\" over the comments.",
      "Economist Stephen Moore, the co-founder of the conservative organization Club for Growth, announced Thursday that he is resigning from his Heritage Foundation position as senior visiting fellow after 12 years in the role. A source familiar with his decision pointed to the controversy over Roberts' defense of Carlson and the ensuing backlash.",
      "Fuentes has a history of incendiary comments",
      "Fuentes, who found popularity in the far-right movement in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has a history of making antisemetic, misogynistic and racist comments.",
      "The 27-year-old political commentator has claimed the Holocaust was \"exaggerated,\" \"a lot of women want to be raped\" and White people are \"justified\" in being racist.",
      "Fuentes and his far-right online followers, who refer to themselves as \"groypers,\" have existed on the fringes of right-wing politics. Mr. Trump hosted Fuentes and rapper Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022. But in an interview with \"Face the Nation\" in 2024, Vice President JD Vance disavowed Fuentes, who has questioned his loyalty to \"white identity,\" citing his interracial marriage.",
      "\"Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?\" Fuentes said.",
      "Vance responded on \"Face the Nation\" last year by calling Fuentes a \"total loser\" and saying his philosophy \"doesn't have any room in the MAGA movement.\"",
      "Fallout at Heritage over Roberts' defense of Carlson",
      "Roberts' comments drew condemnation from prominent conservatives like former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and commentator Ben Shapiro, who said the remarks \"betray the legacy of Heritage.\"",
      "On Oct. 31, in a lengthy post, Roberts elaborated on his comments about Fuentes, saying the Heritage Foundation denounces Fuentes' \"vicious antisemitic ideology, his Holocaust denial, and his relentless conspiracy theories that echo the darkest chapters of history\" and is \"disgusted\" by several of his other stances.",
      "\"Our task is to confront and challenge those poisonous ideas at every turn to prevent them from taking America to a very dark place. Join us \u2014 not to cancel \u2014 but to guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation, and be confident as I am that our best ideas at the heart of western civilization will prevail,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "This week, Roberts faced intense criticism during an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, according to video of the nearly two-hour event obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Some staff members called for Roberts' resignation and questioned his ability to continue to lead the organization.",
      "One attendee said she and others have no confidence in Roberts' leadership after the events of the last week and that he showed \"a stunning lack of both courage and judgment.\" Another attendee said \"enormous damage\" has been done to the Heritage Foundation's reputation.",
      "Roberts apologized while also blaming his now-former chief of staff for the original video, saying the former employee \"had the pen\" and had been made to believe that the script had been approved by a handful of other Heritage colleagues.",
      "\"I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution,\" Roberts said. \"And I am sorry for that. Period. Full stop.\"",
      "He also apologized for using the phrase \"venomous coalition,\" which is seen as an antisemitic trope, calling it \"a terrible choice of words.\"",

    "summary": "Mikie Sherrill flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters and won Latino men and women in her race for New Jersey governor.",
    "story": [
      "Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, largely reversing historic gains President Trump made in 2024 with this key demographic.",
      "Mr. Trump was a factor for voters generally, across Virginia, New Jersey, and California, according to CBS News exit polls \u2014 many said they voted in these races to oppose him.",
      "In New Jersey, 68% of Latino voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill, helping her defeat Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump. Sherrill carried Latino men and women alike, and even flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters.",
      "Every New Jersey county voted more Democratic than in the 2024 presidential election. And Democrats swept the 10 counties where Latinos make up at least 20% of the population, expanding on their 2024 margins and flipping counties that Mr. Trump won in 2024.",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump made significant inroads in heavily Latino cities like Passaic with a 70% Latino population. He increased his vote margin by over 30 points and flipped the county, becoming the first Republican to win the presidential vote there in over 30 years.",
      "This year, these communities swung hard the other way, reversing Republican gains. Passaic flipped back to the Democratic column, giving Sherrill the same vote share Joe Biden enjoyed there in 2020. And in both Paterson and heavily Latino Prospect Park, Sherrill did even better.",
      "\"The thing that stands out the most to me is the amount of swing from Republican to Democrat in just one year,\" said Chuck Rocha a Democratic political strategist and CBS News contributor. \"We saw the swing of Latinos to the right slowly, progressively over the last 10 to 12 years, but on Tuesday night it was a real snapback \u2014 almost back to pre-Trump numbers of Latino performances for Democrats.\"",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump received a higher percentage of the Latino vote than any other Republican presidential candidate in history. He won 46% of the Latino vote, coming very close to former Vice President Kamala Harris' vote share of 51%, according to CBS News exit polling. This was a dramatic improvement from Mr. Trump's showing of 28% in 2016.",
      "A precinct-level analysis of Passaic County reveals the types of places that shifted dramatically. About 16% of the county's precincts flipped from backing Mr. Trump last year to Sherrill this year, with no flips in the other direction.",
      "Moreover, it was areas with larger Latino populations that saw the biggest swings left. While some Latino Trump voters switched to vote Democratic this year, these shifts are also due to changes in turnout. Places with more Latinos saw greater churn in the electorate: that is, more of their 2024 voters skipped voting this year, and many of them were replaced with new voters who didn't vote last year (according to voter file data on this year's advance voters).",
      "Across the three cities mentioned above, along with Clifton, wards with more Latino residents both saw more churn and shifted more toward Democrats. Taken together, these data points and CBS News exit polling suggest that many of Trump's Latino voters stayed home, while others switched sides, and new voters broke heavily Democratic.",
      "In Virginia, Hispanic voters also swung for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who won 67% of their vote across the state. Mr. Trump made large gains in Manassas and Manassas Park in 2024, which are more than 40% Latino. In 2025, these two areas turned out for Spanberger.",
      "\"Certainly with the Latino community, economic issues, kitchen table issues, are always front of mind and always center in the decisions they're making,\" said Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin of the appeal of Democratic candidates to Latinos. \"You add on top of that, the fact that for many parts of this country, the Latino community has been terrorized with these mass thugs from ICE going out and indiscriminately pulling Latino from their cars.\"",
      "According to CBS News exit polls, 65% of Virginia Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their highest priority.",
      "In New Jersey, 57% of Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, and 53% feel the economy is not in good shape. On immigration, six in 10 Latinos feel the president's immigration actions have gone too far, and a similar number say the state's next governor should not cooperate with him.",
      "\"I predicted this was going to happen once the economy did not improve and once they started not deportation \u2014 but once they started deportations of non-criminal aliens and racial profiling \u2014 that there was gonna be a snapback,\" said Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who campaigned for both Spanberger and Sherrill.",
      "\"It's the same thing I saw in Arizona once there was racial profiling with Sheriff Joe Arpaio. You saw a mass mobilization of Latinos going out to not just protect themselves or protect their families,\" Gallego told CBS News, making reference to the former Maricopa County sheriff and anti-immigration hardliner. In 2024, Gallego won his U.S. Senate race, becoming Arizona's first Latino senator, as Mr. Trump won the state that year, largely on the strength of his outsized support from Latino male voters.",
      "In a recent UnidosUS bipartisan survey, 41% said they feared they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents, despite having legal status.",
      "\"Unfortunately Latinos are leaving the Republican party after giving us a monumental chance in 2024,\" GOP Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said in a video posted on X after Tuesday's elections. She called the results \"a wake up call\" for the Republicans.",
      "\"I've said it before, the Hispanic vote is not guaranteed: Hispanics married President Trump, but they're only dating the GOP,\" Salazar said.",
      "The president said Wednesday, \"I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" regarding the election results. \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.\"",
      "The 2025 races garnered national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about Mr. Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of the next year's pivotal midterm elections.",
      "Republicans have engaged in mid-decade redistricting in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, at the behest of Mr. Trump, trying to boost GOP chances of winning seats and retain control over the House of Representatives.",
      "In Texas, Republicans redrew five Democratic congressional districts \u2014 including two in South Texas that will be competitive in 2026. Former Republican Rep. Mayra Flores is running for one of the newly drawn seats, Congressional District 34, and says she hopes to compound Mr. Trump's 2024 historic gains.",
      "In a phone interview, she praised Mr. Trump's second term, but said, \"Our focus needs to continue on bringing down the cost of living and improving the economy because the American people are struggling to live.\"",
      "Flores says Latino voters in South Texas largely supported Mr. Trump in 2024 because they wanted more border security, and she believes the GOP will be able to hold onto their votes next year.",
      "In the 2025 fiscal year, which just ended in September, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, as a result of the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "\"We see firsthand what it looks like not to have law and order, and that is why Hispanics voted for President Trump,\" Flores said. \"We wanted law and order and continue to want law and order now more than ever.\"",

    "summary": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking a federal judge to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
      "The motion, which had been expected, argues the case against James was driven by personal \"animus\" that arose out of James' civil fraud lawsuit against President Trump and his companies in her capacity as state attorney general.",
      "\"This lawsuit, and AG James' outspoken criticism of the President, triggered six years of targeted attacks. President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state's attorney general,\" lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.",
      "The name-calling by Mr. Trump includes describing her as \"crooked,\" \"scum,\" \"a monster\" and \"criminal,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing is similar to one from another of Mr. Trump's perceived adversaries, former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Comey has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.",
      "James is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a \"tool of revenge.\"",
      "To bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny \"while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.\"",
      "They say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the alleged conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was accused of identifying three houses as his first home.",
      "\"The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Like Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who was named to the post by Mr. Trump after the resignation of former acting U.S. attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "After Siebert's resignation, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote that the administration \"can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" adding: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "Friday's court filing criticized Halligan's ascension to the job, writing that \"the President removed what he viewed as the final roadblock to his plan\u2014interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014and installed his own lawyer, Ms. Halligan, with the singular mission of churning out indictments against his political enemies. Ms. Halligan promptly obeyed.\"",
      "Comey and James are separately challenging their indictments on the grounds that Halligan was illegally named to her job.",
      "James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general.",
      "James has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump's, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Mr. Trump had committed fraud. Mr. Trump has denied all allegations against him.",

    "story": [
      "Congressional Democrats have written at least eight letters seeking information about President Trump's $300 million ballroom project. So far, those oversight requests have yielded few substantive responses from the administration and a nonprofit involved in the project.",
      "The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, received no response to his letter seeking architectural plans, budgets and a donor list, according to committee staffers.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff has been similarly ignored. His letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles regarding donors and ethics concerns went unanswered.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sought details around the ballroom's financing. In a letter to the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall, Warren requested the \"source and amount of any donations or pledges\" and questioned the ballooning cost of the project.",
      "Catherine Townsend, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, responded to Warren in a letter, explaining that the Trust \"is managing the private donations gifted to support the project,\" but it's not involved in the ballroom's planning or design.",
      "Townsend said the trust complies with federal nonprofit laws but \"donor names and identifying information are not subject to public disclosure\u2026and we strictly adhere to those confidentiality requirements to protect our donors' privacy.\"",
      "The National Park Service did not reply to Warren's inquiry, according to her office. Townsend referred further questions to the White House.",
      "\"If the Trust for the National Mall has become a tool for favor-seeking between billionaires and the President of the United States, the American people deserve to know,\" Warren said. \"I'll keep pushing to find out if the Trust is facilitating wink-and-nod arrangements between Trump and his billionaire ballroom donors \u2014 and what these donors are getting in return.\"",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power, so their letters amount to requests for information. The White House may volunteer information in response, but it's under no legal obligation to comply. It was not immediately clear whether the government shutdown has impacted the White House's ability to respond to congressional outreach.",
      "Last week, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and 59 House Democrats asked the White House to explain its efforts to preserve artifacts in the now-demolished East Wing.",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states Friday that it is working to comply with a federal judge's order to provide full food benefits to roughly 42 million Americans through November, an agency official said.",
      "Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in new guidance\u00a0issued to state agencies that the USDA is \"working towards implementing November 2025 full benefit issuances in compliance with\" an order from U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued Thursday.",
      "Penn said in the guidance that \"later today,\" the Trump administration \"will complete the processes necessary to make funds available\" to cover November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in full.",
      "The notification comes as the Justice Department has appealed the judge's order requiring the administration to provide full assistance to Americans who use the allotments to purchase groceries. The Justice Department has also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to block his order and requested a decision on its bid for emergency relief by 4 p.m.",
      "McConnell is overseeing a lawsuit brought by a group of cities and nonprofits after the USDA informed states late last month it would halt food assistance for November to Americans enrolled in the nutrition program because of the ongoing government shutdown. He\u00a0ordered the Trump administration\u00a0last week to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to SNAP recipients for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",
      "The plaintiffs then asked McConnell for additional relief that would require the Trump administration to make full SNAP payments \"immediately.\"",
      "In his latest decision, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot used for Child Nutrition programs \u2014 to do so.

      "With flight reductions beginning Friday at 40 major U.S. airports, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said safety is his top priority \u2014 but he declined to share information about the data that led to the decision to cut capacity.",
      "Airlines were ordered to reduce flights as air traffic control staffing grew increasingly strained during the\u00a0government shutdown, leading to intermittent ground stops.",
      "\"We had seen the rolling staffing triggers that come from air traffic controllers \u2014 one day it was L.A., another day it was in New York, Minneapolis, Atlanta \u2014 and so as we were looking at data, we were seeing increased numbers in some of the categories we don't like,\" Duffy told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday.",
      "\"As that data came in we decided to make the decisions we thought were appropriate,\" Duffy said.",
      "He would not give specifics about what the data showed, but said it will be provided to airlines and Congress at a future time.",
      "Later in the day, speaking at Reagan National Airport in Washington, Duffy indicated that some of those concerns included \"more breaches\" of the minimum distance kept between planes in the air and an increase in tarmac incursions.",
      "Airlines are expected to cut at least 4% of Friday's flights and ramp up to 10% by the end of next week if the shutdown continues. The cuts will impact everything from commercial travel to cargo and private jets \u2014 even space launches.",
      "\"My job is to be preemptive\"",
      "As the shutdown drags into its second month, Duffy said some air traffic controllers have been working 10-hour days, six days per week.",
      "\"That pressure on the controllers were giving us numbers that were not troubling, but were concerning. So my job is to be preemptive,\" he said.",
      "The air traffic controllers' union said the nation was already thousands of controllers short of what's needed before the shutdown. As employees continue to go without pay, there's been an increase in sick calls.",
      "Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, has called for more transparency as flights are slashed.",
      "\"If people want to question us, I would throw it back at them: open up the government,\" Duffy said. \"You know, we have to take unprecedented action because we're in an unprecedented situation with the shutdown.\"",
      "He said he worked with the FAA administrator and safety team on the plans.",
      "\"I have done all I can to minimize disruption in the airspace. I'm trying to get people where they want to go and get them there safely,\" he said.",
      "In its flight reduction order, the FAA said it would impose a $75,000 fine for every flight a carrier operates above government limits.",

      "\"President Trump has approved a pardon for Darryl Strawberry, three-time World Series champion and eight-time MLB All-Star,\" the White House official said. \"Mr. Strawberry served time and paid back taxes after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion. Following his career, Mr. Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for over a decade \u2014 he has become active in ministry and started a recovery center which still operates today.\"",
      "Strawberry played seven seasons with the Mets, from 1983-90, and helped lead the team to its 1986 World Series championship. He went on to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants before returning to New York for the Yankees. He hit .259 with 335 homers, 1,000 RBIs and 221 stolen bases in 17 seasons. He also struggled with drug and alcohol addiction that repeatedly derailed his career.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday pardoned former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his former chief of staff Cade Cothren, who were convicted on federal corruption charges.",
      "Casada, a Republican, was sentenced in September to three years in prison over a 2020 scheme to receive over $50,000 in taxpayer money from a mailer program for lawmakers. Prosecutors said Cothren, with support from Casada, listed a fake name on tax documents for a political consulting firm that received the funds. Cothren was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.",
      "\"The defendants abused their power as government officials and defrauded taxpayers for their own enrichment,\" Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division,\u00a0said\u00a0after the September sentencing. \"The Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who betray public trust.\"",
      "But the White House said Friday that the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden had \"significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue involving constituent mailers \u2014 which were billed at competitive prices, never received a complaint from legislators, and resulted in a net profit loss of less than $5,000.\"",
      "Casada's attorney Ed Yarbough said he was still waiting for the pardon paperwork, but Mr. Trump had called Casada on Thursday to give him the news that he would be granted a full pardon. The call came days before Casada was supposed to report to prison to serve his sentence.",
      "Casada resigned as speaker in 2019 amid multiple scandals that were not related to the corruption charges, including reports he had exchanged sexually explicit texts about women with Cothren.",
      "Cothren resigned shortly before Casada, after sexual, racist and drug-fueled texts he had sent were published by News Channel 5 in Nashville and other outlets. He also admitted\u00a0that he had used cocaine in a state legislative office building while in a previous job.",
      "During his second term, Mr. Trump has pardoned several Republican lawmakers who were convicted of fraud or corruption. In mid-October, he commuted the sentence\u00a0of former New York Rep. George Santos, who was serving over seven years in prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In May 2025, Mr. Trump pardoned former New York Rep.

      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin introduced a bill Friday to restore funding for Head Start programs during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "\"My bill would give families certainty that Head Start and the care it provides will continue,\" Baldwin said in a statement provided exclusively to CBS News. \"If my Republican colleagues don't want to sit down and talk about saving 22 million Americans from skyrocketing health care costs, I hope they can at least agree that 750,000 children and their families shouldn't pay the price for Washington dysfunction.\"",
      "The Keep Head Start Funding Act of 2025 would ensure that programs could keep operating even if Congress hasn't passed new appropriations bills. It would retroactively take effect from Sept. 30 \u2014 immediately before government funding lapsed and the shutdown began.",
      "At least 140 Head Start programs, serving 65,000 children, have not received federal funding to renew grants in October or early November, according to the National Head Start Association. As of Nov. 1, the organization says 20 programs have partially or fully closed as a result of the shutdown, affecting nearly 10,000 children.",

      "This month, the Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program\u00a0shuttered its Head Start program, impacting more than 300 children. Even if the shutdown ends, Head Start director Tawny Hardyman told CBS News she expects the program could remain closed through the end of the year.",
      "\"My main concern is for the well being of the children and families,\" Hardyman explained. \"Once they come to their resolution, then the federal workers that support the Head Start grants have to be recalled back to work and they have to process our applications.\"",
      "\"What we have told staff is to be prepared, possibly through the rest of this calendar year until December 31st,\" she said.",
      "Other programs have been granted a temporary reprieve. In Tallahassee, Florida, the Capital Area Community Action Agency has relied on donations and a patchwork of support from local schools and churches to keep most of its Head Start programs afloat through mid-November. Once that is exhausted, the program, which has 378 children enrolled, could be forced to close.",
      "\"As far as having the money to run the operation, pay employees, things of that nature, we won't have that,\" said Head Start director Darrel James.",
      "James welcomed news of Baldwin's bill, given the uncertainty of the government funding impasse, now in its 38th day.",

      "\"The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr. Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,\" said the letter, which was signed by the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, and 14 others.",
      "\"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation. In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you cooperate with the Committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the Committee,\" the American lawmakers said.",
      "Neither Garcia nor the committee has the power to subpoena Andrew, who was formally stripped of the title of prince on Thursday.",
      "No Republicans on the House committee signed the letter.",
      "The communication cited Andrew's widely reported friendship with Epstein, which continued after the American financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution. It also mentioned Andrew's visits to Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Epstein's trip to the late Queen Elizabeth II's residence at Balmoral in Scotland.",
      "\"This close relationship with Mr. Epstein, coupled with the recently revealed 2011 email exchange in which you wrote to him 'we are in this together,' further confirms our suspicion that you may have valuable information about the crimes committed by Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators,\" the letter said.",
      "It also cited a number of allegations by the late Virginia Giuffre, including that she was \"lent out\" to Andrew by Epstein on a number of occasions.",
      "\"In response to a subpoena issued to the Epstein estate, the Committee has identified financial records containing notations such as \"massage for Andrew\" that raise serious questions regarding the nature of your relationship with Mr. Epstein and related financial transactions,\" the letter said.",
      "The House Democrats also mentioned Giuffre's memoir, which was published posthumously this year, in which she mentioned her fear of Andrew retaliating if she publicized allegations against him.",
      "\"This fear of retaliation has been a persistent obstacle to many of those who were victimized in their fight for justice. In addition to Mr. Epstein's crimes, we are investigating any such efforts to silence, intimidate, or threaten victims, and are interested in any avenues that may further shed light on these activities,\" the letter said.",
      "Andrew was asked to respond to the letter by Nov. 20th, \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter.\"",
      "He was stripped of both his \"Royal Highness\" and \"prince\" titles on Thursday, and last month he gave up other royal titles, including \"Duke of York.\"",
      "He had already stepped down from public duties as a member of the royal family in 2019, after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "After allowing his younger brother to slowly and voluntarily give up his royal honors for months, King Charles III announced abruptly on October 30 \u2014 after more revelations about Andrew's past ties to Epstein \u2014 that he would be deprived of the titles and evicted from his long-time, 30-bedroom mansion on the Windsor estate.",

      "Washington \u2014 A Rhode Island judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to provide full federal food benefits\u00a0to states by Friday and admonished the government for what he said is its defiance of an earlier order.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell told Justice Department lawyers that it is \"simply unacceptable\" to wait any longer before providing the full payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and instead said the administration should act swiftly.",
      "\"Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,\" McConnell said. \"This should never happen in America.\"",
      "The judge granted a request from municipalities and nonprofit organizations to order the administration to provide the full food benefits. He declined to pause his decision, arguing that \"people have gone without for too long.\"",
      "McConnell also accused the Trump administration of withholding SNAP benefits \"for political reasons,\" citing statements by President Trump earlier this week, in which he said the food stamp funds would only be released \"when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "The White House clarified that it is\u00a0complying with an earlier order\u00a0from McConnell that required the Trump administration to tap into a contingency fund to provide partial SNAP benefits for November. The USDA notified states late last month that the food aid would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown, which\u00a0entered its 37th day\u00a0Thursday.",
      "The Justice Department quickly appealed McConnell's order and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to freeze the district court's decision. Justice Department lawyers said his ruling \"makes a mockery of the separation of powers.\"",
      "\"There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,\" they wrote in their request\u00a0for emergency relief.",
      "Administration officials have said there is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November SNAP payments and fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion.",
      "Vice President JD Vance called the ruling \"absurd\" at an unrelated White House event Thursday evening.",
      "\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\" Vance said.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the municipalities and nonprofits, praised the decision from McConnell, calling it a \"major victory\" for the 42 million Americans who receive food aid.",
      "\"The court could not be more clear \u2014 the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people's lives by delaying SNAP payments they are obligated to issue,\" she said in a statement.",
      "In a written decision, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to dip into the contingency fund as well as a different pot of money created by Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935 to make full payments of November SNAP benefits. That account is funded by a percentage of customs receipts\u00a0on imports from the prior calendar year and aims to support producers of certain agricultural commodities. It had more than\u00a0$23 billion in it as of Oct. 9, according to the White House budget office.",
      "The judge wrote that as of Thursday, SNAP recipients haven't received their benefits for the month, and he said the Trump administration knew that pulling from the contingency fund to provide food benefits would prolong their disbursement.",
      "Administration officials \"overlook the fundamental point that compliance is achieved when Americans are fed, not when the federal government shifts the administrative burden of disbursing funds onto the States \u2014 especially when there is still no clear disbursement date in sight,\" McConnell said.",
      "He also accused the Trump administration of \"withholding full SNAP benefits for political purposes\" and pointed to social media comments from Mr. Trump about the payments.",
      "The Justice Department told the court earlier this week that the USDA would comply with McConnell's earlier decision and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds.\" A USDA official overseeing SNAP said in a declaration Monday that roughly $4.6 billion in reserve money would be used to cover 50% of eligible households' allotments.",
      "The agency \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November,\" the official, Patrick Penn, said.",
      "He then told the court in a filing earlier Thursday that benefits will actually be reduced by 35% instead of halved after the USDA conducted further calculations. As a result, eligible Americans will receive up to 65% of their benefits, more than the initial 50% that states had been directed to implement earlier this week.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-rural-health-fund-concerns-fairness-access/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 05:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Amid public forums and local cries for help, states are also talking with large health systems, technology companies, and others amid intensifying competition for shares of a $50 billion fund to improve rural health.",
    "story": [
      "Echo Kopplin wants South Dakota's leaders to know that money from a new $50 billion federal rural health fund should help residents with limited transportation options.",
      "Kopplin, a physician assistant who works with seniors, low-income people, and mental health patients in the rural Black Hills, shared her thoughts at a meeting hosted by state officials.",
      "South Dakota's leaders did a \"good job of diving in\" and asking questions to get \"deeper at the root of the problem,\" she said.",
      "Kopplin later told KFF Health News how one of her rural patients recently missed two appointments because of a broken-down car and no access to public transportation.",
      "Nationwide, health care workers like Kopplin and thousands of others \u2014 from patient advocates to technology executives \u2014 flocked to town halls or online portals during the seven weeks state leaders had to craft and submit their applications for the Rural Health Transformation Program to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That deadline was Nov. 5.",
      "\"We will give $50 billion away by the end of the year,\" CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said Nov. 6 at a Milken Institute event in Washington. He said all 50 states had submitted applications.",
      "The program will \"allow us to right-size the health care system,\" Oz said, adding that innovations from the rural work \"will spill over to suburban and urban America as well.\"",
      "Among applications and summaries publicly shared by states, themes include workforce development, telehealth, and access to healthy food. In Kansas, leaders want to build a \"Food is Medicine\" program. Wyoming officials propose a new program called \"BearCare,\" a state-sponsored health insurance plan that patients could use only after medical emergencies.",
      "But many health policy experts and Democrats are raising alarms that the Republican-backed program will become a \"slush fund.\" Critics worry it will fail to reach the small-town patients they say need it most, especially as states face nearly a trillion dollars in Medicaid spending reductions over the next decade. Medicaid, a joint federal-state program, serves nearly 1 in 4 rural Americans.",
      "\"The status quo is tremendous distress in rural communities,\" said Heather Howard, a professor of the practice at Princeton University and director of the university's State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund. The new funding won't be enough to offset the Medicaid losses, she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans added the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to President Donald Trump's massive tax-and-spending legislation. The move helped win support for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act from conservative holdouts who worried that the Medicaid cuts in the bill would harm rural hospitals in their states.",
      "In Montana, which hosted an online public forum before submitting its application, a nonprofit director pitched youth peer support as a way of battling high suicide rates. A registered nurse asked state leaders to \"think maybe even bigger\" and consider statewide universal health care.",
      "And in Georgia, a technology-focused chain of primary care clinics that serves seniors proposed expanding its operations into that state in its online public comment. A rural grant writer asked for \"safe and stable housing.\"",
      "The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be doled out according to a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "Top Senate Democrats have raised alarms about the rural health program. They include Ron Wyden of Oregon and Tina Smith of Minnesota, who called on a federal watchdog agency to investigate the fairness and implementation of the fund. Taylor Harvey, a Wyden aide, said the Government Accountability Office has confirmed it will investigate.",
      "According to the federal statute, no less than a quarter of states with an approved application may share the second half of the funding each fiscal year, CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said. The agency plans to publish summaries of approved state projects, according to CMS guidance.",
      "A handful of conservative-leaning states \u2014 including Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma \u2014 have already instituted regulatory and legislative initiatives, such as prohibiting \"non-nutritious\" foods in benefit programs, that garner additional points in the program application process.",
      "Michael Chameides, a county supervisor in rural New York, said he fears the money could \"be used in ways that would hurt certain states or reward certain states.\" Chameides is also the communications and policy director with the Rural Democracy Initiative, a national advocacy organization that released a rural action report last month.",
      "Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, said federal lawmakers gave Oz and his agency \"really excessive discretion\" when awarding the money.",
      "Federal administrators have added rules that aren't within the statute that created the program, Park said. For example, its application guidelines say states cannot use more than 15% of their funding to pay providers for patient care \u2014 payments that are expected to take a hit due to the Medicaid cuts.",
      "Georgetown's health policy experts and Democrats aren't the only ones with concerns. Some Republicans and small hospitals in Ohio worry the money will go to large health systems instead of smaller, independent hospitals that serve people within their rural communities.",
      "CMS' Oz repeated the idea of getting \"big hospitals to adopt smaller institutions\" at the Washington gathering after applications were filed. He used similar language at a rural health summit hosted by South Dakota-based Sanford Health. \"How do we get big hospitals to adopt smaller hospitals? Not to take them over, but to keep them viable by giving them good telehealth services, specialty support, radiology support,\" he said at the October event.",
      "Sanford owns or manages dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics and long-term care centers, as well as a health insurance company. The system reported about $81 million in operating income during the first six months of fiscal year 2025, according to a recent bond rating report.",
      "Last year, Sanford opened a \"command center\" for its systemwide telehealth initiative. It launched a telehealth expansion in 2021 and offers virtual care for 78 medical specialties, Sanford President and CEO Bill Gassen said.",
      "\"We've tried to imagine, what if that number doubles?\" Gassen said. The startup costs for telehealth are high, he said, and the rural fund could be a unique opportunity \"for us to make virtual care available to more patients, to more communities, to more hospitals and health systems across the country.\"",
      "Gassen, who is set to chair the American Hospital Association in 2027, said Sanford leaders have met with state and federal officials, including Oz, whom he's known for years, and Chris Klomp, a top deputy at CMS and a senior adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The word \"telehealth\" appears 36 times in the rural health program's 124-page application guidelines. But Don Robbins Jr., chief executive of a small hospital on the Illinois-Kentucky border, chuckled at the idea of using the funding for that purpose.",
      "Robbins, whose 25-bed Massac Memorial Hospital averages five to seven patients in its beds each day, said his hospital does not regularly offer telehealth. Even if it did, he said, patients living more than a mile outside of town couldn't use it because they don't have a good internet connection.",
      "The small hospital reported a $31,314 loss in September, Robbins said. \"I think if we get anything out of it,\" Robbins said of the rural health program, \"we'll be lucky.\"",
      "Kopplin, the physician assistant who attended the South Dakota meeting, is cautiously optimistic about the rural health fund. She views it as a wonderful chance for states to test out ideas and learn from what works and what doesn't.",
      "But \"in a lot of ways this bill is going to be a band-aid approach\" for rural health, she said. \"It's not really going to fix the problem.\"",

    "story": [
      "Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a Thursday directive from the Trump administration.",
      "The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" \u2014 a potential drain on U.S. resources \u2014 because of their health issues or age.",
      "While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases like tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status.",
      "The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.",
      "The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.",
      "\"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions \u2014 including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions \u2014 can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\"",
      "About 10% of the world's population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's leading killer.",
      "The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, like obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.",
      "\"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.",
      "Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.",
      "\"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads.",
      "The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said.",
      "The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\"",
      "The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.",
      "\"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks.",
      "Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy.",
      "They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.",
      "But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.",
      "\"Taking into consideration one's diabetic history or heart health history \u2014 that's quite expansive,\" Genovese said. \"There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite expansive as opining over, 'What if someone goes into diabetic shock?' If this change is going to happen immediately, that's obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.\"",

      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that the two world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drug \u2014 I call it the fat drug, remember \u2014 at drastic discounts,\" the president announced in the Oval Office.",
      "Under the deal, Eli Lilly, the maker of Zepbound, and Novo Nordisk, the company behind Ozempic and Wegovy, have agreed to lower the price of their weight loss drugs for eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and for eligible users of the\u00a0planned \"TrumpRx\" pharmaceutical website.",
      "The price per month for most eligible people will be $245 to $350 a month on average, administration officials said. The cost for the drug now is as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "\"You think it was easy dealing with these people? It wasn't,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to pharmaceutical company executives. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said this agreement took \"months and months\" of negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also agreed to provide all their other medications at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning Americans will pay a competitively low price like the consumers in other countries do.",
      "The Oval Office event was cut short when one of the company attendees fainted, and members of the press were ushered out of the room. \"The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",

      "Details of the weight loss drug price deal",
      "TrumpRx, which is expected to launch as early as the end of this year, will allow customers to buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies without going through insurance.",
      "When purchased through TrumpRx, the cost will be around $350 per month for injections of Ozempic and Wegovy, officials told reporters on a briefing call. The new pricing will go into effect in January.",

      "About 40% of Americans are obese, according to CDC data, though a recent survey suggests the rate has started to decline. Research shows obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States.",
      "\"This is not about losing weight \u2014 this is about making America healthy again,\" said another official on the call. \"This is about preventing strokes, this is about preventing end-stage renal disease. So, given that, we are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it.\"",
      "Other prescription drug websites, such as GoodRx, won't be partnering with TrumpRx, administration officials told CBS News. Pharmaceutical companies will decide how to fulfill consumers' orders \u2014 via their own in-house logistics or by partnering with a third-party platform, one official said.",
      "The administration announced plans for the TrumpRx initiative earlier this fall, and has struck deals with several other major pharmaceutical companies. But some analysts say the \"most-favored-nation\" pricing being promised could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously floated the possibility of lower prices for weight loss drugs and expressed dismay about the high costs.",
      "\"I call it the fat pill or the fat drug,\" he said at an event on drug prices in September. \"Sometimes it works, I guess, for people. The ones I've seen, it hasn't worked so well. I've got a lot of friends, they're fat. They said, 'Yeah, I lost some weight.' I said, 'Yeah, don't look it to me.'\"",
      "Kennedy said the administration is also working to get healthier foods into schools and the military, and to increase physical activity in schools. The administration expects to release new dietary guidelines soon, Kennedy said.",
      "\"In the meantime, there is nothing more important that we can do than lower this price,\" Kennedy said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing a new passport policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to enforce for now its policy ending the use of the \"X\" marker on passports and requiring the documents to reflect the passport-holder's \"biological sex at birth.\"",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing the policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year. The injunction allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared to split 6-3 in the decision, with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "\"Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth \u2014 in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,\" the court said in an unsigned decision. \"And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex 'lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'\"",
      "The court said in its order that the Trump administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and wrote that the district court's decision to provide broad relief blocks enforcement of an executive branch policy \"with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.\"",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the harms to the plaintiffs challenging the new rules outweigh the government's interest in immediately implementing the passport policy.",
      "Without relief, transgender Americans \"are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other,\" Jackson wrote. \"The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice \u2014 before their legal challenges have even been resolved \u2014 is palpable.\"",
      "She was joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the district court in Massachusetts interfered with the president's exercise of his foreign policy powers with its June ruling. It also said it has been the government's policy since 1977 \u2014 with the exception of during the Biden administration \u2014 to not allow passport applicants to self-select their preferred sex designation.",
      "\"Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex \u2014 especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive reversed a policy adopted by the Biden administration that let passport applicants choose their sex marker on the document based on their gender identity and added the \"X\" marker as an option for those who are nonbinary or don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "The president's measure defined \"sex\" as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively stopping applicants from choosing a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the \"X\" marker and changed applications to offer only the \"M\" or \"F\" designations. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought a court order that required the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy and allow them to self-attest as to their sex, including by selecting the \"X\" marker.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued a temporary order in April siding with the plaintiffs, finding in part that the State Department \"failed to offer a reasoned explanation\" for the new passport policy. Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, also ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and discriminates based on sex.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group \u2014 transgender Americans \u2014 who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her decision.",
      "In June, she extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who would seek a new passport that reflected a sex designation aligning with their gender identity or wanted a passport with the \"X\" designation.",
      "Kobick required the Trump administration to allow those passport applicants to self-select a sex marker \u2014 including the \"X\" designation \u2014 that corresponds with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected the administration's request.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He wrote that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking the plan's enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",
      "\"The question is whether the Constitution requires the government to adopt respondents' preferred definition of sex. It does not,\" Sauer wrote, adding that the passport policy defines sex in terms of biology, not self-identification.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, however, said the State Department has for decades allowed changes to passport sex markers to align with the applicant's gender identity.",
      "\"By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives Plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",

      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",

      "What to know on Day 38 of the government shutdown:",
      "Senate Democrats offered on Friday to end the government shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of health care tax credits and a plan to continue broader talks, a proposal that was swiftly rejected by Republicans, who grew increasingly frustrated with their colleagues over the course of the day.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out the Democratic proposal on the Senate floor in the afternoon. He said Democrats would back a bill to quickly reopen the government if it included the one-year extension of tax credits to bring down the cost of health insurance premiums.GOP senators rejected the offer out of hand. Majority Leader John Thune told CBS News it was a \"nonstarter\" that \"doesn't even get close.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called it \"terrible\" and \"political terrorism.\"The path forward in the Senate remains unclear.

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 22:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "In late September, President Trump announced he would be deploying federal troops to Portland in response to downtown protests over the administration's immigration crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday issued a ruling \"permanently\" blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.",
      "In late September, President Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0he would be deploying federal troops to Portland in response to downtown protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility over the administration's immigration crackdown. The Trump administration later placed 200 Oregon National Guard troops under federal control, and attempted to deploy another 200 federalized California National Guard troops in Portland\u00a0as well.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked Title 10 of the federal code in his deployment efforts, which allows for its use if the president deems that \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\"",
      "The moves\u00a0prompted a lawsuit\u00a0from city and state officials in Portland, Oregon and California.",
      "In her 106-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote that \"this Court arrives at the necessary conclusion that there was neither 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion' nor was the President 'unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States' in Oregon when he ordered the federalization and deployment of the National Guard.\"",
      "The ruling, however, will allow the National Guard troops to remain under federal control for a period of at least 14 days.",
      "\"President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,\" Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Friday night in response to the ruling. \"The President's lawful actions will make Portland safer.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Friday night in a statement: \"The facts haven't changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.\"",
      "In her own statement, Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said, \"This ruling, now the fourth of its kind, validates the facts on the ground. Oregon does not want or need military intervention, and President Trump's attempts to federalize the guard is a gross abuse of power. Oregon National Guard members have been away from their jobs and families for 38 days. The California National Guard has been here for just over one month. Based on this ruling, I am renewing my call to the Trump Administration to send all troops home now.\"",
      "Under Title 10, the \"president may call into federal service members and units of the National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws,\" in the event that \"the United States, or any of the commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States; or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The latest decision comes after Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, issued a 16-page ruling Sunday temporarily barring the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland following a three-day trial in which she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control.",
      "Immergut had said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "\"After a three-day trial that included the testimony of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials and hundreds of exhibits describing protest activity outside the Portland ICE building, the evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon's governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the President's authority,\" Immergut wrote Friday.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday appealed the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by the 9th Circuit court. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",

    "summary": "A new documentary, \"Second Wind,\" highlights Ukraine's wounded veterans, following four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro.",
    "story": [
      "As Ukraine's war with Russia grinds into its fourth year, the country is contending with a staggering toll of wounded soldiers and civilians \u2014 and an emerging generation of amputees reshaping what survival looks like in a nation under siege.",
      "A new documentary highlighting the country's wounded veterans screened this week at the French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C. The film, \"Second Wind,\" follows four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, all severely wounded in combat, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro \u2014 an account of grit and perseverance that comes amid one of the largest waves of war-related amputations in modern European history, and that mirrors the country's struggle to rise out of conflict.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that around 380,000 Ukrainian troops have been wounded since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. International medical organizations estimate that between 20,000 and 50,000 Ukrainians \u2014 including soldiers and civilians \u2014 have undergone amputations, with the World Health Organization saying the total number could approach 100,000.",
      "The scale and severity of those injuries have put enormous strain on Ukraine's medical and rehabilitation systems, with hospitals and prosthetic centers operating well beyond capacity.",
      "Filmed by Kyiv-born director Masha Kondakova, \"Second Wind\" documents the physical and psychological rehabilitation of soldiers injured by mines, artillery fire and drone strikes before they undertook their climb up Africa's highest peak. Kondakova, who began filming on the front lines of the conflict in 2014, said she wanted to focus not on the war itself but on what follows survival.",
      "\"We didn't want to make a movie about the war,\" Kondakova said in an interview with CBS News at the embassy of Ukraine in Washington. \"That was not the purpose at all. It's about our simple people, simple guys and one girl who became heroes because they're constantly overcoming their personal limits.\"",
      "\"Just take one step, and you will find your second wind. Maybe not with the first step \u2014 but with the second, you will,\" she said.",
      "Kondakova, who previously directed award-winning films about Ukraine's female soldiers and de-occupied zones near Kyiv, said \"Second Wind\" completes a trilogy about resilience. \"My first movie was about women at war at a moment when women didn't have positions in the army as fighters, and then a short, fictional movie about youth stolen by the war,\" she said. \"This third one \u2014 from the trenches in the east of Ukraine to the summit of Kilimanjaro \u2014 is about the resilience of our defenders. About how our scars become our strength.\"",
      "Among them is Mykhailo Matviiv, a soldier who lost a leg to a Russian airstrike and has since returned to the front lines to work as a drone operator on the eastern front. In an interview alongside Kondakova, he said returning to the front was not a question of choice.",
      "\"I can't live a normal life while my brothers are still at the front,\" he said, through translation. \"The injury created some doubts because I don't want to hold anybody back. But this experience showed me I can still be helpful and useful, as if the injury were not there.\"",
      "Matviiv, who applied his own tourniquet when he was wounded, said he had witnessed enemy forces intentionally target one soldier in order to attract medics or evacuation teams, only to then strike a bigger group.",
      "He added that the film's purpose was not to seek pity but to motivate. \"It's to show that life doesn't end with an injury,\" he said. \"You just climb your own personal summit, step by step.\"",
      "The documentary has already been shown in Ukrainian military hospitals, where Kondakova recalls one of the most emotional moments of her career.",
      "\"We were downstairs in a top secret [bunker] because otherwise we could be a target,\" she said. \"I was sitting behind one of our defenders, very young, who had just had this experience of amputation but no prosthesis yet.\"",
      "\"People were crying or so emotional,\" she said, \"I had a feeling they were with [the film's subjects] for each joke, they laughed as if they were together.\"",
      "Ukraine's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Olha Stefanishyna, said at the screening in Washington that the film was an important reminder for Americans in particular of the value of continued U.S. support for Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "\"It is very important to me that Americans can see what the true spirit of freedom is, and why their support matters,\" Stefanishyna said. \"This film shows that our Ukrainians \u2014 despite losing their legs \u2014 continued to fight, and they carried that spirit to the top of Kilimanjaro.\"",
      "The film arrives as Ukraine faces a long-term rehabilitation crisis. The Ministry of Health has said demand for prosthetics, particularly bionic limbs, has gone up sharply since the start of the war. Medical facilities such as Superhumans Center in Lviv \u2014 one of the country's most advanced prosthetics facilities \u2014 are operating at full capacity, while thousands of soldiers remain on waiting lists.",
      "Kondakova and her team have since launched The Second Wind Project, an organization designed to connect amputees through sports and peer support. \"We want every wounded soldier to feel the shoulder of a brother-in-arms,\" she said.",
      "She said she hopes \"Second Wind\" can also help raise awareness among policymakers and potential donors. \"The process of prosthetics and rehabilitation is long and expensive,\" she said. \"We need not only money, but expertise \u2014 veterans, doctors, specialists who can share experience.\"",
      "For Matviiv, who said after the film's U.S. screenings he will return again to the front near Pokrovsk, where some of the most intense fighting of the war continues, the message is straightforward. \"We are still fighting,\" he said. \"Any limitations that we have, we keep going and we keep defending.\"",
      "\"Second Wind\" continues an international tour this month, with screenings scheduled in New York, London, and Paris.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:38:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The cockpit voice recorder captured a persistent bell that began about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, and the bell continued until the recording ended, an NTSB official said.",
    "story": [
      "A repeating bell sounded in the cockpit for 25 seconds as pilots tried to control a UPS cargo plane that caught fire, had an engine fall off and crashed during takeoff this week in Louisville, Kentucky, a National Transportation Safety Board member said Friday. The crash\u00a0killed at least 14 people, including the three pilots on board.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured a persistent bell that began about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, and the bell continued until the recording ended, which investigators believe was the final point of impact, NTSB member Todd Inman said.",
      "Inman said there could be different types of alarms with varying meanings, but investigators know there was a fire in the plane's left wing and will use flight data to help determine a clearer picture of what happened.",
      "The NTSB is leading the investigation. Inman said it would be months before the transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, told The Associated Press the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The AP after Inman's news conference Friday. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. ... They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "The crash happened Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company's global aviation hub in Louisville. Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators visual evidence of what happened from many different angles.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg reported Friday evening on social media that another body was found at the crash site, bringing the \"total number of known fatalities\" to at least 14.",
      "UPS on Thursday identified the three pilots who were on board the plane as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.",
      "Bob Travis, president of the Independent Pilots Association, which represented the crew on the UPS flight, told CBS News on Friday that he knew two of the pilots personally. \"These were highly trained professionals,\" Travis said. \"...You're not flying a wide-body aircraft around the world for UPS unless you have a lot of experience.\"",
      "Travis said his organization is working with NTSB investigators, but says he has no doubt the crew did everything they could to prevent this outcome.  \"Our training is robust,\" Travis said. \"Repeatedly, you are facing what it's like to fly the aircraft if you're missing an engine, or in some cases, two. As we witnessed on the video there, to me looked instantaneous, and it looked catastrophic.\"",
      "Travis said it's his \"belief\" that, given the circumstances, there was not much the pilots could have done.",
      "\"That's my belief,\" Travis said. \"It looked like a pretty, pretty hard situation to overcome.\"",
      "CBS News has learned that among those killed in the crash was Louisnes Fedon and his 3-year-old granddaughter, Kimberly Asa.",
      "Matt Sweets, a father of two, was pulled out of the wreckage, but later died at a hospital, CBS News learned.",
      "Angie Anderso, 45, is among nine people still missing, CBS News also learned. Friends believe she was at a scrap metal recycling facility when the plane crashed into it.",
      "Travis said the union will continue to stand with the survivors and victims' families.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/latino-voters-swing-toward-democrats-in-2025-after-trumps-2024-historic-gains/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:55:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Mikie Sherrill flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters and won Latino men and women in her race for New Jersey governor.",
    "story": [
      "Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, largely reversing historic gains President Trump made in 2024 with this key demographic.",
      "Mr. Trump was a factor for voters generally, across Virginia, New Jersey, and California, according to CBS News exit polls \u2014 many said they voted in these races to oppose him.",
      "In New Jersey, 68% of Latino voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill, helping her defeat Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump. Sherrill carried Latino men and women alike, and even flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters.",
      "Every New Jersey county voted more Democratic than in the 2024 presidential election. And Democrats swept the 10 counties where Latinos make up at least 20% of the population, expanding on their 2024 margins and flipping counties that Mr. Trump won in 2024.",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump made significant inroads in heavily Latino cities like Passaic with a 70% Latino population. He increased his vote margin by over 30 points and flipped the county, becoming the first Republican to win the presidential vote there in over 30 years.",
      "This year, these communities swung hard the other way, reversing Republican gains. Passaic flipped back to the Democratic column, giving Sherrill the same vote share Joe Biden enjoyed there in 2020. And in both Paterson and heavily Latino Prospect Park, Sherrill did even better.",
      "\"The thing that stands out the most to me is the amount of swing from Republican to Democrat in just one year,\" said Chuck Rocha a Democratic political strategist and CBS News contributor. \"We saw the swing of Latinos to the right slowly, progressively over the last 10 to 12 years, but on Tuesday night it was a real snapback \u2014 almost back to pre-Trump numbers of Latino performances for Democrats.\"",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump received a higher percentage of the Latino vote than any other Republican presidential candidate in history. He won 46% of the Latino vote, coming very close to former Vice President Kamala Harris' vote share of 51%, according to CBS News exit polling. This was a dramatic improvement from Mr. Trump's showing of 28% in 2016.",
      "A precinct-level analysis of Passaic County reveals the types of places that shifted dramatically. About 16% of the county's precincts flipped from backing Mr. Trump last year to Sherrill this year, with no flips in the other direction.",
      "Moreover, it was areas with larger Latino populations that saw the biggest swings left. While some Latino Trump voters switched to vote Democratic this year, these shifts are also due to changes in turnout. Places with more Latinos saw greater churn in the electorate: that is, more of their 2024 voters skipped voting this year, and many of them were replaced with new voters who didn't vote last year (according to voter file data on this year's advance voters).",
      "Across the three cities mentioned above, along with Clifton, wards with more Latino residents both saw more churn and shifted more toward Democrats. Taken together, these data points and CBS News exit polling suggest that many of Trump's Latino voters stayed home, while others switched sides, and new voters broke heavily Democratic.",
      "In Virginia, Hispanic voters also swung for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who won 67% of their vote across the state. Mr. Trump made large gains in Manassas and Manassas Park in 2024, which are more than 40% Latino. In 2025, these two areas turned out for Spanberger.",
      "\"Certainly with the Latino community, economic issues, kitchen table issues, are always front of mind and always center in the decisions they're making,\" said Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin of the appeal of Democratic candidates to Latinos. \"You add on top of that, the fact that for many parts of this country, the Latino community has been terrorized with these mass thugs from ICE going out and indiscriminately pulling Latino from their cars.\"",
      "According to CBS News exit polls, 65% of Virginia Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their highest priority.",
      "In New Jersey, 57% of Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, and 53% feel the economy is not in good shape. On immigration, six in 10 Latinos feel the president's immigration actions have gone too far, and a similar number say the state's next governor should not cooperate with him.",
      "\"I predicted this was going to happen once the economy did not improve and once they started not deportation \u2014 but once they started deportations of non-criminal aliens and racial profiling \u2014 that there was gonna be a snapback,\" said Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who campaigned for both Spanberger and Sherrill.",
      "\"It's the same thing I saw in Arizona once there was racial profiling with Sheriff Joe Arpaio. You saw a mass mobilization of Latinos going out to not just protect themselves or protect their families,\" Gallego told CBS News, making reference to the former Maricopa County sheriff and anti-immigration hardliner. In 2024, Gallego won his U.S. Senate race, becoming Arizona's first Latino senator, as Mr. Trump won the state that year, largely on the strength of his outsized support from Latino male voters.",
      "In a recent UnidosUS bipartisan survey, 41% said they feared they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents, despite having legal status.",
      "\"Unfortunately Latinos are leaving the Republican party after giving us a monumental chance in 2024,\" GOP Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said in a video posted on X after Tuesday's elections. She called the results \"a wake up call\" for the Republicans.",
      "\"I've said it before, the Hispanic vote is not guaranteed: Hispanics married President Trump, but they're only dating the GOP,\" Salazar said.",
      "The president said Wednesday, \"I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" regarding the election results. \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.\"",
      "The 2025 races garnered national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about Mr. Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of the next year's pivotal midterm elections.",
      "Republicans have engaged in mid-decade redistricting in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, at the behest of Mr. Trump, trying to boost GOP chances of winning seats and retain control over the House of Representatives.",
      "In Texas, Republicans redrew five Democratic congressional districts \u2014 including two in South Texas that will be competitive in 2026. Former Republican Rep. Mayra Flores is running for one of the newly drawn seats, Congressional District 34, and says she hopes to compound Mr. Trump's 2024 historic gains.",
      "In a phone interview, she praised Mr. Trump's second term, but said, \"Our focus needs to continue on bringing down the cost of living and improving the economy because the American people are struggling to live.\"",
      "Flores says Latino voters in South Texas largely supported Mr. Trump in 2024 because they wanted more border security, and she believes the GOP will be able to hold onto their votes next year.",
      "In the 2025 fiscal year, which just ended in September, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, as a result of the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "\"We see firsthand what it looks like not to have law and order, and that is why Hispanics voted for President Trump,\" Flores said. \"We wanted law and order and continue to want law and order now more than ever.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
      "The motion, which had been expected, argues the case against James was driven by personal \"animus\" that arose out of James' civil fraud lawsuit against President Trump and his companies in her capacity as state attorney general.",
      "\"This lawsuit, and AG James' outspoken criticism of the President, triggered six years of targeted attacks. President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state's attorney general,\" lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.",
      "The name-calling by Mr. Trump includes describing her as \"crooked,\" \"scum,\" \"a monster\" and \"criminal,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing is similar to one from another of Mr. Trump's perceived adversaries, former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Comey has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.",
      "James is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a \"tool of revenge.\"",
      "To bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny \"while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.\"",
      "They say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the alleged conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was accused of identifying three houses as his first home.",
      "\"The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Like Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who was named to the post by Mr. Trump after the resignation of former acting U.S. attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "After Siebert's resignation, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote that the administration \"can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" adding: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "Friday's court filing criticized Halligan's ascension to the job, writing that \"the President removed what he viewed as the final roadblock to his plan\u2014interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014and installed his own lawyer, Ms. Halligan, with the singular mission of churning out indictments against his political enemies. Ms. Halligan promptly obeyed.\"",
      "Comey and James are separately challenging their indictments on the grounds that Halligan was illegally named to her job.",
      "James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general.",
      "James has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump's, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Mr. Trump had committed fraud. Mr. Trump has denied all allegations against him.",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states Friday that it is working to comply with a federal judge's order to provide full food benefits to roughly 42 million Americans through November, an agency official said.",
      "Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in new guidance\u00a0issued to state agencies that the USDA is \"working towards implementing November 2025 full benefit issuances in compliance with\" an order from U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued Thursday.",
      "Penn said in the guidance that \"later today,\" the Trump administration \"will complete the processes necessary to make funds available\" to cover November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in full.",
      "The notification comes as the Justice Department has appealed the judge's order requiring the administration to provide full assistance to Americans who use the allotments to purchase groceries. The Justice Department has also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to block his order and requested a decision on its bid for emergency relief by 4 p.m.",
      "McConnell is overseeing a lawsuit brought by a group of cities and nonprofits after the USDA informed states late last month it would halt food assistance for November to Americans enrolled in the nutrition program because of the ongoing government shutdown. He\u00a0ordered the Trump administration\u00a0last week to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to SNAP recipients for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits.

      "In his latest decision, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot used for Child Nutrition programs \u2014 to do so. McConnell said comments from administration officials indicate that food benefits are being withheld for \"political purposes.\"",

      "Shoppers are likely to pay less this year because the foods that make up a traditional Thanksgiving meal aren't the ones driving grocery inflation, the bank found. Grocery prices overall rose 2.7% in September from a year ago, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, led by increases in\u00a0beef, bananas and coffee\u00a0\u2014 none of which are Thanksgiving staples.",
      "\"At the heart of the uptick in the CPI's food-at-home increase is protein, specifically beef and eggs, which are not on the Thanksgiving menu,\" Wells Fargo's analysts said in the report. \"Without those items, consumers will find relief in a traditional Thanksgiving meal.\"",
      "That may surprise some shoppers, with more than two-thirds saying they're bracing for a pricier Thanksgiving grocery bill, according to new research from financial services company Empower.",
      "Consumers who stick to store brands are expected to spend a total of about $80 on Thanksgiving dinner ingredients for a meal to feed 10 people, while buying brand-name products could push that amount to $95, the analysis found. That's based on serving a meal of turkey, stuffing, frozen vegetables, prepared mashed potatoes, gravy, fresh cranberries, dinner rolls, salad mix, and pumpkin pie with whipped cream.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:44 -0500",
    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

      "\"We can confirm that Mark Sanchez is no longer with the network,\" a Fox Sports spokesman told CBS News on Friday. \"There will be no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Sanchez, 38, has been off the air since police said he was stabbed during a fight with a truck driver outside an Indianapolis hotel on Oct. 4. The former quarterback was in Indianapolis for Fox's coverage of the Oct. 5 game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Sanchez faces a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanors, for what prosecutors have said was a fight over parking. If convicted, he could face a sentence of between one to six years in prison.",
      "Sanchez and Fox Sports also face a civil lawsuit filed by the driver, 69-year-old Perry Tole.",
      "Nick Sanchez Jr., on behalf of the Sanchez family, provided a statement to CBS News on Friday, saying: \"It's been a long month for Mark as he continues to recover from serious injuries while also grieving the loss of a close friend. While the recent news \u2014 and its timing \u2014 is understandably disappointing, our priority remains his continued healing and recovery.\"",
      "He continued: \"Mark deeply values his time at FOX and the exceptional colleagues he's had the privilege to work with. Those relationships are meaningful and will endure.\"",
      "Fox Sports announced Friday that it has hired former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to replace Sanchez as its No. 4 NFL crew. He will also team up with play-by-play announcer Adam Amin and sideline reporter Kristina Pink. Brees' first game will be Nov. 16.",
      "Brees retired from the NFL following the 2020 season after a 20-year career with the San Diego Chargers and New Orleans, including leading the Saints to their only Super Bowl title during the 2009 season.",
      "He joined NBC in 2021 as an analyst for Notre Dame college football games and was in the studio most Sundays for \"Football Night in America.\" Brees called a wild-card game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals but noticeably struggled. NBC and Brees parted ways a couple of months later.",
      "Brees made a studio appearance during \"Fox NFL Sunday\" earlier this season and is slated to be an analyst for one of Netflix's two Christmas Day games.",
      "\"Drew is one of the best to ever play the game, and we couldn't be more excited to have his prolific credentials and unique insights as part of our coverage on Sundays,\" said Brad Zager, Fox Sports president of production & operations and executive producer. \"We're thrilled to welcome him to the Fox Sports family.\"",
      "Brees added in a statement that he appreciated the opportunity to join Fox and that \"I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insights I provide to the fans each Sunday.\"",
      "In his first year of eligibility, Brees is among the list of 52 modern-era players being considered for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Brees remains second all-time in league history in passing yards (80,358) and passing touchdowns (571).",
      "While Brees takes over, Sanchez's legal issues will go on.",
      "An Indianapolis judge scheduled his trial to begin on Dec. 11.",
      "A police affidavit alleges that Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis on Oct. 4. Tole claims in his lawsuit that Sanchez entered the truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray.",
      "When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.",
      "Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.",
      "Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.",

    "summary": "Workers looking to pick up extra cash working retail jobs this winter may be out of luck as stores pull back on hiring.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

      "Former NFL player Antonio Brown will return to Miami from a New Jersey jail after deciding not to contest his extradition to Florida on an attempted murder charge, officials said Friday.",
      "Brown, 37, was brought to the jail in Essex County, New Jersey, after his arrest by U.S. Marshals in Dubai. He waived extradition at a brief court hearing Friday.",

      "Amateur boxing event turns violent outside ring",
      "According to an arrest warrant, Brown is accused of grabbing a handgun from a security staffer after a celebrity boxing match on May 16 and firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier. The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators one of the bullets grazed his neck.",
      "\"Cellphone video obtained from social media showed Mr. Brown with the firearm in his hand advancing toward Mr. Nantambu on the outside walk. The video captures two shots which occur as Mr. Brown is within several feet of Mr. Nantambu,\" the arrest affidavit says. \"The video also captures Mr. Nantambu ducking after the first shot is heard.\"",
      "Brown was not immediately arrested that night because initially police did not identify Nantambu as a victim. It wasn't until May 21 that Nantambu gave a full statement about the incident to police and identified Brown as the shooter, the affidavit says.",
      "Based on his social media posts, Brown had been living in Dubai for several months. It wasn't immediately clear why it took investigators so long to arrest him, or why he was brought to New Jersey rather than Miami. It also wasn't clear from court or jail records if Brown has a lawyer.",
      "In a social media post after the altercation, Brown said he was defending himself because he was \"jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",

      "He was a key part of the Buccaneers team that defeated Kansas City in the 2021 Super Bowl, including a touchdown pass thrown by Tom Brady.",
      "Brown has dealt with several legal problems over the years. He previously had been accused of battery of a moving truck driver, several domestic violence charges, failure to pay child support and other incidents.",

      "\"President Trump has approved a pardon for Darryl Strawberry, three-time World Series champion and eight-time MLB All-Star,\" the White House official said. \"Mr. Strawberry served time and paid back taxes after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion. Following his career, Mr. Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for over a decade \u2014 he has become active in ministry and started a recovery center which still operates today.\"",
      "Strawberry played seven seasons with the Mets, from 1983-90, and helped lead the team to its 1986 World Series championship. He went on to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants before returning to New York for the Yankees. He hit .259 with 335 homers, 1,000 RBIs and 221 stolen bases in 17 seasons.

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "President Trump on Thursday pardoned former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his former chief of staff Cade Cothren, who were convicted on federal corruption charges.",
      "Casada, a Republican, was sentenced in September to three years in prison over a 2020 scheme to receive over $50,000 in taxpayer money from a mailer program for lawmakers. Prosecutors said Cothren, with support from Casada, listed a fake name on tax documents for a political consulting firm that received the funds. Cothren was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.",
      "\"The defendants abused their power as government officials and defrauded taxpayers for their own enrichment,\" Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division,\u00a0said\u00a0after the September sentencing. \"The Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who betray public trust.\"",
      "But the White House said Friday that the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden had \"significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue involving constituent mailers \u2014 which were billed at competitive prices, never received a complaint from legislators, and resulted in a net profit loss of less than $5,000.\"",
      "Casada's attorney Ed Yarbough said he was still waiting for the pardon paperwork, but Mr. Trump had called Casada on Thursday to give him the news that he would be granted a full pardon. The call came days before Casada was supposed to report to prison to serve his sentence.",
      "Casada resigned as speaker in 2019 amid multiple scandals that were not related to the corruption charges, including reports he had exchanged sexually explicit texts about women with Cothren.",

    "summary": "The agreement with the Trump administration will \"immediately restore and continue the university's research funding,\" Cornell University's president said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Cornell University has reached an agreement\u00a0with the Trump administration to restore federal funding, with the university to pay $30 million directly to the federal government to put an end to claims by the Justice Department. Cornell will also invest $30 million in U.S. agriculture research.",
      "Cornell is one of the many universities the Department of Education warned it was investigating for potential Title VI violations related to antisemitic harassment and discrimination amid campus protests over the war in Gaza. It was also one of the schools officials were investigating over how it considers race in the admissions process.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has secured another transformative commitment from an Ivy League institution to end divisive DEl policies,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Friday, calling it \"a huge win in the fight to restore excellence to American higher education and make our schools the greatest in the world.\"",
      "The University of Virginia also recently reached an agreement with the Trump administration that resulted in the administration dropping probes into the university.",
      "Cornell President Michael I. Kotlikoff shared news of the deal Friday in\u00a0a letter\u00a0addressed to the Cornell community. He said \u00a0research funding will be \"immediately restored\" after more than $250 million in federal funding interruptions since April, which he said \"disrupted the research of faculty and students across all campuses.\"",
      "He noted, \"The resolution is explicit that Cornell's agreement to these terms is not an admission of wrongdoing.\"",
      "In return for the payments, to be made over three years, the federal government agreed to close all investigations and reviews into Cornell.",
      "\"Cornell has not been found in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in any of the investigations or compliance reviews of the university's program,\" Kotlikoff's letter said. \"The government has further agreed to restore terminated federal grants, release all withheld funds for active grants, and consider Cornell fully eligible for new grants and funding awards, without disadvantage or preference.\"",
      "Cornell also agreed to provide the government with \"relevant anonymized admissions data for statistical analyses,\" including data on race, grade point averages and performance on standardized tests. It agreed to utilize Justice Department resources for anti-discrimination training and will conduct annual surveys on the campus climate for students.",
      "\"Recipients of federal funding must fully adhere to federal civil rights laws and ensure that harmful DEI policies do not discriminate against students,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Kotlikoff said the agreement \"explicitly recognizes Cornell's right to independently establish our policies and procedures, choose whom to hire and admit, and determine what we teach, without intrusive government monitoring or approvals.\"",

    "summary": "Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, introduced legislation to restore funding to Head Start programs as some have been forced to close because of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin introduced a bill Friday to restore funding for Head Start programs during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "\"My bill would give families certainty that Head Start and the care it provides will continue,\" Baldwin said in a statement provided exclusively to CBS News. \"If my Republican colleagues don't want to sit down and talk about saving 22 million Americans from skyrocketing health care costs, I hope they can at least agree that 750,000 children and their families shouldn't pay the price for Washington dysfunction.\"",
      "The Keep Head Start Funding Act of 2025 would ensure that programs could keep operating even if Congress hasn't passed new appropriations bills. It would retroactively take effect from Sept. 30 \u2014 immediately before government funding lapsed and the shutdown began.",
      "At least 140 Head Start programs, serving 65,000 children, have not received federal funding to renew grants in October or early November, according to the National Head Start Association. As of Nov. 1, the organization says 20 programs have partially or fully closed as a result of the shutdown, affecting nearly 10,000 children.",
      "\"Simply put, there is broad bipartisan, bicameral support for Head Start in Congress, because it works,\" said Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association.",
      "This month, the Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program\u00a0shuttered its Head Start program, impacting more than 300 children. Even if the shutdown ends, Head Start director Tawny Hardyman told CBS News she expects the program could remain closed through the end of the year.",
      "\"My main concern is for the well being of the children and families,\" Hardyman explained. \"Once they come to their resolution, then the federal workers that support the Head Start grants have to be recalled back to work and they have to process our applications.\"",
      "\"What we have told staff is to be prepared, possibly through the rest of this calendar year until December 31st,\" she said.",
      "Other programs have been granted a temporary reprieve. In Tallahassee, Florida, the Capital Area Community Action Agency has relied on donations and a patchwork of support from local schools and churches to keep most of its Head Start programs afloat through mid-November. Once that is exhausted, the program, which has 378 children enrolled, could be forced to close.",
      "\"As far as having the money to run the operation, pay employees, things of that nature, we won't have that,\" said Head Start director Darrel James.",
      "James welcomed news of Baldwin's bill, given the uncertainty of the government funding impasse, now in its 38th day.",
      "\"We are definitely concerned that it could be a lot longer,\" James said. \"That's the scary part.\"",

Bad Bunny also became the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for song, record and album of the year in the same year, according to Variety.",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing a new passport policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to enforce for now its policy ending the use of the \"X\" marker on passports and requiring the documents to reflect the passport-holder's \"biological sex at birth.\"",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing the policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year. The injunction allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared to split 6-3 in the decision, with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "\"Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth \u2014 in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,\" the court said in an unsigned decision. \"And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex 'lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'\"",
      "The court said in its order that the Trump administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and wrote that the district court's decision to provide broad relief blocks enforcement of an executive branch policy \"with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.\"",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the harms to the plaintiffs challenging the new rules outweigh the government's interest in immediately implementing the passport policy.",
      "Without relief, transgender Americans \"are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other,\" Jackson wrote. \"The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice \u2014 before their legal challenges have even been resolved \u2014 is palpable.\"",
      "She was joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the district court in Massachusetts interfered with the president's exercise of his foreign policy powers with its June ruling. It also said it has been the government's policy since 1977 \u2014 with the exception of during the Biden administration \u2014 to not allow passport applicants to self-select their preferred sex designation.",
      "\"Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex \u2014 especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive reversed a policy adopted by the Biden administration that let passport applicants choose their sex marker on the document based on their gender identity and added the \"X\" marker as an option for those who are nonbinary or don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "The president's measure defined \"sex\" as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively stopping applicants from choosing a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the \"X\" marker and changed applications to offer only the \"M\" or \"F\" designations. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought a court order that required the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy and allow them to self-attest as to their sex, including by selecting the \"X\" marker.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued a temporary order in April siding with the plaintiffs, finding in part that the State Department \"failed to offer a reasoned explanation\" for the new passport policy. Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, also ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and discriminates based on sex.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group \u2014 transgender Americans \u2014 who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her decision.",
      "In June, she extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who would seek a new passport that reflected a sex designation aligning with their gender identity or wanted a passport with the \"X\" designation.",
      "Kobick required the Trump administration to allow those passport applicants to self-select a sex marker \u2014 including the \"X\" designation \u2014 that corresponds with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected the administration's request.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He wrote that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking the plan's enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",
      "\"The question is whether the Constitution requires the government to adopt respondents' preferred definition of sex. It does not,\" Sauer wrote, adding that the passport policy defines sex in terms of biology, not self-identification.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, however, said the State Department has for decades allowed changes to passport sex markers to align with the applicant's gender identity.",
      "\"By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives Plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 20:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "summary": "After seven attempts, Ukrainian forces managed to extract a wounded comrade from Russian-occupied ground with a drone resembling an armored off-road casket.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian forces managed to rescue one of their own recently \u2014 a wounded soldier trapped for 33 days behind enemy lines \u2014 by sending a casket-shaped, off-road robot to navigate a perilous route dodging landmines and drone attacks to retrieve him.",
      "After six failed rescue attempts, the 1st Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces managed to rescue the soldier from Russian-occupied territory in the east of the country.",
      "The remotely operated robot, which looks like an armored casket mounted on an ATV frame and wheels, traveled a total of about 40 miles for the mission \u2014 almost 23 of them with a damaged wheel after it struck a landmine. The mission took just under six hours, according to the battalion, which shared a video of the operation on social media this week.",
      "\"We received a request from an adjacent unit to try to evacuate their soldier,\" the medical battalion's head of communications Volodymyr Koval told CBS News on Friday. \"They had already made four attempts on their own, but they were unsuccessful. They turned to us because we had the appropriate capabilities.\"",
      "The most important of those capabilities was the robot, a MAUL ground drone originally developed by the medical battalion precisely for the purpose of extracting wounded or trapped soldiers.",
      "\"The soldier's location was known, there was contact with him, food was being sent to him from the air \u2014 logistics were carried out by aerial drones. We began to develop a plan for his evacuation and study the route,\" Koval told CBS News. \"Two attempts were unsuccessful due to enemy mines and drones waiting on the ground in ambush on the roads. The seventh mission was successful, despite the fact that the drone hit an anti-personnel mine.\"",
      "The robot reached the soldier, who climbed into the personnel capsule, laid down and closed himself inside. But the rolling rescue unit then came under attack by a Russian drone on its way back toward the battle line. The soldier survived thanks to the armored capsule.",
      "Military medics provided first aid and stabilized the soldier as soon as the robot reached Ukrainian-controlled territory.",
      "\"The wounded warrior is now undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. His life has been saved,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video statement Thursday evening. He lauded the troops of the 1st Medical Battalion for the operation, stressing the importance of such lifesaving missions and battlefield innovations.",
      "\"We will scale up exactly this kind of technological backbone for our army \u2014 more ground robotic systems operating at the front, more drones of all types, and increased deliveries of modern solutions that help achieve results in combat, in providing supplies for our combat units, and in evacuating our wounded warriors,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Koval told CBS News it was not the first and would likely not be the last ground-based drone evacuation carried out by the battalion.",
      "\"This is simply a special story of perseverance that carries an important message for the military and society. We are actively trying to implement unmanned evacuation from the battlefield, directly from the line of combat contact. This is the main task of our unit,\" he said. \"Evacuation is now very difficult due to the high density of fire, which is visible in the video. But every Ukrainian soldier must know that they will fight for him, that they will try to save him. This is what we wanted to show by telling this story.\"",
      "The MAUL robot used in the operation was originally designed by the 1st Medical Battalion, but is now made and sold by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid, which bought the license to the design.",
      "According to the battalion, the MAUL robot \"is an evacuation platform powered by an internal combustion engine, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 70 kph (43 mph). It has a special armored capsule to protect the wounded and special metal wheels that do not contain air.\"",
      "The units are now sold by DevDroid for about $19,000 each.",
      "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian National Guard's 13th Khartia Brigade used a Zmiy-500 ground drone, a simpler robot that offers less protection to the person riding it, to evacuate a wounded soldier while simultaneously delivering supplies to the front line, according to a social media post by the brigade.",
      "The drone covered more than 20 miles and completed the operation without incident, the brigade said.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A convicted sex offender who was mistakenly released early from a London prison was re-arrested Friday after more than a week of freedom, police said.",
      "Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was one of two men set free in accidental releases from Wandsworth Prison over the past two weeks that have caused a political headache for the government and focused renewed attention on an overcrowded and overwhelmed prison system.",
      "The other inmate, Billy Smith, 35, who was sentenced to nearly four years for fraud and accidentally released on the same day as Cherif, turned himself in at the Victorian-era lockup on Thursday.",
      "Cherif, 24, a registered sex offender due to a previous indecent exposure conviction, was serving time for trespass with intent to steal. The Algerian national who overstayed a legal visit to the U.K. in 2019 was in the initial stages of deportation when he was allowed to walk off the prison ground on Monday.",
      "He was stopped by police in north London in an arrest filmed by national broadcaster Sky News. He initially denied he was the man they were looking for, but then said he wasn't to blame for being on the streets.",
      "\"I'm not Brahim, bro,\" he initially told a police officer, who said he recognized his distinctive nose. \"Everyone know him, he's in (the) news,\" Cherif said.",
      "After police officers pulled out their phones to look at the photo of the wanted man, he effectively admitted he was Cherif.",
      "\"It is not my fault,\" Cherif said. \"They released me illegally.\"",
      "Both men were wrongly freed from Wandsworth, which was built in southwest London in the middle of the 19th century, and was already under scrutiny after another prisoner escaped two years ago by clinging to the underside of a food delivery truck.",
      "The inadvertent releases followed more stringent security checks that were supposed to be in place after an asylum-seeker who inspired a rise of anti-immigrant protests was mistakenly freed from Chelmsford Prison, east of London, on Oct. 24.",
      "Prison chiefs were summoned to a meeting Thursday to discuss the errors and said efforts were being made to update a system that still uses paper prison records.",
      "The mistaken releases have become a source of heated debate and a political liability for the Labour government after being a thorn in the side of their Conservative predecessors.",
      "According to government figures, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year ending March 2025, a 128% increase on the previous 12-month period.",
      "Conservatives say the Labour government is to blame for a policy to release some inmates earlier to ensure prisons don't exceed capacity.",
      "But Labour has blamed 14 years of Conservative rule and years of austerity that has starved the Prison Service of resources.",
      "\"We inherited a prison system in crisis and I'm appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing,\" Justice Secretary David Lammy said after the arrest. \"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 11:04:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Canadian farm's fight to save its ostriches went all the way to the country's supreme court, and even drew an intervention from RFK Jr., but was lost in the end.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday unanimously dismissed a last-ditch appeal by an ostrich farm in British Columbia to save its flock of hundreds of birds. The government issued a cull order for the farm's stock last year, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it would proceed with killing the ostriches to prevent an avian flu outbreak.",
      "\"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) will be moving forward to complete depopulation and disposal measures as authorized by the Health of Animals Act and guided by the stamping out policy for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),\" the CFIA said in a statement following the court's decision.",
      "The CFIA did not say how the ostriches would be killed, but multiple gunshots were heard at the Universal Ostrich Farm on Thursday night, according to Canadian media. The gunfire could be heard on a live video stream on farm spokesperson Katie Pasitney's Facebook page.",
      "Pasitney made an emotional plea to the Supreme Court to rule against the cull just before Thursday's court meeting, saying the birds were healthy and posed no threat.",
      "\"Supreme Court of Canada, they are healthy. They are everything that we have and everything that we loved for 35 years, please stop,\" she said in a video posted on social media.",
      "It has been nearly a year since over 300 ostriches on the farm became embroiled in a legal battle between the CFIA and their owners in Edgewood, British Columbia.",
      "In early December 2024, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hit the farm, resulting in the deaths of nearly 70 birds within a few weeks. The CFIA described the outbreak as \"unprecedented\" and warned that it could have a significant impact on Canada's poultry industry, ordering a cull of the affected birds.",
      "\"You want to know what pain looks like?\" Pasitney asked in an emotional video posted online right after the court's decision on Thursday, showing her mother, the farm's owner, crying. \"She is going to lose everything she has ever loved for 35 years \u2026 that's what pain looks like when the government fails you.\"",
      "The CFIA said it takes its responsibility to protect the health of both animals and Canadians extremely seriously, and that it takes all disease control measures deemed necessary to protect health and trade.",
      "\"Given that the flock has had multiple laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 and the ongoing serious risks for animal and human health and trade, the CFIA continues planning for humane depopulation with veterinary oversight at the infected premises,\" the agency said.",
      "The case drew attention from the U.S. government, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with the director of the National Institutes of Health and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, sending a letter to the head of the CFIA in May asking him to reconsider the cull, arguing that the ostriches could be valuable to study.",
      "\"We are respectfully requesting CFIA to consider not culling the entire flock of ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm,\" Kennedy's letter said, \"given that a proportion of these ostriches were infected with avian influenza (H5N1) last year, we believe there is significant value in studying this population, for several reasons.\"",
      "In a follow-up letter in July, Kenndey urged the CFIA to delay the cull and proposed immediate collaboration between the CFIA, Canadian researchers and the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, offered the farm's owners the option of relocating the birds to his ranch in Florida, but the offer was turned down, according to Canada's national public broadcaster CBC.",
      "The CFIA said it would compensate the farm owners for the value of the animals, paying up to $2,200 per bird once supporting documentation was completed.",

      "He found \"five gold bars and many coins\" buried in plastic bags, local newspaper Le Progres reported.",
      "Police found the gold had been acquired legally and had been melted down some \"15 or 20 years ago\" at a nearby refinery, it said.",
      "Because the gold bars had unique numbers that could be traced, police were able to determine that they had not been stolen, the outlet reported.",

In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you cooperate with the Committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the Committee,\" the American lawmakers said.",
      "Neither Garcia nor the committee has the power to subpoena Andrew, who was formally stripped of the title of prince on Thursday.",
      "No Republicans on the House committee signed the letter.",
      "The communication cited Andrew's widely reported friendship with Epstein, which continued after the American financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution. It also mentioned Andrew's visits to Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Epstein's trip to the late Queen Elizabeth II's residence at Balmoral in Scotland.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:33:14 -0500",
    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

      "U.S. bombers have also conducted shows of force near Venezuela, flying over the Caribbean Sea off the country's coast on at least four occasions since mid-October.",
      "Maduro \u2014 who has been indicted on drug charges in the United States \u2014 insists there is no drug cultivation in his country, which he says is used as a trafficking route for Colombian cocaine against its will.",
      "The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in \"armed conflict\" with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.",

      "\"Nothing in the legal opinion even mentions Venezuela,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Warner added that intelligence assets on alleged drug trafficking operations in the region are \"quite good,\" but argued that the U.S. should be intercepting the boats and bringing the alleged traffickers to justice.",
      "\"I'm not too worried that they're going to take out a fishing boat, because our intelligence community is very, very good. But I'm not confident that we know precisely who are in those boats and why they're there,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, disagreed with the characterization, telling reporters that \"we know the contents of the boats\" and \"we know the personnel, almost to a person.\"",
      "Kaine said Thursday the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is based on a misreading of constitutional text. Schiff added that the opinion \"is broad enough to authorize just about anything.\"",
      "\"If that opinion were to be adopted, it would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Schiff also questioned the U.S. military buildup in the region, calling it \"an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change.\" In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week, Mr. Trump said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's days are numbered. After Wednesday's briefing, Himes, a Democrat, said \"there is no apparent plans to expand this beyond what they say that they are doing.\"",
      "Kaine said some of his Republican colleagues are uncomfortable with the potential for escalation, but have not told him they plan to support his resolution. Schiff added that some of them \"may have been more comfortable with the idea when they thought it was a very short campaign, but now that it is an ongoing thing with no definite endpoint, I think the concern has increased.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution would require the U.S. to remove its armed forces from \"hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" It said U.S. actions in the region \"indicate imminent involvement\" in hostilities within or against the South American nation.",
      "In October, Senate Republicans blocked a similar effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. Kaine said he and Schiff planned to keep renewing their efforts to force votes on the war powers issue.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired Monday.",
      "When asked how the administration plans to proceed, a senior administration official told CBS News that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\" The strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,\" according to the official. The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "In a floor speech on Oct. 8, Paul said the strikes risk killing innocent people and decried the lack of due process.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "On Thursday, Paul asked why the two survivors were repatriated if they were such a threat to the U.S.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown and \n                                                  \n                                  Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Muslim majority countries, in a symbolic move aimed at boosting an initiative that was a hallmark of President Trump's first term.",
      "The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations \u2014 Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Those four countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social that he'd hosted a \"great call\" between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He wrote that Kazakhstan is the \"first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.\"",
      "Trump called Kazakhstan's joining \"a major step forward in building bridges across the World\" and said \"more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.\"",
      "A signing ceremony would soon make it official, Mr. Trump said, and \"there are many more Countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH.\"",
      "Later Thursday, Mr. Trump hosted a summit with the leaders of Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian nations, during which the president said more countries could join the Abraham Accords.",
      "Asked by reporters what Kazakhstan's entry into the accords will mean, given that Kazakhstan and Israel already had long-standing ties, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it an \"enhanced relationship, beyond just diplomatic relations and having embassies in each other's capitals.\"",
      "\"You're now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together,\" Rubio said.",
      "U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Kazakhstan's participation in the Abraham Accords with Israel was important as it would enhance their bilateral trade and cooperation and signaled that Israel is becoming less isolated internationally, notably after massive criticism and protests over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious group while excavating an area in northern Israel, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country, according to the\u00a0Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "The wine press, which is likewise the earliest relic of wine production in Israel, was found during an excavation at the archaeological site Tel Megiddo, said the agency, which noted that the work was conducted ahead of the planned construction of a highway through the same area.",
      "Officials said the wine press, which was carved from stone, was evidence that a Canaanite religious group existed at the site thousands of the years ago. The Canaanites were ancient indigenous people who inhabited the area known as Canaan, which was located in \"the Levant\" along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, from Greece to western Europe, according to EBSCO. They were a group of mixed ethnicities although the Hebrew Bible distinguishes them from Israelites and teaches that Israelites arrived later than they did.",
      "Dr. Amir Golani and Barak Tzin, excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the wine press discovery was unprecedented.",
      "\"Until now, indirect evidence indicated that wine could have been produced 5,000 years ago, but we did not have conclusive proof of this \u2013 a 'smoking gun' that would clearly show when this happened in our area,\" they said in a statement. \"This wine press finally provides new and clear evidence that early wine production actually took place here.\"",
      "In addition to the wine press, archaeologists found a model of a small temple and one set of ceremonial utensils, which were approximately 3,300 years old. Those were among a wider collection of items found during excavations in the region, which covered about three-fourths of a mile and \"uncovered many finds from different periods,\" the authority said. Their discoveries spanned the early Bronze Age, which ran from about 3300 to 3000 B.C.E., and the late Bronze Age, which ran from about 1550 to 1400 B.C.E.",
      "There was more evidence of early Canaanite populations in the area, the authority said. They included residential buildings uncovered around the wine press, ritual vessels and pottery imported from Cyprus, which are thought to illuminate some of the ancient peoples' ritual ceremonies and cultures.",
      "The new discoveries were put on display Thursday at the annual conference on innovations and research in Israeli excavations, which was organized by the Israel Antiquities Authority an the School of Archaeology and Maritime Civilizations at the University of Haifa.",

      "\"The artifacts were handed over by the American authorities to the Egyptian Embassy in the U.S., and they arrived in Egypt about two weeks ago,\" Nevine El-Aref, the ministry's media adviser, told CBS News.",
      "Three main sets of artifacts were recovered, the first consisting of 11 items handed over by the New York State Attorney General's office. Among them is a mummy burial mask that belonged to a young man from the Roman era, a vessel in the shape of the god Bes, and a limestone funerary stelae, an inscribed tablet, also from the Roman period.",
      "In May, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said it had returned 11 antiquities to the people of Egypt that were recovered thanks to multiple criminal investigations.",
      "\"Eleven more priceless antiquities have now been recovered and returned to where they rightfully belong,\" District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said in a statement at the time. \"None of this work is possible without the dedication and commitment of our team, and I thank them for their work on these investigations.\"",
      "The second group was handed over by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Egyptian Consulate in New York. It includes 24 rare manuscripts bearing writings in the ancient Coptic and Syriac languages.",
      "The third group consisted of a colored plaster panel from the 18th Dynasty, about 3,000 years ago, that was confiscated by the New York State Attorney General's office after it was determined to have been illegally removed from Egypt.",
      "\"Any artifact that belongs to Egypt's heritage is important. Even if it's a small stone, it is important to bring it back to Egypt, where it belongs,\" El-Aref told CBS News. \"It is very important for Egypt to preserve its archaeological heritage and its history and pass it on to the next generations.\"",
      "An archaeological committee received the pieces, which will be displayed at the Egyptian Museum in central Cairo after they're restored, the ministry said.",
      "Egyptian officials are constantly monitoring the internet to detect illegally smuggled artifacts, and whenever something surfaces online, they collaborate with authorities around the globe to bring them home, El-Aref said.",

      "The hour-long meeting, described by the Holy See as \"cordial,\" focused on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and renewed calls for a two-state solution, a position the Vatican has consistently promoted as the only viable path to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "The talks came nearly a month after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took hold in Gaza, bringing a fragile calm following two years of conflict that began with Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "According to a Vatican statement, both leaders agreed on \"the urgent need to provide assistance to the civilian population in Gaza,\" and to \"end the conflict by pursuing a two-state solution,\" which would see an independent Palestinian state created alongside Israel.",
      "Abbas' visit also marked the 10th anniversary of the \"Comprehensive Agreement\" signed in 2015 between the Holy See and the State of Palestine \u2014 which saw the Vatican, like a rising number of countries, formally recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers some of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but holds no sway in Gaza, arrived in Rome on Wednesday and visited the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he laid flowers at the tomb of the late Pope Francis, whom he called \"a great friend of Palestine.\"",
      "For Abbas, the meeting offered an opportunity to reaffirm international backing for a Palestinian state at a time when the idea seems increasingly remote on the ground.",
      "Abbas has said the PA, which he heads, is ready to step into post-war Gaza to administer the densely populated territory, but Netanyahu's government has rejected any future role for the PA or Hamas in the strip. Netanyahu has also clearly ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state while he is prime minister, and his coalition government includes hard-line factions that espouse building Israeli settlements in the strip instead.",
      "The American pope has echoed his predecessor's support for Palestinian rights while striking a less critical tone on Israel.",
      "He has condemned the forced displacement of civilians in Gaza and called for sustained humanitarian aid, but stopped short of labeling Israel's military operation against Hamas in the territory as \"genocide,\" as Pope Francis did late in his pontificate.",
      "The Vatican's continued advocacy for a two-state solution underscores a broader reality: While the concept remains a cornerstone of international diplomacy \u2014 championed by most governments worldwide and the United Nations, though not clearly by the Trump administration \u2014 it carries less traction in the region itself.",
      "Recent polling shows that most Israelis and Palestinians no longer believe such an arrangement is feasible.",

It was not clear which type had stung the two. Last December, agriculture officials confirmed the Asian giant hornet\u00a0had been eradicated in the U.S. The invasive species\u00a0was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and\u00a0verified two reports\u00a0of the hornet, and efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:03:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Typhoon Kalmaegi battered the Philippines, killing scores of people before moving on to Vietnam, and there's another potential monster storm brewing at sea.",
    "story": [
      "Nha Trang, Vietnam \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi barreled into Vietnam on Thursday after killing more than 140 people in the Philippines, making landfall north of Gia Lai province in central Vietnam and lashing the region with fierce winds and torrential rain.",
      "The storm hit as the central provinces were already reeling from days of flooding caused by record-breaking rainfall that already claimed 47 lives. Forecasters warned that Kalmaegi could dump more than 24 inches of additional rain in some areas, raising fears of deadly landslides and flash floods.",
      "Power outages were reported in several provinces, while trees were uprooted and roofs torn off homes. Authorities also warned of flooding risks in major cities, including Danang and Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "Kalmaegi killed at least 142 people and left another 127 missing after unleashing devastating flooding across the central Philippines before heading to Vietnam, official figures showed Thursday.",
      "The typhoon is so far the world's deadliest of 2025, according to disaster database EM-DAT. Trami, which also hit the Philippines, was last year's third-deadliest typhoon with 191 fatalities.",
      "Floodwaters described as unprecedented rushed through Cebu province's towns and cities this week, sweeping away cars, riverside shanties and even massive shipping containers.",
      "The national civil defense office on Thursday confirmed 114 deaths, though that tally did not include an additional 28 recorded by Cebu provincial authorities. More than 500,000 Filipinos remain displaced.",
      "In Liloan, a town near Cebu City where 35 bodies have been recovered, AFP reporters saw cars piled atop each other by floodwaters and roofs torn off buildings as residents attempted to dig out of the mud.",
      "Christine Aton's sister Michelle, who has a disability, was among Liloan's victims, trapped in her bedroom as the floodwaters rose inside their house.",
      "\"We tried to pry open (her bedroom door) with a kitchen knife and a crowbar but it wouldn't budge. ... Then the refrigerator started to float,\" Aton, 29, said.",
      "\"I opened a window and my father and I swam out. We were crying because we wanted to save my older sister. But my father told me we couldn't do anything for her, that all three of us might end up dead.\"",
      "Chyros Roa, a 42-year-old father of two, said his family was saved by his dog's barking when water rushed into their home in the early hours, giving them just enough time to reach their roof.",
      "\"The current was really strong. We tried to call for rescue, but no one came. We were told the rescuers were swept away by the current,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, President Ferdinand Marcos declared a \"state of national calamity,\" a move allowing the government to release funding for aid and impose price ceilings on basic necessities.",
      "\"Unfortunately, there's another (typhoon) coming with the potential to become an even stronger one,\" Marcos said at an afternoon press briefing.",
      "Still more than 930 miles to the country's east, tropical storm Fung-wong is slowly building strength as it heads toward the Philippines' main island of Luzon. It could reach super typhoon status before it makes landfall on Monday.",
      "State weather service meteorologist Benison Estareja told AFP the rains along Kalmaegi's path were 1.5 times the amount that would typically fall in Cebu for a full November, saying it was something that happened \"once every 20 years.\"",
      "The \"highly urbanized\" nature of the most-affected communities around Cebu City had made it even deadlier, he added.",
      "\"Around four or five in the morning, the water was so strong that you couldn't even step outside,\" said Reynaldo Vergara, 53, adding that everything in his small shop in Mandaue had been lost when a nearby river overflowed. \"Nothing like this has ever happened. The water was raging.\"",
      "In a radio interview, provincial governor Pamela Baricuatro called the situation \"unprecedented.\"",
      "Scientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful due to human-driven climate change. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.",
      "Vietnam, which gets about a dozen typhoons and storms a year, has been  pummeled by a relentless series this year, leaving little time to  recover between disasters.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha urged local authorities to treat Kalmaegi as \"urgent and dangerous,\" calling it \"a very abnormal\" storm in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Authorities ordered thousands to evacuate from coastal communities, and in Quy Nhon city, an AFP reporter saw officials knocking on doors Thursday and warning people to flee before the landfall.",
      "Kalmaegi is the 13th typhoon or tropical storm of 2025 to affect Vietnam. The Philippines has already reached its average of 20 such storms with Kalmaegi, state weather specialist Charmagne Varilla told AFP, adding at least \"three to five more\" storms could be expected by December's end.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-nuclear-weapons-tests-proposals-trump-comments/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 10:21:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday with CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio, Japanese security analyst Narushige Michishita said if the U.S. does resume nuclear explosives testing, it would be \"good news and bad news.\"",
      "\"Good news is that the U.S. is serious in bolstering its nuclear deterrence,\" said Michishita, the executive vice president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and Non-Resident Fellowship at the Atlantic Council. He explained that Japan, as a non-nuclear armed nation, relies heavily on the deterrent protection offered by its American allies, amid heightened tension with its neighbor China.",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he said the government and people of Japan \u2014 the only country on earth to ever have had\u00a0nuclear weapons used\u00a0against it in warfare \u2014 \"have been working very hard to create a world without nuclear weapons.\"",
      "If he could sit down for a candid conversation with President Trump, Michishita said he \"would like to tell him to think in an objective and very sober and low-key manner, without exaggerating or without agitation, agitating the crisis, think about how to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence and take necessary steps, while sending the message to the world that we must not fight nuclear war again.\"",

    "story": [
      "A New Zealand wildlife park that said it was being forced to euthanize seven elderly lions because of financial difficulties has put down two of the big cats.",
      "The Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary said on Tuesday that it had no choice but to euthanize the animals. Rehoming the big cats was not a \"viable or humane option\" because of their \"age, number and complex needs,\" the sanctuary said in an updated statement on Thursday. The lions are between the ages of 18 and 21, which is longer than they would have lived in the wild.",
      "The park said two lions, named Imvula and Sibili, were put down on Wednesday. Both animals had \"serious health conditions that were not treatable and were deteriorating,\" the sanctuary said, and the decision to euthanize them was \"made with deep care and consideration.\"",
      "The sanctuary said the five surviving lions' wellbeing continues to be their priority and that they are still seeking a solution for the surviving lions. Some have expressed interest in purchasing the park and continuing to care for the lions, the sanctuary said, which provides \"a glimmer of hope.\"",
      "\"While the timeframe is short and the situation remains uncertain, we are doing everything we can to explore this possibility and keep hope alive,\" the park wrote on social media. The sanctuary did not specify how much time the remaining lions might have.",
      "The park said it had received supportive condolences and \"threatening and abusive messages\" since announcing the need to euthanize the lions. The sanctuary asked for \"kindness and respect as we navigate this heartbreaking situation.\"",
      "The park's website features 12 lions and one Bengal tiger. The zoo did not say what was going to happen to the five lions who are not set to be euthanized. Taking care of big cats \"comes at an enormous cost,\" according to the park's website. The sanctuary has previously solicited donations of unwanted cows or horses to feed the animals, which eat about three cows' worth of meat each week.",

    "story": [
      "A search continued on Thursday for one of two convicted criminals who were mistakenly released from prison the previous day in Britain \u2014 the second and third such incidents in two weeks and part of a growing trend of mistaken releases that have put the government under fire.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said it was informed by England's prison service on Tuesday afternoon that a 24-year-old was \"released in error\" from Wandsworth prison, in southwest London, on Oct. 29.",
      "The suspect has been identified as Algerian national Brahim Kaddour Cherif, who remained at large on Thursday. Police said he is a registered sex offender who was convicted of indecent exposure last year, sentenced to an 18-month community order and put on the sex offenders' register for five years.",
      "The BBC reported that Cherif last appeared in court in September, charged with failing to comply with requirements for convicted sex offenders.",
      "\"Cherif has had a six-day head start but we are working urgently to close the gap and establish his whereabouts,\" Paul Trevers, who is overseeing the police investigation, said in a statement.",
      "The second man mistakenly released, 35-year-old William Smith, was let go from the same prison as Cherif on Monday, the Surrey Police said, but the force issued an update on Thursday to say he had turned himself back in at Wandsworth Prison in South London.",
      "He was released the same day he appeared at a hearing where he received a 45-month sentence for multiple fraud offenses.",
      "In a statement shared Thursday on social media, the Surrey Police thanked members of the public for sharing its appeal for information on Smith, and said it was canceling its request for help to find him.",
      "\"I am absolutely outraged and appalled by the mistaken release of a foreign criminal wanted by the police. The Metropolitan police is leading an urgent manhunt, and my officials have been working through the night to take him back to prison,\" David Lammy, U.K. deputy prime minister and justice secretary, said in a statement after reports emerged of the first mistaken release, according to the BBC.",
      "\"Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers. That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases which has persisted for too long,\" Lammy said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called that release \"utterly unacceptable\" and said the issue of accidental prisoner releases \"needs to be dealt with, and the system needs to be reformed and the appropriate checks need to be in place to stop this type of thing from ever happening,\" according to The Guardian.",
      "Just last week, the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian man jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, triggered a two-day manhunt and his eventual deportation. British authorities agreed to give him the equivalent of about $600 to get on a plane, rather than filing a new legal challenge to his deportation.",
      "The number of prisoners released from U.K. prisons by mistake has more than doubled in the last year, according to government data analyzed by Britain's Telegraph newspaper.",
      "About 262 prisoners were mistakenly released from March 2024 to March 2025, compared to 115 during the same period the previous year, the Telegraph reported.",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "summary": "The governor of a northern region of Japan says authorities were getting \"desperate\" due to a lack of manpower amid daily reports of bear attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo - Japan's Defense Ministry sent troops on Wednesday to the northern prefecture of Akita to help contain a surge of bear attacks that have horrified residents in the mountainous region.",
      "Bears have shown up near schools, train stations, supermarkets and even a hot springs resort, with attacks by the animals reported almost daily across Japan, mostly in the north.",
      "Since April, more than 100 people have been injured and at least 12 killed in bear attacks across Japan, according to Environment Ministry statistics at the end of October. That is the highest number of people killed by the animals in the country in one fiscal year since 2006, when the ministry started compiling the statistics.",
      "\"Every day, bears intrude into residential areas in the region and their impact is expanding,\" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fumitoshi Sato told reporters. \"Responses to the bear problem are an urgent matter.\"",
      "The Defense Ministry and Akita prefecture signed an agreement on the troop dispatch on Wednesday afternoon, allowing soldiers to set box traps with food inside, transport local hunters and help with the disposal of dead bears. The soldiers will not use firearms to cull bears, officials said.",
      "Akita Gov. Kenta Suzuki said local authorities were getting \"desperate\" due to a lack of manpower amid daily reports of bear attacks.",
      "Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Tuesday the bear mission aims to help secure people's daily lives, but that Self Defense Force service members' primary mission is national defense and they cannot provide unlimited support for the bear response. The Japanese SDF is already understaffed.",
      "So far, the ministry has not received other requests for troop assistance over the bear issue, he said.",
      "In Akita prefecture, which has a population of about 880,000, bears have attacked more than 50 people since May, killing at least four, according to the local government. Experts say 70\uff05 of the bear attacks have occurred in residential areas.",
      "An elderly woman who went mushroom-hunting in the forest was found dead in an apparent bear attack over the weekend in Yuzawa City in the prefecture. Another elderly woman in Akita city encountered a bear while working on a farm and was killed in late October. And a newspaper delivery man was attacked by a bear and suffered an injury in Akita city on Tuesday.",
      "Experts say Japan's aging and declining population in rural areas are among the reasons for the growing bear problem in recent years.",
      "Abandoned neighborhoods and farmland with persimmon or chestnut trees often attract bears to residential areas. Once bears find food and acquire a taste, they keep coming back, experts say.",
      "Local hunters are also aging and not used to bear hunting. Experts say police and other authorities should be trained as \"government hunters\" to help cull the animals.",
      "The government set up a taskforce last week to create an official bear response by mid-November. Officials are considering bear population surveys, the use of communication devices to issue bear warnings and revisions to hunting rules. They also say experts should be trained in hunting and ecology.",
      "The lack of preventive measures in the depopulated and aging northern regions have also led to an increase in the populations of brown bears and Asiatic black bears, the ministry said.",

    "summary": "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum says the harassment she suffered from a drunk man near the government seat is an assault on all women.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that the harassment she suffered from a drunk man in the street near Mexico's seat of government was an assault on all women, and that's why she decided to press charges against him.",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man was arrested.",
      "In a video circulating widely on social platforms, the man appeared to lean in for a kiss and touch the president's body with his hands on Tuesday. She gently pushed his hands away, maintaining a stiff smile as she turned to face him. She could be heard saying, in part, \"Don't worry.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Sheinbaum was firm in emphasizing that this was not the first time she had suffered such harassment and that the problem went far beyond her.",
      "\"No man has the right to violate that space,\" she said\u00a0in a video the Mexican government shared on social media when it announced charges had been filed.",
      "\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" Sheinbaum continued, adding that she also experienced it earlier in her life, as a student.",
      "\"My reflection is that if I do not report the crime, what condition does that leave Mexican women in?\" she said.",
      "The incident also raised questions about the president's security. Sheinbaum explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to save time. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride. She said she would not change how she acts.",
      "Speaking out in solidarity with the president, Brugada used some of Sheinbaum's own language about being elected Mexico's first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman \u2014 in this case, Mexico's most powerful \u2014 is an assault on all women. When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn't just her coming to power, it was all women.",
      "\"If they touch the president, they touch all of us,\" Brugada wrote in\u00a0a statement released Wednesday. Her statement went on to note that Sheinbaum's references to the collective \"arrival\" of women to power in Mexico is \"not a slogan, it's a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.\"",
      "Mexico's National Governors Conference also voiced its support for the president as news broke that she would bring charges against the man.",
      "\"From CONAGO we condemn any aggression against women, in this case the aggression toward the president of Mexico,\" the group said in a statement shared on social media. \"Every form of violence against a woman is unacceptable and should have no place in a society that aspires to live with respect and equality.\"",

    "summary": "Mayor-elect Mamdani's win in New York is cheered by his London counterpart and a former mentor in Uganda, but draws a warning from Israel's U.S. ambassador.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani's win in New York City's mayoral race has ignited passions for and against him, from pride in his birthplace of Uganda and applause from his counterpart in London to anger from Israel's top diplomat in the U.S.",
      "Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who will be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his victory left some people in Africa beaming with pride for a hometown son. Mamdani was born in the East African nation of Uganda 34 years ago, then lived in South Africa for two years before moving with his family to New York as a child.",
      "\"What a moment! It was beautiful! I am excited!\" cheered Joseph Beyanga, CEO of Uganda's National Association of Broadcasters, pumping his hands in the air as he spoke with CBS News.",
      "Beyanga said he was Mamdani's mentor when the now-mayor-elect interned at one of Uganda's top newspapers, the Daily Monitor, during a vacation when he was in high school.",
      "\"Whatever he wanted to do, there was no middle point. Always he wanted the top,\" recalled Beyanga. \"Then I realized he was not just interested in current affairs. He was interested in how the current affairs affect the people. If you're talking about big money, the budget and all that, how does this affect the last person \u2026 he was interested in how it affects the people.\"",
      "\"When it was time to interact with people, he talked to people looking straight in the eye,\" he said.",
      "Beyanga added that even 17 years after he met Mamdani, he still sees the same person in the New York City politician.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. His heart is with the people, and I don't think that will change,\" he said. \"I've seen other outlets calling him populist and opponents giving him all sorts of names. I see a man after the heart of serving people, serving the down-trodden people in society. And hey, that doesn't come far away from who he is. He is a Ugandan boy, and the Ugandan boy cares for the people.\"",
      "Beyanga compared excitement in Uganda now to the exuberance among many Kenyans and Indonesians when former President Barack Obama was first elected.",
      "\"The Ugandans are having their Mamdani moment,\" Beyanga told CBS News, \"and yes, we say if he did it, yes we can!\"",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 who became the British capital's first Muslim leader when he was first elected in 2016 \u2014 voiced solidarity with his new counterpart. Khan is currently serving his third consecutive term.",
      "\"New Yorkers faced a clear choice \u2014 between hope and fear \u2014 and just like we've seen in London \u2014 hope won,\" Khan said in a social media post. \"Huge congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on his historic campaign.\"",
      "Following Mamdani's election win, Time magazine published an article by Khan, who called it \"extraordinary\" that two of the world's most influential cities will be led by people of the same faith.",
      "\"But \u2014 in two of the most diverse cities on Earth \u2014 it's a bit beside the point,\" Khan said. \"We did not win because of our faith. We won because we addressed voters' concerns, rather than playing on them.\"",
      "\"Mayor Mamdani and I might not agree on everything. Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. Put policy differences aside, though, and it's clear that we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.\"",
      "Mamdani, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has been accused of antisemitism and being pro-Hamas, which he denies.",
      "He has also been called out for refusing to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Intifada is an Arabic word that means uprising, but which is widely viewed as a slogan inciting violence against Israel. However, during his campaign he said he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase and that it \"is not language that I use.\"",
      "\"Mamdani's inflammatory remarks will not deter us,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Dannon said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"The Jewish community in New York and across the United States deserves safety and respect. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Jewish community leaders to ensure their security and well-being.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Israel said domestic media reports and editorials covering Mamdani's win were largely split along ideological lines. Left-wing commentary generally called for Mamdani to be given a chance, while more right-wing outlets leaned the other way.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Times of Israel's front-page headline read: \"Far-left, anti-Israel candidate Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race.\"",
      "The Jerusalem Post's top featured editorial said: \"Mamdani winning in NY means antisemitism can win elections, would impact Jews globally.\"",

      "Recent studies have shown that even if you feel healthy and fit, your immune system could be aging quicker than you think, which could increase the risk of infections and immune-related disorders.",
      "\"Immune aging, like all aging, means that our immune systems start to slow down, make more mistakes and be less effective at protecting us from infection as we get older,\" Chris Rhodes, Ph.D., a nutritional biochemist and longevity expert in California, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Core nutrients like vitamin D, magnesium, zinc and omega-3s remain foundational,\" she said. \"Beyond that, NAD\u207a boosters, senolytic compounds and select peptides \u2014 such as thymosin alpha-1 for immune modulation and BPC-157 for tissue repair \u2014 are promising adjuncts for supporting repair and lowering chronic inflammation.\"",
      "\"Most people begin to experience measurable immune decline by their late 30s to early 40s, but lifestyle and metabolic health can delay it significantly.\"",
      "The doctor noted, however, that these supplements should complement, not replace, healthy lifestyle behaviors.",

    "summary": "Democratic Party senators were split on why they think Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called for a 10% reduction in air traffic ahead of Thanksgiving.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Sens. Chris Coons and Tim Kaine had opposing viewpoints when asked about the motivations behind Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's decision to reduce flights and air traffic ahead of Thanksgiving.",
      "Democratic senators on Capitol Hill offered differing responses as to why they believe Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made the call to reduce flights and air traffic ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel surge.",
      "After news broke that Duffy was ordering a 10% reduction in flight capacity at 40 airports across the country, Republicans remained largely unified in their messaging that any chaos caused by the forced reductions fell at the feet of Democrats.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said short of \"planes falling out of the sky,\" Democrats will not vote to reopen the government. \"Democrats are flirting with disaster,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote on X in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, adding that there was no choice but to reduce air traffic to keep it safe.",

      "\"I don't question Secretary Duffy,\" Kaine added. \"He wants to make sure that flights are safe.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., had a much more sinister view about Duffy's motivations for compelling a reduction in air traffic ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday. According to Coons, the new directive is an attempt by the Trump administration to \"pressure\" Democrats to reopen the government without their demands on Obamacare being met.",
      "Coons argued that air traffic controllers and other airport personnel have been facing strains since before the shutdown due to cuts from the president's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk.",
      "\"I think it's appropriate for us to focus on improving air safety. It is more urgent for us to focus on the health care cliff that is impacting millions of Americans,\" Coons told reporters Thursday following Duffy's announcement. \"My impression is this is another attempt at putting pressure on Congress to reopen the government,\" Coons added.",
      "FLIGHT CHAOS GRIPS US AIRPORTS AS SOME AIRLINES ADVISE BOOKING \u2018BACKUP TICKET\u2019: SEE THE LIST",
      "Coons was not the only congressional Democrat to chastise the Trump administration for the decision. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., called the move to order a reduction in flights \"unprecedented\" and insisted the move demanded \"more transparency.\"",
      "\"The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data\u00a0that this decision is predicated on with Congress,\" Larsen said after news of the reduction. \"If we want to resolve issues in the National Airspace System, let us fix health care, open government and pay air traffic controllers.\"",

      "In response to the directive to reduce air traffic ahead of the holiday, U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman reaffirmed his group's call for lawmakers to reopen the government or face potential \"chaos\" during the Thanksgiving surge.",
      "\"Today\u2019s announcement from Secretary Duffy and Administrator Bedford reinforces that safety is the number one priority in our nation\u2019s air travel system. The decision to reduce scheduled flight capacity, while necessary to keep our skies safe, will inevitably affect the travel experience, leading to fewer flights, longer delays and more disruptions for travelers,\" Freeman said. All government shutdowns are irresponsible and this decision underscores the urgent need to reopen the government. The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system, forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience. The fault for this situation rests squarely at the feet of Congress.\"",

      "The letter, undersigned by hundreds of tourism and travel industry groups, also warned those planning to fly this Thanksgiving holiday that they could face higher costs and increased wait times, delays and cancellations that could derail family travel plans across the country, if the government shutdown doesn't end before Thanksgiving arrives.",
      "\"Last year, during Thanksgiving week, over 20 million passengers took flights in the United States. Thanksgiving is not only a time of national tradition and family connection, but also one of the most economically important travel weeks of the year,\" the letter states. \"The cost of continued inaction will be felt by families, workers, businesses, and communities in every part of the country.\""

      "Speaking to a group of defense industry executives, Hegseth opened by invoking the specter of a familiar enemy \u2014 but quickly turned his critique inward.",
      "\"Today, I'd like to talk to you about an adversary that poses a threat, a very serious threat, to the United States of America,\" Hegseth said. \"This adversary is one of the world's last bastions of central planning. It governs by dictating in five-year plans from a single capital, it attempts to impose its demands across time zones, continents and continents, oceans and beyond, with brutal consistency, it stifles free thought and crushes new ideas. It disrupts the defense of the United States and places the lives of our men and women in uniform at risk.\"",
      "After teasing comparisons to the former Soviet Union and even the Chinese Communist Party, Hegseth delivered his punchline: \"The adversary I'm talking about is much closer to home. It's the Pentagon bureaucracy \u2014 not the people, but the process.\"",

      "War Secretary Pete Hegseth tore into the Pentagon\u2019s entrenched acquisition bureaucracy in a fiery address this week, comparing the department\u2019s planning culture to Soviet-style central planning that he says has crippled innovation, risk-taking, and the nation\u2019s ability to prepare for war. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)",
      "Hegseth accused decades of War Department policy of being paralyzed by \"impossible risk thresholds\" and \"burdensome and inefficient processes\" that have turned the Pentagon into a self-reinforcing machine where \"process, not outcomes, matter.\"",
      "He argued that previous administrations only made things worse by trying to \"go around the process rather than confront it head-on,\" leaving both the U.S. military and defense industrial base weaker and slower to adapt. \"The institution shapes the individuals as much as the individuals shape the institution,\" Hegseth said. \"Over time, the prevailing pattern becomes more and more entrenched, risk-averse and immovable.\"",
      "Hegseth said this bureaucratic inertia has spilled over into the defense industry itself, creating a system where contractors profit from inefficiency rather than performance. \"The defense industry financially benefits from our backwards culture,\" he said. \"Schedule overruns, huge order backlogs and too-predictable cost increases become the norm.\"",
      "The secretary warned that the result is \"an absence of urgency, a fear of innovation and a fundamental lack of trust\" between the Pentagon and its suppliers \u2014 precisely the kind of dysfunction, he argued, that America\u2019s adversaries exploit.",
      "\"Our military and our taxpayers need a defense industrial base that it can count on to scale with urgency in a crisis \u2014 not one that is content to wait for money before taking action,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s remarks are part of a broader push within the administration to accelerate defense acquisition reform, streamline contracting, and restore what he has called \"wartime urgency\" to the Pentagon\u2019s day-to-day operations.",

      "The speech came as Hegseth signed a trio of internal memoranda directing leadership to take action to achieve the acquisition overhaul.",
      "The first memo, focused on acquisition reform, directs each service branch to identify and eliminate internal barriers that delay weapons fielding. It gives the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps 60 days to submit plans to Hegseth outlining how they will streamline procurement, cut redundant oversight layers, and move from \"process to outcomes.\"",
      "The second memo, addressing the defense industrial base, warns that American production has grown \"risk-averse and immovable,\" mirroring the very bureaucracy it supports. It orders the Under Secretary of War for Acquisition and Sustainment to deliver, within 120 days, a comprehensive plan to expand surge manufacturing capacity, strengthen supply chain resilience, and align industrial output with wartime demand.",
      "The third memo realigns the Pentagon\u2019s arms-transfer and security cooperation enterprise \u2014 consolidating Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales under a single authority to speed weapons deliveries to allies. That directive also includes a 60-day deadline for acquisition and policy leaders to produce an implementation plan that cuts redundant oversight and aligns U.S. export policy with \"America First\" industrial priorities.",
      "\"Our objective is simple: transform the entire acquisition system to operate on a wartime footing,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The Army has become the Pentagon\u2019s test bed for acquisition reform, rolling out some of the most aggressive efforts to speed up weapons procurement and cut through the red tape Hegseth blasted in his remarks. Over the past year, the service has begun dismantling decades-old program structures that officials say are too rigid, too slow and too far removed from the battlefield.",
      "Senior leaders have unveiled what they call a \"transformation strategy\" \u2014 a plan to streamline the Army\u2019s force structure, slash redundant oversight, and reform contracting practices that have kept modern systems from reaching soldiers on time.",
      "\"The Army is running as fast as it possibly can to try to reinvent itself, to be ready for modern warfare,\" Sec. Dan Driscoll told Fox News Digital previously. \"They\u2019ll do a lot of that outside the traditional procurement process.

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Russian state-backed hackers have stepped up their game with new malware families that hide behind fake CAPTCHA tests. The group, known as Star Blizzard or ColdRiver, now uses ClickFix attacks to trick people into launching dangerous malware disguised as a simple \"I'm not a robot\" check.",
      "These attacks represent a new wave of cyber deception, targeting governments, journalists and NGOs with malware that keeps changing faster than researchers can analyze it.",

      "The ClickFix trap: A new kind of social engineering",
      "Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) first observed the hackers using LostKeys malware in espionage operations. Once researchers exposed it, the attackers pivoted quickly, abandoning LostKeys within a week and deploying new tools: NoRobot, YesRobot and MaybeRobot.",
      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "The ClickFix attack works like this: a victim lands on a fake CAPTCHA page that looks identical to the real thing. When they click to prove they're human, the system silently runs NoRobot, infecting the computer and establishing persistence via registry changes and scheduled tasks.",
      "A fake \"I\u2019m not a robot\" CAPTCHA can launch hidden malware in seconds. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the Russian \"robot\" malware chain",
      "The Russian hackers built their latest attack around a chain of connected malware families that unfold step by step once a victim clicks the fake CAPTCHA.",
      "NoRobot acts as the first stage of infection. It prepares the environment by downloading files, modifying registry keys and creating tasks to ensure it stays active even after a reboot.",
      "The hackers briefly tested YesRobot, a Python-based backdoor, but dropped it quickly after realizing the full Python installation drew unwanted attention from defenders.",
      "3,000+ YOUTUBE VIDEOS DELIVER MALWARE DISGUISED AS FREE SOFTWARE",
      "MaybeRobot replaced YesRobot as a stealthier PowerShell-based tool. It can download and execute payloads, run command prompts, and send stolen data back to the attackers. Researchers say MaybeRobot's development has now stabilized, allowing the hackers to focus on refining NoRobot's stealth.",
      "How these attacks keep evolving",
      "Security analysts noticed the malware's delivery chain has shifted several times. At one point, it became\u00a0\"drastically simplified,\" only to grow complex again as the attackers began splitting cryptographic keys across multiple files. This strategy makes it harder for researchers to reconstruct how infections work. Without every piece of the puzzle, the final malware payload cannot be decrypted correctly.",
      "Who's being targeted by the Russian malware",
      "ColdRiver's operations have been linked to the Russian intelligence service (FSB), with years of activity focused on espionage and data theft. The group has consistently targeted Western governments, think tanks, media organizations and NGOs to steal sensitive information and gain strategic insight.",
      "Despite sanctions, infrastructure takedowns and public exposure, the hackers continue to evolve. Their quick shift from LostKeys to NoRobot and MaybeRobot shows a highly organized and well-funded operation capable of retooling within days.",
      "Researchers warn that Russian hackers now use realistic CAPTCHA traps to spread new \"Robot\" malware strains. (Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "CAPTCHAGEDDON SIGNALS A DANGEROUS SHIFT",
      "Even if you're not a government or corporate target, these evolving attacks serve as a reminder that anyone connected to the internet is at some level of risk. Compromised personal accounts, reused passwords or infected email attachments can make everyday users an easy entry point for larger campaigns.",
      "While these threats may aim high, their reach extends everywhere. Awareness and cautious online behavior are essential for everyone.",
      "How to stay safe from Russian malware hidden in fake CAPTCHAs",
      "These practical steps can help you protect your data and devices from the growing wave of Russian malware using fake CAPTCHA pages to spread.",
      "Fake \"I'm not a robot\" pages are the main lure in this Russian malware campaign. If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",
      "Choose reputable antivirus protection that not only scans for known malware but also monitors suspicious behavior. Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "META ACCOUNT SUSPENSION SCAM HIDES FILEFIX MALWARE",
      "Many cyberattacks begin with publicly available data. Using a data removal or privacy protection service helps eliminate your personal information from data broker sites. By reducing what hackers can find online, you make it harder for them to tailor phishing emails or social engineering traps that lead to malware infection.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The malware used in these attacks exploits known security flaws in unpatched systems. Always apply updates as soon as they're released. Turn on automatic updates for your browser, antivirus and operating system. Outdated software is one of the easiest entry points for Russian hackers and other advanced groups.",
      "Cyber experts say awareness is the best defense as these evolving attacks target both organizations and everyday users. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI FLAW LEAKED GMAIL DATA BEFORE OPENAI PATCH",
      "Even if a hacker steals credentials through malware or phishing,\u00a0MFA adds another layer of protection. Require it for email, VPNs, and cloud services. This simple step can block most unauthorized access attempts.",
      "A ransomware payload could be the next evolution of this malware family. Back up critical data to both an external drive and cloud storage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rise of these Russian malware campaigns is a reminder that cybercriminals are always one step ahead. What looks like a harmless \"I'm not a robot\" test can actually hide a serious threat. Protecting yourself isn't just about having antivirus software; it's about staying alert to small online details that can make a big difference. Keep your devices updated, question unexpected pop-ups, and use trusted tools to guard your personal information. With a little caution and consistency, you can outsmart even the most deceptive attacks.",

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead.

Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data.

      "What impostor bank scams look like",
      "Scammers pretending to be from your bank follow a predictable yet terrifying pattern. They begin with an urgent phone call warning that your account has been compromised. The caller ID displays your bank's real number, which builds instant trust.",

      "One journalist reportedly learned this lesson the hard way when he answered what appeared to be a legitimate call from Chase Bank. After a series of convincing conversations with multiple \"representatives,\" he transferred nearly $30,000 to scammers.

These stories are not rare; they reflect how sophisticated and believable modern scams have become.",
      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",
      "Older adults are particularly vulnerable. The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024.

      "Fraud can strike anyone, anywhere, at any time. Scammers have become smarter, faster and more convincing than ever before. They use fear, urgency and technology to make their lies sound real. But you can fight back with knowledge and caution. Stay alert every time your phone rings or your inbox pings. Slow down before you react. Verify before you trust. The few seconds you take to double-check could be what saves your life savings. Remember, even the most tech-savvy people fall for scams when emotions take over. The real key to protection isn't fear, it's awareness and action. Share what you know with friends, family and coworkers. The more people who understand how these scams work, the harder it becomes for criminals to win.",

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

      "The Better Business Bureau warns of a new \"ghost-tapping\" scam draining money from tap-to-pay cards and mobile wallets. (Clara Margais/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",
      "Real-life cases and warnings",
      "A Missouri resident reportedly lost $100 after being approached by a person carrying a handheld card reader. The BBB Scam Tracker has recorded many similar cases across the nation, with losses sometimes exceeding $1,000.",
      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "The BBB says reports of \"ghost tapping\" are rising, with some victims losing more than $1,000 to contactless theft. (M. Scott Brauer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",
      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",
      "In addition to keeping your apps updated, protect your device from hidden threats with strong antivirus software. It scans for malicious apps and spyware that can hijack your tap-to-pay data or record sensitive information.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "While convenient, storing several cards in one app can increase your exposure if your phone is compromised. Keep only the cards you use most often connected to your mobile wallet. This reduces the impact of potential fraudulent activity.",
      "If you ever suspect ghost tapping or notice a strange charge, contact your bank immediately and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Quick action can help prevent additional losses and assist authorities in identifying scam trends.",

Small steps like checking your transaction history and using protective gear can make a big difference. If you notice unauthorized charges, contact your bank immediately, freeze your card and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Technology offers convenience but can also create new risks.

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Grady Trimble breaks down electric vehicle sales as the deadline for prospective buyers to lock in federal tax credit approaches on 'Special Report.'",
      "Driving an electric vehicle could soon mean charging as you go. A new wireless charging pilot in France is showing how coils built into the road can transfer more than 300 kilowatts of power to moving EVs. This breakthrough could make long trips possible without stopping at a charging station.",

      "RESEARCHERS CREATE REVOLUTIONARY AI FABRIC THAT PREDICTS ROAD DAMAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS",
      "The road that powers your vehicle",
      "The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.",
      "So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus \u2014 all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.",
      "New wireless road tech in France powers EVs while they drive, offering more than 300 kilowatts of charging. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Charging ahead: Why it matters",
      "If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.",
      "For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Electreon's one-mile test track near Paris charges moving EVs through coils built into the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The roadblocks ahead",
      "The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.",
      "Still, with global momentum building, it's only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street\u00a0already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.",
      "For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.",

      "The innovation could transform U.S. roads, cutting downtime for electric trucks and buses. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Most people do not realize their smart TV includes microphones that can capture sound even when voice commands are off. These tiny mics power voice search and assistants, but they also pose privacy risks. If that makes you uneasy, you are not alone. The good news is that it takes only a few minutes to disable your smart TV microphone and protect your conversations.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Step one: Find the built-in mic switch",
      "Before opening menus, check your TV's frame. Many models feature a small hardware switch that turns the microphone off completely.",
      "Look closely along the bottom or sides of your screen. Some switches are labeled \"Built-in MIC.\" On Samsung TVs, it's often near the bottom right edge when facing the screen.",
      "Take back control of your space and enjoy your smart TV safely without your microphone listening.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Slide the switch to \"off.\" Your TV may confirm the change with an on-screen message. This is the most reliable way to stop the mic because it physically cuts power to it.",
      "Step two: Disable the smart TV microphone in settings",
      "If your TV lacks a physical switch, go through its settings menu. While the exact names differ by brand, most follow a similar pattern.",
      "Press\u00a0Home or\u00a0Settings on your remote. Look for main sections such as\u00a0System,\u00a0General or\u00a0Privacy. Inside, you'll find microphone or voice options labeled\u00a0Voice Recognition,\u00a0Voice Assistant or\u00a0Microphone Access.",
      "Slide the built-in mic switch to stop your TV from listening. (Samsung)",
      "Examples:",

      "Use your TV\u2019s settings to disable voice features and protect privacy. (Samsung)",
      "Step three: Balance convenience and privacy",
      "Turning off your TV's microphone does not mean you lose smart features. Many remotes include a push-to-talk button that activates voice control only when pressed.",
      "If you rarely talk to your TV, keeping the microphone off makes sense. If you like using voice commands, enable it temporarily when you need it.",
      "Step four: Check connected devices and apps",
      "Even after you disable your smart TV microphone, voice-enabled apps and linked devices may still be listening.",
      "Check any connected smart assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant or Bixby. These platforms can continue capturing audio through your phone, smart speaker or another device on the same network.",
      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "Keep your privacy and still enjoy voice control, just use it when you need it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Take a moment to review privacy settings in those apps as well. Turning off voice activity tracking across all your devices ensures that nothing in your home listens when you do not want it to.",
      "Why smart TVs have microphones at all",
      "Manufacturers include microphones to make TVs more interactive. You can ask for weather updates, control volume or find movies with your voice. It's convenient, but it comes with trade-offs.",
      "Some companies state in their privacy policies that voice data may be shared with third parties for analysis. That means your living room chatter could leave your home.",
      "When you disable your smart TV microphone, you keep the benefits of a modern TV while limiting unwanted data collection.",
      "What this means for you",
      "By taking a few minutes to change one setting or flip one switch, you gain control over what your TV hears. It's an easy way to improve your digital privacy without losing the entertainment experience you love.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:30:15 -0500",
    "summary": "SessionReaper vulnerability hits Magento and Adobe Commerce stores, compromising 250+ sites in one day. Hackers steal data and hijack shopping sessions.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:36:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Shortly after telling states that the food assistance program would be fully funded, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday at least temporarily allowed the Trump administration to withhold about $4 billion in payments for the SNAP food benefits program that a federal judge had ordered.",
      "The court via an order issued by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson provisionally blocked an order issued by Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell that required the payments to be made by Friday night.",
      "The administration has said that because of the government shutdown, there is only enough money to pay partial benefits this month. It had previously agreed to pay about $5 billion from a SNAP contingency fund but objected to paying another $4 billion from a separate program, arguing McConnell had no authority to force it to.",
      "Earlier on Friday, the Agriculture Department had indicated it would make the full payments, according to a memo obtained by NBC News. Patrick Penn, the deputy undersecretary of the Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, informed states that USDA \u201cwill complete the processes necessary\u201d to fully issue SNAP benefits for the time being.",
      "McConnell on Thursday afternoon ordered the administration to deliver full payments to states by Friday, chastising it for delays that he said have likely caused SNAP recipients to go hungry.",
      "The Trump administration unsuccessfully asked the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately block McConnell\u2019s order while that court considers the case in more detail. The administration then turned to the Supreme Court.",
      "In her order, Jackson said a temporary stay was required so that the appeals court can consider the government's application in full. Jackson is the justice assigned responsibility for appeals from the Boston-based appeals court.",
      "That court had said in an earlier order that it intends to act \"as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Nearly 42 million people rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X Friday that \"The Supreme Court just granted our administrative stay in this case. Our attorneys will not stop fighting, day and night, to defend and advance President Trump\u2019s agenda.\"",
      "The administration agreed earlier this week to use $4.65 billion in contingency funds to cover about 65% of the benefits that eligible households would ordinarily receive. But it argued that it cannot draw from additional funds set aside for child nutrition programs, known as Section 32 funding, to fully fund SNAP because doing so would take away resources from other programs, like school lunches.",
      "\u201cOnce those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds \u2014 to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid,\u201d Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Supreme Court filing.",
      "The back-and-forth over SNAP funding has persisted for weeks. First, the administration said the funding would not be distributed in November as long as the federal government remained closed. However, the progressive legal advocacy group Democracy Forward challenged that plan in a lawsuit, prompting McConnell last week to order the Trump administration to distribute benefits as soon as possible.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said earlier this week that the partial payments were disbursed to states. Since states oversee the process of loading payments onto electronic benefits cards, the Trump administration has argued that it has done its part by authorizing SNAP funding and giving states information to calculate partial benefits for households.",
      "However, McConnell said Thursday that the administration\u2019s actions did not comply with his order to deliver the payments expeditiously and efficiently.",
      "\u201cPeople have gone without for too long. Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable,\u201d McConnell said, adding: \u201cThis should never happen in America.\u201d",
      "This is the first time SNAP benefits have lapsed because of a government shutdown in the program\u2019s 61-year history. Some families whose EBT cards were due to be reloaded already this week have reported skipping meals or subsisting on the meager foods remaining in their pantries, such as cereal or ramen.",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now, a person who relies on federal benefits like SNAP, or someone who is feeling the effects of other shuttered services in your everyday life.

      "\u201cThe President\u2019s determination was simply untethered to the facts,\u201d Immergut wrote.",

      "Its attorneys argued Trump's \"determination was amply justified by the facts on the ground.\"",
      "\"In the weeks and months preceding the President\u2019s decision, agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways, spray-painted violent threats, blockaded the vehicle entrance to the Portland ICE facility, trapped officers in their cars, followed them when they attempted to leave the facility, threatened them at the facility, menaced them at their homes, doxed them online, and threatened to kill them on social media,\" they said.",
      "The DOJ claimed that federal law enforcement needs the National Guard's help because they're \u201cunable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump hailed his deal to slash the price of blockbuster weight loss drugs as a game changer, promising to make Wegovy and Zepbound more affordable for millions of Americans.",
      "But major gaps in the plan could blunt its impact, drug policy experts say: Some of the drugs the administration has promised discounts on haven\u2019t been approved yet by the Food and Drug Administration; the lower prices for people paying out of pocket only appear to apply to the lowest doses of the drugs; and the deal doesn\u2019t expand Medicare coverage to people seeking treatment for weight loss alone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a situation where we have more questions than answers,\u201d said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. \u201cBased on what we didn\u2019t hear, that suggests to me that there\u2019s a lot that the administration itself hasn\u2019t even ironed out as of yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just feels,\u201d she added, \u201ca little bit too squishy right now.\u201d",
      "The announcement marks one of the most ambitious efforts yet to tackle the high cost of weight loss drugs in the U.S. Wegovy and Zepbound carry list prices above $1,000 a month, a cost that both Republicans and Democrats have criticized as far too high, especially compared with what other countries pay.",
      "Administration officials say there\u2019s still time to iron out details before the lower prices take effect. The lower prices that will be available through the administration\u2019s self-pay platform, TrumpRx, aren\u2019t expected to go live until the end of the year, and the Medicare and Medicaid changes won\u2019t roll out until mid-2026.",
      "\u201cI think the administration deserves credit for continuing to try to push the envelope on finding ways to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S.,\u201d Cubanski said. She said KFF polling shows that health care costs, including prescription drugs, are a top concern for Americans.",
      "Art Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said the deal, while ambitious, lacks crucial details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just murky as to how this will take shape, how the programs will work,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell from what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Unapproved drugs",
      "Several forms of the drugs included in the deal haven\u2019t yet received FDA approval. That includes oral versions of the weight loss drugs \u2014 which are still under development or FDA review \u2014 and Eli Lilly\u2019s new multidose injection pens, which haven\u2019t been approved but the drugmaker says are the versions included in the pricing agreement.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said that makes the administration\u2019s promises premature, since those lower prices can\u2019t take effect until the products are on the market.",
      "\u201cIt is reckless to negotiate pricing deals on products which the FDA have not yet approved as safe and effective,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cThe administration is getting way out ahead of its own safety agency.\u201d",
      "An oral version of Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, is being reviewed by the FDA. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.",
      "A multidose version of Zepbound is under review by the FDA, Lilly said. The company hasn't submitted its weight loss pill, orforglipron, to the agency yet.",
      "Lilly CEO David Ricks told NBC News\u2019 Tom Llamas on \u201cTop Story\u201d that the FDA would review the pill quickly. \u201cAs part of the deal, they\u2019ve agreed to give us an expedited approval,\u201d Ricks said.",
      "Different doses, different prices",
      "The White House said that both the pills and the injection pens will be available for discounted prices for people who pay out of pocket.",
      "Starting doses of weight loss pills will cost $149 for a month\u2019s supply, and the shots will cost an average of $350 for a month\u2019s supply, the White House said. The price of the injections is expected to fall to about $250 within two years, it said.",
      "But people may end up paying more.",
      "When people start on a weight loss drug, they start with the lowest dose possible \u2014 the starting dose \u2014 to allow the body to get used to the drug. Over the course of several months, however, they increase the dose until they get to a dose that\u2019s effective for weight loss. Wegovy comes in five doses and Zepbound comes in six, with the most weight loss seen at the highest doses.",
      "Administration officials said the starting doses of GLP-1 pills will cost $149 a month, but did not say what higher doses would be.",
      "For the injections, the exact White House language was vague: The shots will initially have a \u201cweighted average\u201d price of $350 a month. Lilly, however, said Zepbound will be available at the lowest dose for $299 a month, with additional doses priced up to $449. A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk didn\u2019t say whether doses would have different prices, but said it plans to publish an update on costs \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "That means patients paying through TrumpRx could end up paying far more than the administration\u2019s advertised prices \u2014 especially if patients don\u2019t stay on the lowest doses for long, Caplan said.",
      "Limited coverage",
      "As part of the deal, Lilly and Novo Nordisk will charge Medicare and Medicaid $245 for a month\u2019s supply of the shots, a move that will likely provide savings for the programs. Medicare enrollees will have their costs capped at $50 a month. Medicaid enrollees often don\u2019t have copays.",
      "But not everyone on Medicare or Medicaid is eligible.",
      "Under the deal, Medicare will continue to cover the weight loss drugs for people who are overweight or obese and have another qualifying condition, such as heart or kidney disease. The agreement doesn\u2019t expand coverage to people using the drugs for weight loss alone. Medicare, by law, is barred from covering weight loss drugs, Cubanski, of KFF, said.",
      "The lack of expanded coverage is a significant omission, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Medicare is one of the largest payers in the country, and without broader coverage, millions of patients will remain priced out even as the administration touts lower costs.",
      "\u201cYou would have to change the law or go through several regulatory steps to be able to offer coverage outside of an already covered indication,\u201d Dusetzina said.",
      "A White House spokesperson said the administration wanted to first lower prices for patients who would most benefit, such as those with risk factors associated with obesity.",
      "It\u2019s possible the administration could eventually expand Medicare coverage through a pilot program. Ricks, the CEO of Lilly, said at a briefing Thursday that the government plans to launch one in spring 2026 that would be voluntary for Medicare plans.",
      "Still, there are issues Medicare plans would have to weigh, Dusetzina said.",
      "\u201cThe plans will have to think about how many more people might be interested in enrolling and using these drugs and how that would affect their costs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, again, it\u2019s not totally clear to me how that will get operationalized and how soon Medicare beneficiaries would expect to see lower prices.\u201d",
      "Ricks said the pilot would be \u201cat no cost\u201d to the plans.",
      "Dr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Weight Loss Center in New Orleans, said the deal is \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but she worries if the administration is overstating the potential savings.",
      "\u201cAs an obesity community, I think we will remain skeptical of this deal until we see how it actually plays out,\u201d Levy wrote in an email."

Authorities never found Rogers\u2019 body. Nor did they identify a crime scene or a murder weapon.",
      "\u201cIf they had not gotten a flat tire, we probably wouldn\u2019t have solved this case,\u201d said Shane Young, the commonwealth\u2019s attorney for the state\u2019s 9th Judicial Circuit. \u201cThat phone call was the one hiccup in the plan because that phone call was not supposed to be made.\u201d",
      "For more on the case, tune in to \"The Trouble in Bardstown\" on \"Dateline\" at at 9 ET/8 CT tonight.",
      "In an exclusive interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d the veteran prosecutor reflected on the yearslong effort to bring justice to Rogers\u2019 family and to other unsolved homicide victims in Bardstown, the scenic small town in the heart of Kentucky\u2019s bourbon region where Rogers lived. Among the other victims is Rogers\u2019 father, Tommy Ballard, who was gunned down roughly a year and a half after his daughter vanished on July 3, 2015.",
      "At the time, Ballard, 54, was leading an effort to investigate his daughter\u2019s disappearance.",
      "Rogers\u2019 boyfriend, Brooks Houck, 44, was convicted of murder in Rogers\u2019 killing and sentenced to life in prison in September. His attorneys are appealing the verdict.",
      "Two men whom prosecutors identified as accomplices, Steve Lawson and his son, Joey Lawson, were convicted of conspiracy and tampering with physical evidence. Steve Lawson, 55, was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Joey Lawson, 34, was sentenced to 25 years to life. They\u2019re also appealing their convictions.",
      "In court, attorneys for the men said they were victims of police coercion \u2014 one of the lawyers described the interrogation tactics to \u201cDateline\u201d as \u201cthe Bardstown inquisition\u201d \u2014 and said there was no physical evidence linking them to the murder.",
      "A relationship on the rocks?",
      "Young was tasked with taking over the case as a special prosecutor in 2022. At trial, Young argued the couple\u2019s relationship was deteriorating. The killing, he said, was motivated by Houck\u2019s fear of losing custody of the couple\u2019s 2-year-old son. Rogers was likely killed at the Houck family farm, prosecutors have said.",
      "That theory was partly backed up by a cousin of Rogers\u2019 who testified that when she saw Rogers on July 3, Rogers said she and Houck were going on a surprise date that night.",
      "In interviews with police, Houck said he\u2019d last seen Rogers that evening, after they\u2019d gone to the farm for several hours with their toddler and walked around in the fields. Back at home, he said he fell asleep before Rogers did, according to a video of the interview.",
      "The next morning, Houck said that when he awoke, Rogers was gone \u2014 something he said she\u2019d done before when she needed space, according to the video.",
      "Jon Snow, the former Nelson County Sheriff's  detective who questioned Houck, pressed him for details during a follow-up interview. It was raining on July 3, Snow pointed out, but Houck said he\u2019d spent hours outside with their toddler.",
      "\u201cFour and a half hours is a long time to be outside in the rain, in the mud, with a 2 1/2 year old,\u201d Snow said. \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Houck responded.",
      "Problems on the parkway",
      "According to prosecutors, the Lawsons were responsible for getting rid of Rogers\u2019 car \u2014 a maroon Chevrolet Impala that was found, with a flat tire, on July 5 on the side of the Bluegrass Parkway.",
      "\u201cI think the plan was to make it look like she left,\u201d Young told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cWhether they were gonna drive the car into a lake or a river or whatever, I don\u2019t think the car was ever supposed to be found again.\u201d",
      "But then, according to the prosecution, Joey Lawson got a flat tire while driving the Impala. So he dialed his father, who then called Houck, Young said. (Joey Lawson has denied driving the car or playing a role in Rogers\u2019 disappearance.)",
      "The call was made around midnight and lasted just 13 seconds, according to Snow. In the follow-up interview with the detective, Houck said that he didn\u2019t recall what the conversation was about, but that it had been made by Steve Lawson, who worked for him.",
      "So Houck dialed Steve Lawson on the spot, a video of the interview shows.",
      "\u201cCan you remember what you asked me or what you were after?\u201d Houck said.",
      "\u201cSure, I can,\u201d Steve Lawson responded. \u201cI called and asked you for them numbers for the house.\u201d",
      "Steve Lawson initially denied having been on the parkway, though he later admitted it to a grand jury. Under questioning from investigators, he said that the phone call from his son was actually a request to pick him up on the parkway, a video of the interview shows.",
      "An FBI analysis of Steve Lawson\u2019s phone confirmed that he\u2019d been on the parkway, near the spot where Rogers\u2019 Impala was found on the night of her disappearance. At trial, Joey Lawson\u2019s attorneys disputed the analysis and said the phone actually showed Steve Lawson not on the parkway, but on a road parallel to it.",
      "The same FBI analysis showed that Joey Lawson had repeatedly called his father before Steve Lawson finally answered and made the 13-second call to Houck, according to Steve Keary, an FBI agent who investigated the case.",
      "Steve Lawson told authorities that when he arrived at the parkway, he found Rogers\u2019 Impala, got in and scooted the seat forward, a video of the interview shows. His son was taller than Rogers, he said, and Steve Lawson said he was worried his son had gotten caught up in something bad. Moving the seat, he told investigators, was his way of covering that up.",
      "Steve Lawson also told authorities that before Rogers\u2019 disappearance, Houck had described the couple\u2019s relationship as troubled and said he wanted her \u201cgone.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, \u2018gone\u2019 means gone,\u201d a video of the interview shows him saying.",
      "Making the case in court",
      "Even though investigators had only gathered circumstantial evidence, Young told \u201cDateline\u201d that he believed they\u2019d gathered enough to prove their case.",
      "In Houck\u2019s trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict in only a few hours.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if two people identified by prosecutors at trial as unindicted co-conspirators will face charges, he said.",
      "One of those alleged co-conspirators is Houck\u2019s brother, former Bardstown police officer Nick Houck. The department's former police, Chief Rick McCubbin, told \u201cDateline\u201d that he fired Nick Houck because McCubbin believed he hadn\u2019t fully cooperated with the investigation into Rogers\u2019 disappearance.",
      "Nick Houck has denied playing a role in the disappearance and has never been charged with a crime. His attorney did not respond to a detailed list of questions from \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say they have identified a possible link between Nick Houck and the killing of Rogers\u2019 father, Tommy Ballard, who was fatally shot while on a hunting trip with Rogers\u2019 11-year-old son on Nov. 19, 2016. In a court hearing and in his interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Young said that Nick Houck sold a gun to an undercover officer that investigators believe has the same or a similar caliber as the weapon used to kill Ballard.",
      "He sold the firearm using the name Nick Ballard, Young told \u201cDateline.\u201d Houck has not been charged with a crime in Tommy Ballard\u2019s death.",
      "Young is also investigating the killing of Bardstown police officer Jason Ellis, who was fatally shot on May 25, 2013, while clearing tree branches from an exit ramp on the Bluegrass Parkway \u2014 branches that investigators believe were placed intentionally. McCubbin said there was evidence the shooter had been lying in wait at the top of a nearby rock wall.",
      "Asked if he expects charges in either case, Young said: \u201cDon\u2019t know. We\u2019re working on them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is exploring buying  warehouses that were designed for clients like Amazon and  retrofitting them as detention facilities for immigrants before they are deported, a move that would vastly expand the government\u2019s detention capacity, according to a Homeland Security Department official and a White House official.",
      "The precise warehouses that Immigration and Customs Enforcement may buy have not yet been determined, but the agency is looking at locations in the southern U.S. near airports where immigrants are most often deported, the DHS official and the White House official said. Selecting such warehouses would  \u201cincrease efficiency\u201d in deportations, the DHS official said.",
      "A deal to purchase the warehouses, which on average are more than twice the size of current ICE detention facilities, is past the early stages but not yet final, the DHS official and the White House official said. The DHS official described the warehouses as future \u201cmega detention centers.\u201d",
      "Amazon would not be a part of any deal and would not profit from it as the warehouses were built by developers for Amazon but never used or leased by the company, the officials said.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is not involved in any discussions with DHS or ICE about warehouse space and that it leases and does not own the vast majority of its warehouse space.",
      "It was not immediately clear who owns the warehouses that the government may buy and the DHS official and the White House official did not know how much the deals could be worth. The DHS official said some of the warehouses under consideration were built by developers with Amazon in mind but never used.",
      "Any decision on whether to use such warehouses, or how many, has not yet been finalized, the DHS official said.",
      "The White House referred all questions on the matter to DHS and ICE. DHS and ICE did not respond to comment.",
      "Purchasing large warehouses would be the latest in a series of unconventional \u2014 and at times contentious \u2014 ideas in the Trump administration\u2019s search for immigrant detention space. The plans underscore ICE\u2019s ambitions to ramp up its detainment of immigrants on a large scale.",
      "ICE has struggled to hit daily arrest quotas and fill hiring goals, and some of its senior leaders are being replaced amid White House frustrations.",
      "Amazon warehouses range in size, averaging approximately 800,000 square feet. The largest is in Wilmington, Delaware, at  3.8 million square feet. By comparison, an ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, houses 1,500 immigrants in 277,000 square feet.",
      "The White House official said ICE would pay for the warehouses with funds from the budget reconciliation package that President Donald Trump signed earlier this year and calls the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d",
      "The warehouses would be owned by ICE outright and not contracted through the private prison industry or states, as is the case with other facilities, the DHS official and the White House official said.",
      "If the purchases are finalized, the idea is for ICE to convert the warehouses into detention facilities and likely run them with its own employees, not contractors or military personnel, the DHS official and the White House official said. Prior to the current administration, most ICE detention facilities were run by private prison contractors that both owned and staffed the building with federal funding.",
      "An NBC News poll released earlier this month noted that 51% of voters said the Trump administration has lived up to their expectations on border security and immigration, while 44% said it fell short of their expectations. In addition, 39% of registered voters said they view ICE favorably, while 50% said they view it unfavorably. A Pew Research Center survey from this summer noted, \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s overall approach to immigration is viewed more negatively than positively, with 42% approving and 47% disapproving,\u201d adding the sentiment was largely split along party lines.",
      "Since Trump retook office in January, after campaigning on a promise of mass deportations of immigrants, his administration has tried different approaches to detention facilities, with varied success.",
      "Trump charged the military earlier this year with holding immigrants in tents at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but the plan to hold tens of thousands of immigrants there did not materialize.",
      "The administration next turned to large scale detention of immigrants in tents in Fort Bliss, Texas. That effort hit hurdles during contracting and construction, but now houses over 2,000 immigrants. The administration also recently announced more state-run immigrant detention facilities in Florida, Louisiana and Indiana."

      "The Assemblies of God is facing calls for reform and repentance after an NBC News investigation revealed decades of sexual abuse allegations and alleged cover-ups within the world\u2019s largest Pentecostal denomination.",
      "The report last week identified nearly 200 ministers, church employees and volunteer leaders accused of sexually abusing more than 475 people, most of them children, over the past half-century. In dozens of cases, the investigation found, Assemblies of God churches returned accused offenders to ministry \u2014 freeing them to abuse again.",
      "In response, several Assemblies of God pastors said they were praying for a reckoning within their ranks. One urged the denomination to enter a season of repentance; another announced he was leaving in protest.",
      "\u201cI cannot in good conscience remain credentialed with the Assemblies of God,\u201d the minister, Trevor Walker, wrote in an email Wednesday to denomination leaders. \u201cI pray that greater light and humility will one day prevail in addressing abuse within the church.\u201d",
      "Walker was one of 10 current and former Assemblies of God ministers who shared their views with NBC News. Reporters also heard from several alleged victims and longtime congregants. Their reactions ranged from outrage and grief to deep disappointment. Some said they hoped the reporting would prompt change.",
      "\u201cMaybe this will be the thing that turns the corner,\u201d said Krystopher Scroggins, an Assemblies of God minister who leads a college ministry in San Angelo, Texas. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this amount of light shining in your dark corners and not want to clean your house.\u201d",
      "The General Council of the Assemblies of God, the denomination\u2019s U.S. governing body, released a video statement last week taking issue with the NBC News report and asserting its commitment to child protection.",
      "\u201cThe Assemblies of God grieves with anyone who has been hurt by the actions of an abuser,\u201d said General Superintendent Doug Clay, the denomination\u2019s top national leader. \u201cThe General Council of the Assemblies of God is committed to child safety and has an established track record of leadership in this area.\u201d",

      "An NBC News documentary traces the 40-year fight to stop a preacher accused of raping children.",
      "Some pastors praised the Assemblies of God for vetting credentialed ministers but were troubled by a significant gap noted in NBC News\u2019 report: Under denominational policy, only a church\u2019s lead pastor is required to hold ministerial credentials \u2014 meaning other staff, such as youth pastors or music ministers, can be hired without national oversight or background checks.",
      "Jim Line, who leads a small church in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, said he\u2019s concerned that this lack of supervision can allow individuals with troubling histories to return to ministry roles.",
      "\u201cIf you bring in somebody who\u2019s a minister of music or youth pastor and they\u2019re not credentialed, I don\u2019t know what your background is,\u201d said Line, who added that he otherwise thought the Assemblies of God\u2019s policies are strong. \u201cI do have a problem with that.\u201d",
      "NBC News contacted each elected member of the denomination\u2019s Executive Presbytery, which serves as a national board of directors, but none agreed to comment.",
      "At least a few of the Assemblies of God\u2019s 66 district councils, which oversee church affairs on a state or regional level, sent emails to ministers responding to the reporting. One district office implored every pastor in the region to voluntarily adopt child safety policies; another called the reporting \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and encouraged ministers to watch the General Council\u2019s response.",
      "For some inside the denomination, the video statement fell short, confirming fears that leadership is unwilling to confront what they see as systemic failures.",
      "Anthony Scoma, an Assemblies of God pastor in San Francisco who previously served as a district leader in north Texas, said failures that allowed sex offenders to return to ministry can\u2019t be fixed with policy changes alone. He called for \u201cchurchwide, denominationalwide repentance\u201d in response to the NBC News report.",
      "\u201cAs long as the Assemblies of God, led by our leaders, refuses to repent over a culture of abuse, the media, the courts, public opinion will continue to expose all these things,\u201d Scoma said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not actually them that\u2019s exposing it \u2014 it\u2019s God. It\u2019s the spirit of truth that is bringing these things to light.\u201d",
      "Among the most forceful reactions came from Walker, the minister who resigned his credentials after two decades in the Assemblies of God. Walker said he had already left his church in Midlothian, Virginia, in 2023 over its handling of a family member\u2019s abuse allegations but had maintained his credentials and hoped to one day return to ministry.",
      "The NBC News report and the denomination\u2019s response \u2014 which Walker described as \u201csterile,\u201d \u201cimpersonal\u201d and \u201cdevoid of accountability or compassion\u201d \u2014 finally convinced him to step away for good.",
      "\u201cIf they would have said, \u2018Many people have been hurt over the years under our watch, and we regret that, but we\u2019re working toward making it better,\u2019 that would have been enough for me,\u201d Walker said.",
      "Other ministers criticized a 2021 decision by the General Council to reject a resolution that would have added language to the bylaws stating that a credentialed minister or church could be expelled or disciplined for failing to enforce safeguards like background checks and mandatory reporting of abuse. Ministers declined to adopt the policy after lawyers for the denomination warned that it could expose the General Council to costly lawsuits.",
      "One senior official said at the time that the legal risk \u201coutweighed the benefit.\u201d",
      "That remark brought to mind a passage from the Book of Matthew, said Scroggins, in which Jesus warned that a person cannot serve both God and mammon \u2014 or money.",
      "\u201cWhen your guiding thought is, \u2018We don\u2019t want to implement this policy that will protect children because we don\u2019t want to lose a lot of money in potential lawsuits,\u2019 that to me is, you\u2019re worshipping money,\u201d Scroggins said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "Barrett, the Assemblies of God's general secretary, defended the 2021 decision in the video response last week. She said the denomination\u2019s structure gives churches broad autonomy to govern themselves, which she said \u201cmakes it impossible\u201d for the General Council to \"give oversight\" to local congregations.",
      "\u201cIt is absurd to think that anyone at 2021 General Council was opposed to child safety,\u201d Barrett said.",
      "Former Assemblies of God pastor Dan Matlock called that explanation hypocritical and \u201cfrankly, pardon me, bulls---.\u201d",
      "In 2020, Matlock\u2019s church in Kyle, Texas, announced it would affirm LGBTQ members and perform same-sex weddings. Within days, Assemblies of God district officials moved to revoke his ministerial credential and expel the church for adopting views \u201ccontradictory to historical Christian beliefs and our AG doctrinal positions,\u201d according to a letter reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Matlock said the episode showed that the Assemblies of God can exercise control over local church policies \u2014 when it\u2019s important to them.",
      "\u201cI am not convinced in the least that what they are most concerned about is congregants\u2019 safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Among rank-and-file Assemblies of God congregants, reactions to the NBC News report ranged from heartbreak to hope.",
      "Charity True, a longtime Assemblies of God member in Illinois, said \u201cJesus would be flipping tables\u201d at the Assemblies of God\u2019s national office.",
      "\u201cIf my local church didn\u2019t have their act already together, then last Sunday would have been my last Sunday inside of an Assemblies of God church,\u201d True said in an email, referring to her congregation\u2019s stringent child safety policies. \u201cI just pray this will bring change at a national level.\u201d",
      "For survivors, the revelations were deeply personal, reviving painful memories and exposing a pattern of abuse, silence and cover-ups.",
      "Cheryl Almond spent decades attending Assemblies of God churches in Oklahoma \u2014 even after she says her pastor, Joe Campbell, sexually abused her as a teen in the late 1970s. After other children came forward in the 1980s to allege abuse, Campbell was allowed to keep preaching for years before the denomination finally removed him in 1989, NBC News reported in May.",
      "Almond said she was devastated by the latest report, which she said confirmed a long-held fear: What happened at her childhood church wasn\u2019t isolated. \u201cThis has been allowed to happen to far too many kids, and for far too long,\u201d she said.",
      "In calling for change at the national level, Almond pointed to Jesus\u2019 parable of the shepherd who leaves 99 sheep to rescue one that has gone astray \u2014 a lesson about valuing every life.",
      "\u201cThe Assemblies of God isn\u2019t doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying that safeguarding the 99 is more important than protecting the one. \u2018That vulnerable child can fend for themselves. We\u2019ve got a church to protect from lawsuits.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not biblical, and it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d"

      "Viewers of \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d Season 2 are in for a tumultuous ride in the German teen drama\u2019s sophomore outing \u2014 if the opening shots of a crashed car are any indication.",
      "\u201cI just had a worst time on set,\u201d Damian Hardung, who stars as tortured rich bad boy James Beaufort, says. \u201cI\u2019m laughing now. I was crying then.\u201d",
      "Season 2 officially dropped on Prime Video Nov. 7 with the first three episodes, each clocking in around one hour. Like Season 1, it will have six episodes, with one new episode dropping each week until Nov. 28.",
      "Season 2 picks up right where last season left off. Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten) is confident she and James had reconciled their relationship after he called it off due to a threat from his dad. Meanwhile, James is reeling from the death of his mother, Cordelia.",
      "In the final moments of Season 1, a bereft James stumbled to Ruby\u2019s house. As he peered into her kitchen window, he saw a smiling Ruby surrounded by her parents and sister. But when Ruby looked up, he was gone.",
      "\u201cI love that shot of me looking in and just deciding that I don\u2019t want to destroy her life because I know what my family entails,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "The first episode of Season 2 alone sets the stage for plenty of heartbreak \u2014 so much so that star Herbig-Matten says she had to learn how to separate herself from her character after shooting.",
      "\u201cWhen we shot Season 1, I was 18. ... I think in Season 2 I achieved to separate her emotions from mine, and that was really healthy for me,\u201d Herbig-Matten says. \u201cI know I\u2019m safe, and when we had really intense and emotional scenes, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my life and it\u2019s not hurting me.\u201d",
      "Below, Hardung and Herbig-Matten break down the first few episodes of Season 2 \u2014 including a shocking betrayal \u2014 and set the stage for what\u2019s ahead.",
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Spoilers ahead for the first three episodes of \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d Season 2.",
      "Why Does James Cheat on Ruby?",
      "People who\u2019ve read Mona Kasten\u2019s \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d book series \u2014 the first of which was published in English July 1 \u2014 won\u2019t be surprised by Episode 1\u2019s big twist.",
      "\u201cEveryone who read the book knows that originally, the kiss with Elaine was at the end of the first book,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "After the death of his mother, and after he decides not to confide in Ruby, James temporarily goes missing. His twin sister, Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), also starts looking for James. They eventually find him drunk, mid-bender at a raging pool party. Ruby watches his out of control partying in horror. After telling Ruby she doesn\u2019t belong there, he kisses his old flame Elaine in the pool right in front of her.",
      "Ruby walks home alone from the party inconsolable.",
      "The next morning, James wakes up dazed, confused and horrified at what happened.",
      "Hardung describes the kiss as part of a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d depiction of James\u2019 grief. His character tries to push away Ruby because he knows the public spectacle his family brings, especially in the wake of his mother\u2019s death, Hardung says.",
      "In addition to self-isolation and drinking, James also turns to drugs. As his father announces Cordelia\u2019s death at a press conference outside their house, James is inside, using cocaine.",
      "\u201cWe took the time to truly acknowledge his period of grief and to tackle the loss, and I think we were brutally honest about it,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "\u201cI just hope fans are willing to go on that suffering journey with him,\u201d he adds. \u201cI feel like that was my main goal, to make them root for him or feel for him even though he is so inherently flawed and even though he f---- so badly \u2014 to still make people understand that this is the best that he can do at that certain time.\u201d",
      "Why Does Ruby Go Back to James?",
      "So to recap: Less than 15 minutes into Season 2, Ruby and James\u2019 relationship is again on the rocks. But this is \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d after all.",
      "When Ruby witnesses James cheat on her, she doesn\u2019t yet know about his mother\u2019s death. The next morning, still reeling from the kiss and the mounting pressure of a scholarship opportunity, her best friend tells her Cordelia Beaufort had died.",
      "Without hesitating, she goes to the Beaufort mansion to attempt to comfort James.",
      "\u201cI think Ruby has a really good heart, and I think when she loves someone, she loves them deeply, and she gives them everything,\u201d Herbig-Matten says of her character\u2019s decision to go to James\u2019 side. \u201cI think that was no question because she just want to show him that she\u2019s thinking about him and to show her presence, and also to be there for Lydia. I think that was also really important for her.\u201d",
      "Ruby finds James on the bathroom floor. His eyes well as she holds him. Through tears he says he regrets being mean to Cordelia the last time he saw her. He eventually falls asleep in Ruby\u2019s lap.",
      "But after Ruby checks his phone and sees a video message from Elaine from the night before, Ruby starts to withdraw. James tries to apologize and says Elaine means nothing to him. He begs her to stay, but when Ruby tells him he needs help, he shouts for her to leave.",
      "Hardung says he and Herbig-Matten were \u201creally afraid\u201d of this scene specifically.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the the shooting schedule, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, s--- it\u2019s coming up in two weeks,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "In this scene, Hardung says his character is lying to himself.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a scene objective really clearly \u2014 it\u2019s almost written on my head, \u2018I need you to stay. I need you to love me.\u2019 And then it breaks into, \u2018I need you to leave.\u2019 Out of a fear that I\u2019m not going to achieve my goal, and I can\u2019t stand failing again because I fail so much. So I\u2019d rather change my goal and lie to myself than to fail miserably again,\u201d he says of James.",
      "After James\u2019 mom\u2019s funeral at the end of the first episode, he hijacks a car and goes on a rampage. He tries to call Ruby, and when she doesn\u2019t answer, his driving gets more and more out of control until he spins out and flips the vehicle.",
      "In Episode 2, once he\u2019s released from the hospital, James again apologizes to Ruby and says he wants to fight for her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t save you, James, only you can,\u201d she finally says, a callback to the name of the second book in the series.",
      "This line sets the stage for Season 2\u2019s overall theme of \u201chealing,\u201d Herbig-Matten says.",
      "\u201cSeason 2 for me is about growth and about healing. And healing means sometimes to fall apart and to get yourself together again and to let people go,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned and what people can learn, and we see that she has to let him go and to heal himself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Readers have been upset to learn that the Farmers' Almanac is ceasing publication after more than 200 years in existence.",
      "No, not that one.",
      "The Nov. 6 announcement by the staff at the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac not only caused an outpouring of support for a publication that began in 1818, but also resulted in a competing farmer's almanac putting out a statement that it is still very much in business.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac, based in New Hampshire, issued a news release on Nov. 7 clearing up any confusion by noting that it is \"still going strong.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Why Is the Farmers' Almanac Shutting Down?",
      "The Farmers' Almanac, based in Lewiston, Me., announced that it is ceasing publication due to the \"growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment,\" the company said in a news release.",
      "Access to existing digital content on its website will be discontinued in December.",
      "\"First we want to tell everyone that this decision was very hard to make,\" Farmers' Almanac editor Sandi Duncan told TODAY.com in an email. \"The Almanac has been published each and every year since 1818 \u2014 even when the editor (Ray Geiger) was overseas serving in World War II. And we also recognize that it\u2019s more than just a book \u2014 it\u2019s a way of life \u2014 a tradition \u2014 a resource for so many people for so many years.\"",
      "\"However, readers now access information and answers differently, and the trajectory of newsstand sales made this decision necessary,\" she continued. \"The financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment, unfortunately lead to this decision.\"",
      "The 2026 Farmers' Almanac will be the final edition of a publication that began in 1818. It features weather forecasts, astronomy tidbits and predictions like the best days to ski, brew beer, plant tomatoes and view meteor showers.",
      "Duncan, who has worked at the publication since 1994, spoke about what she hopes the legacy of the long-running publication will end up being.",
      "\"To remind people to stop and smell the roses,\" she said. \"To appreciate all the wonders of nature, to realize that there is so much we can learn from the natural world even if we live among concrete skyscrapers.\"",
      "The announcement left readers upset at the loss.",
      "\"Sadly another treasured memory will disappear but will never be forgotten,\" one person commented on the Farmers' Almanac website. \"Have read FA since I was a kid, now 70.\"",
      "\"No way! Please tell me it isn\u2019t so,\" another wrote. \"I have had the FA in my home every year since I was 19 years old. I am now in my 70\u2019s. The wit, wisdom, and weather have been like a wonderful old friend to me.\"",
      "\"Please don\u2019t go. I\u2019ve grown up with you and want to keep growing older together,\" another commented. \"Not ready for you to leave. Please reconsider.\"",
      "What Is the Difference Between the Farmer\u2019s Almanac And the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac?",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac is based in Dublin, N.H., and has been in existence since 1792.",
      "The Farmer's Almanac is based in Lewiston, Me., and was in existence since 1818.",
      "The editors of the Old Farmer's Almanac released a statement on Nov. 7 in case readers were confused thinking it was going out of business.",
      "\"You may have heard that the Farmers' Almanac, based out of Lewiston, ME, is ceasing publication after an incredible 200+ year run,\" the statement reads. \"Over the years, there has been some confusion between different almanacs, so to be clear: The OLD Farmer\u2019s Almanac isn\u2019t going anywhere. As we have since 1792, during George Washington\u2019s presidency, we will continue to publish our annual edition, while educating and entertaining readers online at Almanac.com.\"",
      "The 2026 Old Farmer's Almanac will feature new gardening books, digital tools, calculators and seasonal weather forecasts. The book also includes gardening knowledge, astronomy and folklore material.",
      "\"Rest assured, as sure as the Sun will rise, The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac \u2014 with our familiar yellow cover and 80% accurate weather forecasts \u2014 will be around for generations to come,\" the statement concluded."

    "story": [
      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

      "Carroll, a 37-year-old Virginia middle school teacher, is in the upper echelon of the fandom and her recent viral TikTok post showed just how much the long-running procedural drama means to her.",

She knew exactly what it was when I said it, which just goes to show how many fans there are out there.\u201d",
      "In just 10 minutes, a tribute to \u201cSVU\u201d was permanently etched into her skin. She later showed the ink to friends and family, who she says were amused. The vice principal at her school playfully rolled her eyes and shook her head when she saw it.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go places with this tattoo.\u2019 And look who I\u2019m talking to!\u201d (Her students were especially excited when the video climbed to 6.7 million views, thanks to the term \u201c67\u201d flooding TikTok.)",
      "Carroll was shocked by the response on social media, with the video reaching 1 million views in just one day. \u201cI was like, I guess I found my people,\u201d she says about the TikTok going viral. \u201cAll the comments were amazing. I was so happy to see that it was mostly positive.\u201d There were some critics, but she adds that many fans were impressed and laughed at the inside joke.",
      "Although the tattoo is a funny way to express her love for \u201cSVU,\u201d Carroll shares that she has a heavier connection to the ink and the series.",
      "\u201cI think another reason that this show really resonates with me is because one in four women has been sexually assaulted,\u201d she says, a statistic confirmed by an article published on the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website. \u201cMyself included.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a weightlifter. I\u2019m not necessarily a small person. I\u2019m 6 foot 1 and I never thought that it would happen to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cI always thought that if I was in that position, I would fight back, or I would put them in their place. And I froze. Olivia\u2019s character tells people that all the time on the show.\u201d",
      "Carroll became emotional while explaining how Olivia\u2019s repeated message that sexual assault victims are not at fault has helped her.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that people are gonna people, and all we can do is survive. Like she tells a lot of the victims on the show, the whole point was that you got out of it. You made it through to the other side. It\u2019s just an unfortunate but good connection to have with that character.\u201d",
      "She also applauds Hargitay for using her platform to speak about sexual assault, particularly the rape kit backlog.",
      "\u201cThis is real life,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cThese are real (stories). Obviously, you know the little disclaimer in the beginning, but it\u2019s still real situations. These are real events that women, especially, have to go through.\u201d"

      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",

It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

    "story": [
      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility. All\u2019s Fair forgets that balance \u2014 and the result is a show that feels out of touch with the moment we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

      "Tom Bergeron is putting his dancing shoes back on.",
      "The former host of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d will return to the hit ABC series, now in Season 34, for its Nov. 11 episode. He\u2019ll appear as a guest judge to help celebrate the show's 20th anniversary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anticipating that it\u2019s going to be a wonderfully emotional, nostalgic night,\u201d Bergeron told TV Insider.",
      "\u201cIn the audience will be a number of past champions and competitors,\" he added. \"There\u2019s a special dance challenge that is going to factor into the anniversary night that will evoke even more nostalgia. It\u2019s going to be great. And I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s so much fun to watch my friends do the work. I don\u2019t have to throw to commercials. I don\u2019t have to worry about the timing.\u201d",
      "Bergeron also said he will happily play second fiddle to current co-host Alfonso Ribeiro, who competed on the show in 2014 before becoming a host in 2022. Julianne Hough joined as his co-host in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be respectful and sensitive of what Alfonso has to deal with, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just looking forward to being in an environment surrounded by people I really care about on live television, where there\u2019s no second take. It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d",
      "As for what viewers can expect to see from Bergeron at the judges' table?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very similar to my hosting style: somewhat loose and unpredictable,\u201d he said.",
      "Why Did Tom Bergeron Leave 'Dancing with the Stars'?",
      "Bergeron was the original co-host of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d when it premiered in 2005. He remained in the role, winning one Emmy for his work on the show, until he left the series in 2020 after he objected to the casting of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",
      "Bergeron, who was replaced at the time by Tyra Banks, said he had previously been assured no political figures would compete on the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Guys, this is exactly what we said we wouldn\u2019t do,\u2019\u201d Bergeron said of his reaction to the casting during a 2023 appearance on dancer Cheryl Burke's \u201cSex, Lies, and Spray Tans\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cAnd I would have responded the same way if they had booked Hillary Clinton, whom I voted for. \u2018Don\u2019t go there. This is, you know, not the right time. Play to our strengths. Be the show that gives people a break from all this bulls---.\u2019 So, I was furious,\u201d he added.",
      "After Spicer was cast in 2019, Bergeron posted his disapproval in a since-deleted post on Twitter, now X.",
      "\u201cA few months ago, during a lunch with DWTS\u2019 new Executive Producer, I offered suggestions for Season 28,\u201d Bergeron wrote. \u201cChief among them was my hope that DWTS, in its return following an unprecedented year-long hiatus, would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations. I left that lunch convinced we were in agreement.\u201d",
      "He said the casting decision was not his to make.",
      "\u201cIt is the prerogative of the producers, in partnership with the network, to make whatever decisions they feel are in the best long term interests of the franchise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it\u2019s their call. I\u2019ll leave it to them to answer any further questions about those decisions.\u201d"

      "The podcaster, who is married to country musician Jelly Roll, said she eventually decided that she wanted a different life for herself.",
      "\u201cI got sick. Sick of humiliating myself, sick of always having to start over & sick of who I was as a human. I had to stop pointing fingers & realize, two things can be true: I was the problem & the solution,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Bunnie said she relied on her faith and can now see that these experiences helped shape the person she is today.",

      "Bunnie acknowledged that she\u2019s still \u201clearning\u201d and \u201chealing\u201d and shared a motivational message with her followers.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in your own rock-bottom season right now, I need you to know this- you can rebuild. You CAN rewrite your story & start believing in yourself. You are never too far gone for God to find you, love you, & lift you out,\u201d she wrote.",
      "After reading his wife\u2019s vulnerable post, Jelly Roll shared a message of support in the comments.",
      "\u201cI would have never became the man I am with out you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was your story that inspired mine, it was always you I was trying to be like. Im glad the world is about to hear the real perseverance , and see what God can really do. While people talked about us, judged us, wished on our downfall, we just stayed the course and believed what God had for us no man could take away. We overcome by the blood of the lamb and the power of out testimony. TESTIFY BABY! TESTIFY!\u201d"

      "Ariana Grande is asking fans to be kind after she revealed she will have to miss the \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d premiere in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",
      "Ahead of the film\u2019s release on Nov. 21, there are going to be multiple premieres around the world, including the first international event in the Brazilian city on Nov. 4. But a day before fans expected to see Grande, Cynthia Erivo and more cast members posing on the red carpet, the 32-year-old singer and actor announced on her Instagram story that she won\u2019t be able to attend the premiere due to a plane issue.",
      "\u201cBrazil, i can\u2019t believe this is happening and i am beyond devastated to be sending this message. a few hours ago, my team and i had to deplane our flight as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 11am tomorrow which means that i would not be making it in time for the Wicked For Good S\u00e3o Paulo premiere,\u201d she began in a lengthy statement posted Nov. 3. \u201cMy team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we\u2019ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time.\u201d",
      "Grande said she also looked into securing a private plane permit, but it was not possible given the short notice.",
      "\u201cI am so heartbroken that i\u2019m unable to be there with you all. we sincerely tried everything we could and i apologize from the bottom of my heart,\u201d she continued. \u201cPlease shower my incredible castmates with all of the love that i wish i could be showering you with and have the most beautiful celebration. and again, i am so, so very sorry.\u201d",
      "But it seems that some fans were not satisfied with Grande\u2019s explanation and apology. Hours before the S\u00e3o Paulo event, Grande returned to the social media platform to share another statement in which she encouraged fans to be more understanding.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t wish danger on us. we did everything we could and i promise you no one is more upset than i am, i promise,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted message on her Instagram story Nov. 4 and included a heart. \u201cNo matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn\u2019t try \u2026 there was no other time for me to leave and these plans have been booked for months.\u201d",
      "She shared that she has had a busy schedule recently, balancing finishing another film and working \u201call day\u201d the past two days. Grande also added that she was scheduled to fly to Brazil the same day as co-stars Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, as well as director Jon M. Chu, but her flight issues altered their plans.",
      "\u201cSo please know how disappointed i am \u2026 sending lots of love to you all,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a beautiful and safe night. i love Brazil, i always have, i always will.\u201d",
      "Although fans won\u2019t get to witness Glinda and Elphaba reunite in S\u00e3o Paulo, they\u2019ll have other opportunities to see the duo together again this month. There will be a \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d global tour, including a  premiere in Paris on Nov. 7, one in London on Nov. 10, another in Singapore on Nov. 13 and a New York City premiere on Nov. 17.",
      "NBC is also airing a special on Nov. 6 titled \u201cWicked: One Wonderful Night,\u201d featuring songs from the first movie sung by the all-star cast. The two-hour special airs at 8 p.m. ET and will steam the following day on Peacock.",
      "The other film Grande was referring to in her post was the upcoming sequel \u201cFocker-In-Law.\u201d She announced on Instagram Oct. 31 that she had wrapped filming for the flick, out next November. \u201cThese past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes\u2026 so, so very much \u2661 i will miss this bunch terribly,\u201d she captioned a series of photos that showed her with a few cast members, including Ben Stiller."

      "The journey from the RSF-controlled city of el-Fasher to the town of Tawila is just 30 miles, but nonetheless perilous as gunmen rove around, robbing people, taking them hostage and in some cases slaughtering them by the dozen, the organizations say.",
      "Under international pressure, the RSF said Thursday that it was willing to engage in a U.S.-brokered humanitarian ceasefire. But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",

      "Two years ago, Derek and DeAnna Huffman were desperate to leave Humble, a suburb of Houston. Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier has entered service, Chinese state media said Friday, in a major step for the world\u2019s largest navy as it seeks to challenge U.S. dominance in the Pacific.",
      "The Fujian is China\u2019s third aircraft carrier but the first to be both designed and built domestically. It features an electromagnetic catapult system that allows for aircraft launches with heavier payloads compared with existing launch systems, according to CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping presided over the carrier\u2019s commissioning on Wednesday at a military port on the island of Hainan in a ceremony attended by over 2,000 naval officers and construction personnel, CCTV said.",
      "Both of China\u2019s previous aircraft carriers used a ski-jump type system, which is unable to handle fighter jets carrying heavier loads or large support aircraft. Its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was made by the Soviet Union while its second, the Shandong, was built in China based on the Soviet model.",
      "The Fujian\u2019s three electromagnetic catapult positions \u201cwere particularly noticeable\u201d along the flight deck, the CCTV report said, which also featured China\u2019s new carrier-based jets: the stealth-fighter J-35, the heavy-fighter J-15T, and the early-warning aircraft KJ-600.",
      "Though the Chinese navy is the world\u2019s largest, the U.S. navy, with its 11 aircraft carriers, is still considered the most advanced.",
      "Under Xi, China\u2019s navy has undergone rapid modernization with the goal of being able to go head-to-head against America\u2019s. China has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "Experts say the Fujian and the other two carriers could be crucial assets in the event of conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "China\u2019s neighbors are closely watching its military developments.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the aim of the Chinese military is to enhance its operational capabilities in distant waters and airspace through the strengthening of their naval forces,\u201d Minoru Kihara, Japan\u2019s top government spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo on Friday.",
      "He said China was \u201cexpanding its military capabilities extensively and rapidly, without sufficient transparency,\u201d adding that Japan was monitoring Chinese military activity in the area and would \u201crespond calmly but also resolutely\u201d if necessary.",
      "The commissioning of the Fujian comes two months after China held a massive military parade in Beijing that showcased its most advanced weapons.",
      "The Fujian, which was launched in 2022 and began sea trials in May 2024, is only the second aircraft carrier in the world to use an electromagnetic catapult system after the latest American carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Most American carriers use older steam catapult technology that China has bypassed.",
      "But the Fujian lags behind in one key area: nuclear power.",
      "All American carriers are nuclear-powered, meaning they have virtually unlimited range, while the Fujian, which is the world\u2019s largest conventionally powered warship, is estimated to have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles.",
      "That could change, however, as China may be developing a nuclear-powered supercarrier, NBC News reported in March.",
      "All three Chinese aircraft carriers \u2014 the Liaoning, the Shandong and the Fujian \u2014 are named after coastal provinces."

      "Hours after the announcement, a State Department spokesperson indicated the U.S. was still working to get both sides \u2014 the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese military \u2014 to agree a truce.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage directly with the RSF and SAF to facilitate a humanitarian truce,\" the spokesperson said, referring to the Sudanese Armed Forces. \"We urge both sides to move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce.\"",

      "The sanctuary says on its website that the lions \u201ccome at enormous cost to maintain.\u201d",
      "\u201cFeed, supplements, experienced staff, compound and grounds maintenance, vets, and more all exert pressure on our purse,\u201d it says."

      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",

      "While Asian markets pared some of their losses from earlier in the day, the indices closed lower across the board, which economists said was an indicator of how reliant tech companies, even in Asia, are on the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere are some Asian economies \u2014 Taiwan the most, followed by South Korea \u2014 that are really dependent on U.S. tech companies,\u201d said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.",

      "Last week, the Kospi hit a record high, fueled by gains in AI stocks. Taiwan\u2019s benchmark index, TWI, has gained 20% this year, driven in part by the 40% gain seen by TSMC, which supplies chips to Nvidia and other tech companies.",
      "But on Wednesday, the months-long rally came to a grinding halt after overvaluation warnings from Wall Street, resulting in a steep selloff, with shares of global electronics giant Samsung falling 5.5% and chipmaker SK Hynix dropping more than 6%.",

Matters were made worse by lackluster earnings Tuesday afternoon from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer, both of which manufacture chips used for AI services.",
      "Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and the companies that produce AI services has been overflowing for months. Companies from Amazon to Microsoft to OpenAI have announced a steady stream of multibillion-dollar deals with one another, raising questions over the sustainability of the industry and its sources of funding.",
      "U.S. stocks are coming off a remarkable run, repeatedly setting recent record highs. For the year so far, the S&P 500 is still up more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite, which more closely tracks the largest tech companies, has still gained more than 20% this year.",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" he said.",
      "The term kinetic strike can generally describe deploying launched or fired munitions, but can also mean a strike from a moving aircraft, such as a drone.",
      "Hegseth did not provide the exact location of the strike or the evidence of the trafficking operation claims. The Trump administration has provided more information about the groups involved or the origin country of crew members in previous strikes.",

      "Koza-Culp\u2019s discovery was made possible by the Names Database at Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. And now, the very database that helped Koza-Culp find her family has reached an important milestone: Yad Vashem has recovered the names of 5 million of the estimated 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators.",
      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",
      "Yad Vashem\u2019s organized effort to restore Jewish victims\u2019 names began in the 1950s and has stretched across generations, powered by survivors, their descendents and researchers determined to ensure every victim is honored.",
      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from New York City, and Paul Goldman reported from Jerusalem."
