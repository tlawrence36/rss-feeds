      "The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster",
      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",
      "A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:",
      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",

      "Salman Rushdie is among those being honored at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio",
      "DAYTON, Ohio -- DAYTON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Salman Rushdie was among the honorees Sunday at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio, receiving a lifetime achievement award after publishing his first work of fiction since being stabbed on a New York lecture stage three years ago.",
      "The prizes honor both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement. The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.",
      "The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which includes a dream sequence about the Prophet Muhammad that prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding. He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant \u2014 who wasn't born when \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published \u2014 was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "In accepting his award, Rushdie said it can be difficult to write about peace while living in a time of \u201cinexcusable violence,\u201d including the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.",
      "\u201cA book cannot stop a bullet. A poem cannot intercept a bomb,\" he said.",
      "But through literature, he said, writers can express solidarity with those who are suffering and others on the front lines of conflict zones, such as journalists.",

      "Authorities said Rushdie's attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for his death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target the writer at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, \u201cKnife,\u201d in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d which includes three novellas and two short stories.",
      "Other past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, feminist movement icon Gloria Steinem and writers Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, and Studs Terkel. The lifetime achievement award, also known as the Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.",
      "Other honorees this year include Kaveh Akbar for his novel, \u201cMartyr!\" about a poet and son of Iranian immigrants dealing with a mysterious family past, and Sunil Amrith, for \u201cThe Burning Earth,\u201d a history of how the global environment has been shaped by empires, wars and humanity's increasing freedom of movement.",

      "On the heels of the worst box office weekend of 2025, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d faced little competition from new titles. Not accounting for inflation, the $40 million opening marked a new high for the dreadlocked alien franchise, besting the $38.3 million launch of 2004\u2019s \u201cAlien vs. Predator.\u201d",
      "\u201cPredator: Badlands,\u201d written and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, collected another $40 million overseas for the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s 20th Century Studios. A key factor for \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d is that, with a budget of $105 million, it\u2019s also the most expensive \u201cPredator\u201d film.",
      "\u201cBadlands,\u201d the eighth movie in the franchise that began with 1987\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d offers a novel twist for the sci-fi series. On a remote planet, a young, outcast predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) encounters an android researcher (Elle Fanning), and the two set off on a journey. Reviews (85% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been good. Moviegoers gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Good news had lately been hard to find in movie theaters. On Wednesday, AMC Theaters, the largest theater chain, posted a $298.2 million quarterly loss, partly due to a less-than-stellar summer season. But the fall has been worse. Last month was the lowest-grossing October in nearly three decades. Few awards hopefuls have made much of a mark.",
      "This weekend, a new wave hit theaters. But despite plenty of star power, most fell flat.",
      "\u201cDie My Love,\u201d starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, launched with $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay, stars Lawrence as a new mother and Pattinson as her husband. Mubi plunked down a reported $24 million for \u201cDie My Love\u201d after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Audience slammed it with a \u201cD+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the professional boxer Christy Martin, debuted with $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. The film, the first one distributed by production company Black Bear Pictures, has earned Sweeney awards buzz since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.",
      "Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 \u201cNuremberg,\u201d a post-World War II drama about the Nuremberg trials starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, managed to do a bit better. It opened with $4.1 million in 1,802 theaters.",
      "It was slightly edged by the best performer of the newcomers: \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil.\u201d The Amazon MGM release opened with $4.5 million from 2,410 locations. It stars Naya Desir-Johnson as a young Black girl in the early 1900s who learns that her Oklahoma land allotment is rich with oil. \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil\u201d scored a rare \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from ticket buyers.",
      "Arguably the most promising of the prospective awards movies to open in theaters over the weekend was Neon\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d The film, a prize-winner at Cannes, directed by Norwegian-Danish filmmaker Joachim Trier, has been tabbed as a major Oscar contender this year. The family drama\u2019s cast includes Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and, in her second movie of the weekend, Elle Fanning.

It also broke a short streak of disappointments for the studio, including \u201cTron: Ares\u201d and \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d With potentially two of the biggest box-office hits of the year still to come in \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney is poised to surpass $5 billion.",

      "A clip of the BBC \u201cPanorama\u201d episode shared by The Daily Telegraph appears to show different parts of Trump\u2019s speech edited into one quote. In the episode, Trump is shown saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol and I\u2019ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",

Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

    "story": [
      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "The report is the 20th edition of the annual tracking by GLAAD and charts a remarkable leap from just 47 LGBTQ+ characters in the first study.

      "France's court of auditors has urged the Louvre museum to prioritize security modernization",
      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

      "The court of auditors, which is an independent body, recommended that the Louvre focuses on priorities including bringing the museum\u2019s technical facilities, particularly safety and security, up to standards, and cut its expenses in other areas. That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",

      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",

      "Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren\u2019t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some \u201cenvironmental\u201d trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",
      "Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury \u2014 but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.",
      "Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women\u2019s vulnerability.",
      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",
      "Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.",
      "According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That\u2019s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.",
      "Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.",

      "Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson\u2019s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.",
      "That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman\u2019s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her immune system had been attacking her own body all that time and nobody caught it.",
      "\u201cI just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,\u201d she said.",
      "Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms \u2014 and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues\u2019 gallery of autoimmune diseases that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide \u2013 hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine\u2019s biggest mysteries.",
      "Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They\u2019re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones \u2013 in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.",
      "It's a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in multiple sclerosis, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sj\u00f6gren's disease, destroys insulin production in Type 1 diabetes, weakens muscles in myositis and myasthenia gravis \u2014 and in lupus, it can cause body-wide havoc.",
      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",
      "\u201cYou look normal. People see you and they don\u2019t think you have this horrible disease,\u201d said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.",
      "While there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.",
      "In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients' own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It's called CAR-T therapy and early results with these \u201cliving drugs\u201d are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.",
      "And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they\u2019ll need insulin. Citing that \u201ctantalizing evidence,\u201d the NIH\u2019s new five-year plan for autoimmune research \u2014 if it gets funded \u2014 urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,\u201d said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",
      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don\u2019t have savings, that\u2019s really devastating,\u201d Brandon said.",

      "Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in an interview with The Associated Press that \u201cthe relationship has to continue across a range of issues\u201d despite trade pressures as she prepared to host U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.",

      "Canada's G7 hosting duties this year have been marked by strained relations with its North American neighbor, predominantly over Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports. But the entire bloc of allies is confronting major turbulence over the Republican president's demands on trade and various proposals to halt worldwide conflicts.",
      "One main point of contention has been defense spending. All G7 members except for Japan are members of NATO, and Trump has demanded that the alliance partners spend 5% of their annual gross domestic product on defense. While a number of countries have agreed, others have not. Among the G7 NATO members, Canada and Italy are furthest from that goal.",
      "There have also been G7 disagreements over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with Britain, Canada and France announcing they would recognize a Palestinian state even without a resolution to the conflict. With the Russia-Ukraine war, most G7 members have taken a tougher line on Russia than Trump has.",
      "The two-day meeting in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Lake Ontario near the U.S. border comes after Trump ended trade talks with Canada because the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S. that upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump's insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologized for the ad and said last week that he\u2019s ready to resume trade talks when the Americans are ready.",
      "\u201cThe work that we are doing in the G7 is about finding areas where we can cooperate multilaterally,\u201d Anand said. \u201cThis conversation will continue regardless of other efforts that we are making on the trade side.\u201d",

      "\u201cEvery complex relationship has numerous touch points,\" Anand said. \"On the trade file, there is continued work to be done \u2014 just as there is work to be done on the numerous touch points outside the trade file, and that\u2019s where Secretary Rubio and I come in because the relationship has to continue across a range of issues.\"",
      "Anand said Rubio asked her during a breakfast meeting in Washington last month to play a role in bringing countries to the table to ensure that Trump\u2019s Gaza ceasefire plan has longevity.",
      "U.S. officials said Rubio, who also may have meetings with other G7 counterparts and at least one of the invited non-G7 foreign ministers, would be focused on initiatives to halt fighting in Ukraine and Gaza, maritime security, Haiti, Sudan, supply chain resiliency and critical minerals.",
      "Canada\u2019s priorities include ending the war in Ukraine, Arctic security and security in Haiti. There will be a working lunch on energy and critical minerals that are needed for anything from smartphones to fighter jets. Canada has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Anand will probably try to use the meeting to improve the working relationship with Rubio, said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "\"Yet, a key factor shaping that relationship is beyond her control: President Trump\u2019s mercurial behavior,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "\u201cThe expectations are quite low, but avoiding drama and fostering basic common ground on issues like Ukraine and Russia would be helpful,\" B\u00e9land said.",

      "BERLIN -- Visitors to Germany's highest peak will have to do without the landmark gilded cross at its summit for the next few weeks.",
      "A helicopter on Tuesday lifted the cross from the 2,962-meter (9,718-foot) peak of the Zugspitze \u2014 a mountain shared between Germany and Austria in the Bavarian Alps \u2014 for restoration. Why? Because visitors keen to leave their mark have plastered it with stickers over the years.",
      "The cross, which is 4.88 meters (16 feet) tall and weighs 300 kilograms (661 pounds), is being taken to the workshop of craftswoman Andrea W\u00fcrzinger in nearby Eschenlohe, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "W\u00fcrzinger plans to carefully remove the thick layer of stickers, sand the iron underneath and then add new gold leaf where needed. With gold prices high, she said that \u201cwe want to try to gild it only where there is no longer gold.\u201d",
      "The current cross was made by her father, Franz W\u00fcrzinger, in 1993, replacing the original from 1851, which was damaged beyond repair. She said that, when it was first re-gilded after about 15 years, there were three stickers on it; in 2017, there were about 70; and now there are hundreds.",

      "Selfies around the cross are sought-after and the area can get crowded and slippery on busy days. Not all visitors come with suitable shoes. Some resort to risky acrobatics to put stickers on an uncovered part of the cross.",
      "In July, a replica cross was inaugurated inside the summit station in hopes that people will take their selfies and slap their stickers there instead of risking the climb to the peak.",
      "W\u00fcrzinger and the Bayerische Zugspitzbahn, the operator of the railway and cable cars that lead to the summit from the German side, hope the work will be finished and the cross back in place in time for the beginning of the ski season on Nov. 28.",

      "The European Union has given a U.N.-affiliated body hundreds of millions of dollars to help thousands of African migrants return from failed journeys to Europe and support them back home",
      "CONAKRY, Guinea -- When Oumar Bella Diallo boarded a plane home to the West African nation of Guinea in July, the weary 24-year-old thought his migration ordeal was over.",
      "He had spent almost a year trying to reach Europe. He said he was attacked by police and scammed for money as he crossed Mali, Algeria and Niger, at one point limping past corpses in the desert. After seeing fellow migrants die from hunger and exhaustion, he gave up.",
      "He is among tens of thousands of Africans returning home with the help of the International Organization for Migration, as Europe spends millions of dollars to deter migrants before they reach its shores. The European Union-funded IOM program pays for return flights and promises follow-up assistance.",
      "But migrants tell The Associated Press that promises by the United Nations-affiliated organization are not fulfilled, leaving them to face trauma, debt and family shame on their own. Desperation could fuel new migration attempts.",
      "The AP spoke to three returnees in Gambia and four in Guinea, and was shown a WhatsApp group of over 50 members founded around returnees' frustration with the IOM. They described months of reaching out to the IOM with no reply.",
      "Diallo said he told the IOM he wanted to start a small business. But all he has received is a phone number for an IOM counselor and a five-day orientation course on accountability, management and personal development. He said many returnees had trouble grasping it because of low education levels.",
      "\u201cEven yesterday, I called him,\u201d Diallo said. \u201cThey said for the moment, we have to wait until they call us. Every time, if I call them, that\u2019s what they tell me.\" He said he asked for medical help with a foot injured on his migration attempt but was told it was impossible.",
      "As the oldest child of a single mother, the responsibility for supporting relatives weighs heavily.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s not so much money, you\u2019re the head of the family too,\u201d he said.",
      "The IOM program is financed almost completely by the EU and was launched in 2016. Between 2022 and 2025, it repatriated over 100,000 sub-Saharan migrants from north Africa and Niger.",
      "Of the $380 million budget for that period, 58% is allocated for post-return assistance, the IOM said.",
      "Francois Xavier Ada with the IOM regional office in West Africa told the AP that over 90,000 returnees have started, and 60,000 completed, the reintegration process \u201ctailored to individual needs.\" Ada said that can \u201csupport anything from housing, medical assistance or psychosocial services to business grants, vocational trainings and job placement.\u201d",
      "Migrants told the AP they had not received any of those.",
      "Ada said the IOM was \u201dconcerned\" to learn of people kept waiting and \u201chappy to look into these cases.\u201d He added that delays can occur due to high caseloads or incomplete documentation, and medical assistance is not guaranteed.",
      "Experts said there is little insight into how the EU money helps returnees. The European Court of Auditors, an EU body, audited the program's first phase between 2016 and 2021 and said it failed to demonstrate sustainable reintegration results, monitoring was \u201cinsufficient to prove results\u201d and the EU \u201ccould not prove value for money.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe EU policy is obsessed with returns,\u201d said Josephine Liebl with the Brussels-based European Council on Refugees and Exiles. \u201cThe question of how this support actually helps people in very vulnerable situations receives very little public scrutiny, which is due to the fact that there is such a lack of transparency and accountability of how EU funding works outside the EU.\u201d",
      "The EU did not respond to questions on the details of the budget beyond repeating IOM statements.",
      "Moustapha Darboe, a Gambian journalist who interviewed over 50 returnees for an investigation into the IOM program, said they had to wait a long time, often almost a year, and support they eventually received did not match their skills and ambitions.",
      "\u201cThe IOM is donor-based,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cTheir primary focus is not to help these people, their primary focus is to tick their box.\u201d",
      "The IOM program has coincided with Europe's other efforts to deter migration, including paying some African governments to intercept migrants, an approach denounced by human rights groups that accuse African authorities of being complicit in abuses.",
      "Europe's efforts appear to be working. In the first eight months of 2025, it recorded 112,000 \u201cirregular\u201d crossings, over 20% less than the same period last year, and a drop of over 50% from two years ago.",

      "New Zealand's government has announced changes to firearms laws Tuesday which include ending police officer involvement in gun regulation",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand\u2019s government will end the involvement of police officers in regulating gun ownership, an official said Tuesday as she announced sweeping firearms law reforms.",
      "The move is intended to ease tensions between the gun regulator and firearms owners, which have been fraught since the agency's creation following a shooting massacre at two New Zealand mosques.",
      "The Firearms Safety Authority has overseen gun ownership since 2022 after an inquiry underlined the way the white supremacist attacker legally acquired numerous weapons without attracting law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "The changes unveiled in Wellington by Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee stopped short of what the police union and those bereaved in the Christchurch massacre feared: a reversal of the near-complete ban on semiautomatic firearms passed after the attacker killed 51 Muslims at prayer on March 15, 2019.",
      "McKee, a lobbyist for gun owners before she entered parliament in 2020, told reporters her bid to relax the semiautomatic weapons ban for some sports shooters wasn\u2019t approved by the Cabinet. Her government had refused to rule out reversing the ban before.",
      "Instead, her changes focused on removing uniformed officers from the regulatory body and altering its oversight. Once McKee's law passes, the authority will report directly to the government, rather than the head of the New Zealand Police.",
      "\u201cThere will be no blue shirts in the Firearms Safety Authority,\u201d McKee said, referring to police uniforms. The 15 officers who worked at the authority would return to police duties, which will still include enforcing gun crime laws.",
      "\u201cWe need to rebuild the trust and confidence between the regulator and the licensed firearms community that has diminished severely over the past six years,\u201d said McKee. She said \u201ca lot of the blame\" for the Christchurch attack was directed at gun owners, who say police should be focusing on law enforcement, not on regulation compliance or licensing.",
      "The regulator is currently a unit within the police department. The law change would create a more independent legal structure that would only share corporate services with the law enforcement agency.",
      "The body couldn't be entirely separated from the police department due to a reliance on law enforcement databases, McKee said.",
      "The Australian attacker, who moved to New Zealand to carry out the massacre, was granted a license and legally amassed semiautomatic weapons after being radicalized online. Lawmakers changed the rules after the attack to require more information from applicants, such as travel histories, and tighter policies about character referees which might have raised questions when Brenton Tarrant applied for a license.",

      "New Zealand drew global admiration when its then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said six days after the massacre that the weapons used would be banned. Further reforms included new gun club rules and a firearms registry.",
      "McKee, who opposed most of the changes as a lobbyist, left many untouched in the law rewrite. She said the focus was on simplifying regulations so law-abiding gun owners could comply more easily.",
      "That included extending renewal windows for licenses, which sometimes lapse due to backlogs, and allowing more flexibility in where licensed gun owners can store their weapons. The small number of New Zealanders permitted semiautomatic weapons for pest control will be allowed to hold their licenses for longer.",
      "The new law would also introduce a so-called red flag system enabling other government agencies to share information with the regulator. It would strengthen controls on 3D-printed gun manufacturing, though it stops short of what police had urged.",
      "The legislation replacing the Arms Act was still being drafted and wasn\u2019t publicly available Tuesday. McKee said it would be introduced to Parliament before year\u2019s end and she hoped it would pass by mid-2026. Her libertarian party, Act, is part of a three-party, center-right coalition government that has enough lawmakers to pass the reforms outright.",
      "A spokesperson for the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, which McKee previously led, said the group welcomed the removal of police from gun licensing. Hugh Devereux-Mack said the structure of the regulator had resulted in \u201cunfair and intimidating treatment\u201d of gun owners.",

      "TORONTO -- Top diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies are converging on southern Ontario as tensions rise between the U.S. and traditional allies like Canada over defense spending, trade and uncertainty over President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan in Gaza and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in an interview with The Associated Press that \u201cthe relationship has to continue across a range of issues\u201d despite trade pressures as she prepared to host U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Anand also invited the foreign ministers of Australia, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine.",
      "She said \u201c15 foreign ministers are coming from around the world to the Great White North and funnily enough on the week of our first large snowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work that Canada is doing is continuing to lead multilaterally in an era of a greater movement to protectionism and unilateralism,\" Anand said. \u201cAnd in an era of economic and geopolitical volatility.\u201d",
      "Canada's G7 hosting duties this year have been marked by strained relations with its North American neighbor, predominantly over Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports. But the entire bloc of allies is confronting major turbulence over the Republican president's demands on trade and various proposals to halt worldwide conflicts.",
      "One main point of contention has been defense spending. All G7 members except for Japan are members of NATO, and Trump has demanded that the alliance partners spend 5% of their annual gross domestic product on defense. While a number of countries have agreed, others have not. Among the G7 NATO members, Canada and Italy are furthest from that goal.",
      "There have also been G7 disagreements over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with Britain, Canada and France announcing they would recognize a Palestinian state even without a resolution to the conflict. With the Russia-Ukraine war, most G7 members have taken a tougher line on Russia than Trump has.",
      "The two-day meeting in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Lake Ontario near the U.S. border comes after Trump ended trade talks with Canada because the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S. that upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump's insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologized for the ad and said last week that he\u2019s ready to resume trade talks when the Americans are ready.",
      "\u201cThe work that we are doing in the G7 is about finding areas where we can cooperate multilaterally,\u201d Anand said. \u201cThis conversation will continue regardless of other efforts that we are making on the trade side.\u201d",

      "\u201cEvery complex relationship has numerous touch points,\" Anand said. \"On the trade file, there is continued work to be done \u2014 just as there is work to be done on the numerous touch points outside the trade file, and that\u2019s where Secretary Rubio and I come in because the relationship has to continue across a range of issues.\"",
      "Anand said Rubio asked her during a breakfast meeting in Washington last month to play a role in bringing countries to the table to ensure that Trump\u2019s Gaza ceasefire plan has longevity.",
      "U.S. officials said Rubio, who also may have meetings with other G7 counterparts and at least one of the invited non-G7 foreign ministers, would be focused on initiatives to halt fighting in Ukraine and Gaza, maritime security, Haiti, Sudan, supply chain resiliency and critical minerals.",
      "Canada\u2019s priorities include ending the war in Ukraine, Arctic security and security in Haiti. There will be a working lunch on energy and critical minerals that are needed for anything from smartphones to fighter jets. Canada has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Anand will probably try to use the meeting to improve the working relationship with Rubio, said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",

      "Air travelers could face more frustration as U.S. airports need to meet a higher FAA target for reducing flights",
      "Air travelers could face more frustration as busy U.S. airports need to meet a higher Federal Aviation Administration target for reducing flights Tuesday after already canceling thousands to scale back demands on the nation\u2019s aviation system during the government shutdown.",
      "The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at 40 major U.S. airports, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already canceling more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday and again to 10% on Friday.",
      "But it was unclear exactly how many additional flights would need to be canceled Tuesday. The average cancellation rate over the last few days already exceeded the FAA\u2019s requirement, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. The FAA also expanded its flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits.",
      "However, controller shortages continued to lead to flight delays, including one of about five hours for arriving flights Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to staffing-related disruptions earlier in the day. The FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could delay planes departing for Phoenix, San Diego, the New York area and Houston, among other cities.",
      "Freezing weather in parts of the country on Tuesday could cause further delays and cancellations.",
      "The Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, but the bill still needs to clear the House and final passage could be days away. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made clear last week that flight cuts will remain until the FAA sees staffing levels stabilize at its air traffic control facilities.",
      "Many planes also aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be, which could slow the airlines\u2019 return to normal operations even after the FAA lifts the order, said Mike Taylor, who leads research on airports and airlines at J.D. Power.",
      "Todd Walker said he missed his mom\u2019s 80th birthday when his flight was canceled over the weekend.",
      "\u201cAll of this has real negative consequences for millions of Americans, and it\u2019s 100% unnecessary and avoidable,\u201d he said.",

      "HONG KONG -- Alice Zhang, a 29-year-old marketer in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, has spent only roughly half what she did last year during the \u201cSingles' Day\u201d online shopping festival, switching to cheaper choices and giving up on buying new shoes after pay was cut by more than 20%.",
      "That's typical, analysts say, of the trend for the extended discount campaign that is China's equivalent to Black Friday sales, initiated by China\u2019s Alibaba in 2009 as a 1-day event on Nov. 11 -- Double 11 in Chinese parlance, and considered a symbol of unattached singles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a conscious effort to cut back,\u201d said Zhang, who spent around 3,000 yuan ($421) this year.",
      "Singles\u2019 Day spending is closely watched by observers and economists as an indicator for the wider economy. This year, the sales period began as early as Oct. 9, several days earlier than in 2024, and will finish this week.",
      "Chinese retail data provider Syntun said that as of Oct. 31, the combined gross value for this year\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day had topped 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion). In 2024, it estimated sales rose about 26% year-on-year to 1.44 trillion yuan.",
      "It remains to be seen if the appetite for spending may finally be recovering after the pandemic and a prolonged downturn in the property market.",
      "Boosting domestic demand such as consumer spending and business investment is a top priority for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "Economists and analysts say spending on big ticket items remains downbeat as value-minded shoppers focus on necessities and more affordable goods.",
      "\u201cConfidence remains quite downbeat among households,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.",
      "The early launch for this year\u2019s festival partly reflects the desire of the online retailers that are its main organizers to compensate for weakness in the consumer economy, said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt by (major Chinese e-commerce) players like Alibaba and JD.com to drum up business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people have been complaining that the discounts (this year) are not very strong,\u201d said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst, adding that she observed a stronger sense of \u201cconsumer fatigue.\u201d",

      "The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be nearing an end, but not without leaving a mark on an already-struggling economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be nearing an end, but not without leaving a mark on an already-struggling economy.",
      "About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Thousands of flights have been canceled, a trend that is expected to continue this week even as Congress moves toward reopening the government. Government contract awards have slowed and some food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be retaken, missed restaurant meals won't be made up, and some postponed purchases will end up not happening at all.",
      "\u201cShort-lived shutdowns are usually invisible in the data, but this one will leave a lasting mark,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at accounting giant EY said, \"both because of its record length and the growing disruptions to welfare programs and travel.\u201d",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost.",
      "The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. It only nicked the economy by about 0.02% of GDP, the CBO said then.",
      "The current shutdown is adding to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. Still, few economists foresee a recession.",
      "About 650,000 federal workers didn't work during the shutdown, which will likely boost the unemployment rate by about 0.4 percentage points in October, or to 4.7% from 4.3% in August, when the last report was released. Those workers would all then be counted as employed once the government reopens.",
      "Here are the ways the government closure is weighing on the economy:",
      "All told, federal workers will have missed about $16 billion in wages by mid-November, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy.",
      "Trump had threatened during the shutdown to not provide back pay but the deal struck in Congress would replace those lost wages once the government reopens.",
      "The shutdown has added to the Washington, D.C. area's economic woes, where the unemployment rate was already 6% before the shutdown, after Trump's cuts to the federal workforce this spring caused job losses. While the Washington, D.C. area \u2014 including the nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland \u2014 has the highest concentration of federal workers, most live and work outside of the nation's capital.",
      "Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. But they also comprise 2.9% of New Mexico's workers, 2.6% of Oklahoma's, and 3.8% of Alaska's.",
      "Then there are the federal contractors. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "Airlines scrapped more than 2,000 flights by Monday evening after canceling 5,500 since Friday on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is seeking to reduce the burden on overworked air traffic controllers, who have now missed two paychecks.",
      "Even before the flight cancellations, Tourism Economics, an economic consulting firm, estimated that the shutdown would reduce travel spending by $63 million a day, which means a six-week standoff would cost the travel industry $2.6 billion.",

      "Consumer sentiment dropped to a three-year low and close to the lowest point ever recorded in a survey by the University of Michigan, reported Friday, with pessimism over personal finances and anticipated business conditions weighing on Americans.",
      "The November survey showed the index of consumer sentiment at 50.4, down a startling 6.2% from last month and a plunge of nearly 30% from a year ago.",
      "While the shutdown hasn't cut off all federal government spending, it has reduced purchases of equipment and has cut off the issuance of new contracts.",
      "Yaros estimates that about $800 million in new contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day of the shutdown.",
      "\u201cThe federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Yaros wrote.",
      "The shutdown delayed the payment of $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid to 42 million recipients in November, creating a significant financial disruption for many households that likely reduced spending. Some states have managed to pay full benefits for this month, though the Trump administration is still fighting over the issue in court.",
      "The deal currently under consideration in Congress to reopen the government includes full funding of SNAP benefits.",
      "The government shutdown cut off the flow of economic data on unemployment, inflation, and retail spending that the Federal Reserve depends on to monitor the economy's health. Even as the government reopens, some of that data will still be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month.",
      "Powell said the Fed's interest-rate setting committee is deeply divided over whether to reduce its key rate, partly because the economy's health is unusually cloudy right now. The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued.",
      "Powell said a rate cut in December was not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d and added that the lack of data could contribute to a decision by the Fed to skip a rate cut at its next meeting December 9-10. Fewer rate cuts could discourage borrowing and spending and weigh on the economy in the coming months.",

      "Retirement saving requires key decisions: when to start, how much to save, and where to invest. The investing decision has drawn more attention as government regulators work to open 401(k) plans to alternative assets such as private market investments.",
      "Below, we compare the paths of two hypothetical retirement savers and their outcomes.",
      "Laura and JR are two 25-year-olds newly employed at the same company, in the same role.",
      "On her first day at work, Laura committed 10% of her $75,000 salary to her 401(k). That earned her company\u2019s 3% annual match (it matches 50% up to 6%), and 13% in total savings. She still had room in her budget for weekends filled with activities.",
      "JR was more worried about now. Rather than putting money into a 401(k) he wouldn\u2019t touch for decades, he enjoyed his $75,000 salary. Five years later, JR began to build his nest egg. He opted for the minimum contribution rate to qualify for the company match, contributing 6% with a 3% match.",
      "Laura and JR\u2019s employer offered many investment vehicles, including target-date funds. One invested only in public stocks and bonds; the other kept a 15% allocation to private equity and private credit across the glide path.",
      "Laura preferred the public-only target-date fund for its simplicity and transparency. JR was also drawn to the target-date options and their ease of use. However, he went with the private market option since it promised higher returns, and to make up for his late start. He figured he could quickly recover five years of missed contributions, given that he had 35 years until retirement.",
      "Laura and JR both rose steadily to senior management positions. Their career progression, and their salaries, stayed in tandem. By the time they were turning 65 and approaching retirement, each was earning $178,620 a year. There had been no changes to their 401(k) contribution rates or their company\u2019s matching formula. As Laura and JR prepared to retire, they reviewed their 401(k)s.",
      "For JR, the target-date fund with private markets had paid off. Over 35 years of investing, the fund delivered an annualized return of 8.9%, compared with 8.4% for the public-only option. This left him with a balance of about $2 million. Combined with Social Security, JR felt that he could enjoy retirement without the risk of outliving his savings.",
      "The public-only TDF underperformed compared with the private markets TDF, but Laura didn\u2019t mind. Over 40 years of investing, her 401(k) account balance grew to more than $3 million. By starting earlier and contributing more she harnessed the power of compounding returns to a much greater extent than JR had.",
      "JR\u2019s private markets sleeve gave him a small edge, but Laura\u2019s decision to start saving earlier and save more made the real difference. Compounding did the rest, turning her steady contributions into a balance far larger than JR\u2019s.",

      "The bottom line: It is far better to focus on how much to save and when to start saving, instead of the whims of the public and private markets.",
      "In illustrating the importance of saving early and saving more, we had to make several assumptions. We assumed that Laura and JR earn the same salary and stay at the same employer for their entire careers, with no breaks in employment. We assumed stocks, bonds, and private markets all delivered the long-term return expectations set by Morningstar Investment Management. It\u2019s not a given that a target-date fund with a 15% allocation to private markets would outperform a similar strategy focused solely on public stocks and bonds, especially after fees.",
      "There is debate about whether private equity funds outperform their public counterparts. A Morningstar analysis concluded that private equity funds are best thought of as another form of active management, where a handful of funds may significantly outperform their peers, but median returns are similar (or worse) to public market funds.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Billionaire Warren Buffett warned shareholders Monday that many companies will fare better than his Berkshire Hathaway in the decades ahead because of its massive size though others might say the company's prospects will dim because \u201cFather Time\u201d is catching up with the 95-year-old icon who plans to step down as CEO in January.",
      "Buffett reflected on life and his health in a new letter to shareholders where he announced $1.3 billion in new charitable gifts to the four family foundations run by his children that \u2014 along with the Gates Foundation \u2014 have been helping steadily give away his fortune since 2006.",
      "Berkshire is known for consistently outperforming the stock market during the past 60 years under Buffett \u2014 which helped earn him legions of fans \u2014 although that has become harder to do in recent years because of the huge size of the conglomerate. Berkshire owns Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several large utilities and a diverse assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses, including such well known brands as Dairy Queen, See's Candy and Helzberg Diamonds. But Buffett also reassured shareholders that he remains confident in his successor.",
      "Buffett promised to keep in touch with shareholders through Thanksgiving letters in the future, but he confirmed that next year Greg Abel will take over Buffett's famous yearly letter and answer all the questions at the annual meeting after he becomes CEO in January. Buffett will remain chairman.",
      "Buffett said that \u201cthrough dumb luck, I drew a ridiculously long straw at birth\u201d by being born in Omaha, Nebraska, where he met many lifelong friends \u2014 including several who helped shape Berkshire's fortune \u2014 and both his wives after attending public schools. He said he has been fortunate to have his life saved three times by doctors who lived nearby while managing to avoid the kind of calamities that often cut life short.",
      "Buffett recounted spending several weeks in the hospital after having his appendix out as a child where he turned to fingerprinting all the nuns who were taking care of him just in case they turned to a life of crime later. Buffett previously battled prostate cancer in 2012, but that wasn't considered life threatening.",
      "\u201cThose who reach old age need a huge dose of good luck, daily escaping banana peels, natural disasters, drunk or distracted drivers, lightning strikes, you name it,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Buffett said he is moving slowly and now has increasing difficulty reading, but he continues to go into the office five days a week to hunt for useful business ideas or deals that could benefit Berkshire.",
      "Berkshire shareholders should have faith in Abel because Buffett said he has consistently met the high expectations he has for him. \u201cHe understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don\u2019t even consider. I can\u2019t think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government \u2013 you name it \u2013 that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\u201d Buffett wrote.",
      "Berkshire\u2019s fortress-like balance sheet, highlighted by the $382 billion cash it holds, ensures the company is unlikely to encounter a devastating disaster, and Buffett said the board remains conscientious of shareholders\u2019 interests, but still the company will have trouble outperforming.",
      "\u201cIn aggregate, Berkshire\u2019s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,\u201d Buffett said.",

      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",

      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track",
      "WASHINGTON -- A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services, the longest in history.",
      "What's in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied. The legislation provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs, while also ensuring backpay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt.",
      "But notably lacking is any clear resolution to expiring health care subsidies that Democrats have been fighting for as millions of Americans stare down rising insurance premiums. That debate was pushed off for a vote next month, weeks before the subsidies are set to expire.",
      "President Donald Trump noted the deal as he arrived at the White House after watching the Washington Commanders' game on Sunday evening against the Detroit Lions, on the 40th day of the funding lapse. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re getting close to the shutdown ending,\u201d he said.",
      "The Senate could wrap up passage as soon as Monday. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle, 60-40, late Sunday, with eight Democrats joining most Republicans. In a rare dissent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against because it failed to fully address the health care funds.",
      "It would next go to the House, where lawmakers have been away since September but were being told to prepare to return to Washington this week. Then, it's to Trump's desk for his signature.",
      "Here's a look at the deal as it's moving through Congress:",
      "Included is funding to keep much of the federal government running for the next couple of months, to Jan. 30, with a stopgap measure. It largely funds government operations at their current rates.",
      "Yet in a breakthrough for what's considered a more normal appropriations process, the package also includes several bills to fully fund other government operations including agricultural programs and military construction along with veterans' affairs for the full fiscal year, through September 2026.",
      "Additionally, the package ensures states would be reimbursed for money they spent to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, running during the shutdown.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she was \u201crelieved.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis shutdown has gone on far too long,\" she said. \"And I also think it\u2019s highly significant that we\u2019ll have three yearlong appropriations bills attached. Veterans Day is coming very soon, and it would be wonderful if we get the full-year Veterans Affairs bill signed into law.\u201d",
      "The Democrats failed to secure their main demand during the shutdown, which was an extension of the health care subsidies that many of the 24 million people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act rely on to help defray costs.",

And three ultra-conservative GOP senators held up voting for more than two hours as they demanded consideration of their ideas. It is unclear if any of them plans to stage further protests.",
      "Democrats, who have fought for the past month in their hopes of preserving the health care subsidies, also could delay final passage, and their next steps are uncertain.",
      "And the package faces fresh scrutiny once it goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana holds a slim GOP majority and would likely need almost all Republicans to support the bill in the face of objections from Democrats who are holding out for the health care funds.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party will fight the bill, forcing the Republicans in the House to pass it largely on their own.",

      "Air travelers should expect worsening cancellations and delays this week even if the government shutdown ends, as the Federal Aviation Administration rolls out deeper cuts to flights at 40 major U.S. airports, officials said Monday.",
      "The fourth day of the flight restrictions saw airlines scrap over 2,300 flights Monday and more than 1,000 flights set for takeoff Tuesday. Unpaid for more than a month, some air traffic controllers have begun calling out of work, citing stress and the need to take on second jobs.",
      "President Donald Trump took to social media on Monday to pressure controllers to \u201cget back to work, NOW!!!\u201d He called for a $10,000 bonus for those who've stayed on the job and suggested docking pay for those who haven't.",
      "Rep. Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Aviation Subcommittee, condemned the president\u2019s remarks, saying controllers deserve appreciation and support \u2014 not attacks.",
      "The head of the controllers union says its members are being used as a \u201cpolitical pawn\u201d in the shutdown fight.",
      "Meanwhile, the Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, though the bill also needs to clear the House and final passage could be days away. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made clear last week that flight cuts will remain in place until the FAA sees staffing levels stabilize at its air traffic control facilities.",
      "And because the flight disruptions are widespread and ongoing, many planes aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be, which could also slow the airlines\u2019 return to normal operations even after the FAA lifts the order, said Mike Taylor, who leads research on airports and airlines at J.D. Power.",
      "\u201cIf you think about it, there\u2019s all these aircraft that didn\u2019t fly where they were supposed to on a normal route,\u201d Taylor said, noting airlines will need to track down all their planes, figure out where each needs to be, and find pilots and cabin crew for those flights.",
      "Since Friday, airlines have canceled about 8,000 flights under orders to drop 4% of flights at 40 of the nation\u2019s busiest airports. That will rise to 6% on Tuesday and 10% by week's end, the FAA says.",
      "One in 10 flights nationwide were scratched Sunday \u2014 the fourth worst day for cancellations in almost two years, according aviation analytics firm Cirium.",
      "Controller shortages also led to five-hour delays Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to the disruptions earlier in the day, and the FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could cause delays in cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.",

    "story": [
      "The nonprofit CreatiVets is transforming a once-abandoned church in Nashville into a 24-hour arts center for veterans and a community hub",
      "NASHVILLE -- Richard Casper shakes his head as he touches one of the boarded-up windows in the once-abandoned church he plans to transform into a new 24-hour arts center for veterans.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Purple Heart recipient said he was an arm\u2019s length away from military officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, at Marine Barracks Washington when he learned the former church his nonprofit CreatiVets just purchased had been vandalized.",
      "The physical damage to the building and its stained glass windows saddened Casper. But what worried him more was that the church had remained empty since 2017 without damage. That vandalism came just weeks after CreatiVets bought it, suggesting that maybe he and the veterans in his program were not welcome.",
      "\u201cI almost just left,\u201d Casper said. \u201cIt put me in a weird headspace.\u201d",
      "However, Casper, 40, a CNN Heroes winner and Elevate Prize Foundation winner, needed more support for the center \u2014 \u201ca place to go when the PTSD hits.\u201d Like so many veterans, he said his PTSD, caused by seeing a close friend die on patrol in Iraq, would generally come in the middle of the night, when the only places open are bars and other spaces that can be \u201ddestructive.\u201d",
      "He figured a 24-hour center where veterans could engage in music, painting, sculpture, theater and other arts could help. It could \u201cturn all that pain into something beautiful.\u201d The artistic element factored in when Casper, who suffered a traumatic brain injury while serving in Iraq, returned home and found it hard to be in public \u2014 unless he was listening to live music.",
      "So he completed his mission that night in Washington, introducing new people to CreatiVets' work. Then, Casper returned to Nashville to practice what he has preached to hundreds of veterans since his nonprofit opened in 2013. He asked for help.",
      "And help came.",
      "Within weeks, CreatiVets\u2019 Art Director Tim Brown was teaching a roomful of volunteers how to create stained glass pieces to replace those that were vandalized. Brown said the volunteers wanted to give back to the organization, \u201cbut also because of the impact that these activities have had on them.\"",
      "Gary Sinise values that impact. The actor, musician and philanthropist had already signed on to donate $1 million through his foundation to help CreatiVets purchase the building. Sinise\u2019s involvement encouraged two other donors to help finalize the purchase.",
      "The \u201cCSI: NY\u201d star said he believed in CreatiVets\u2019 work and had already seen a similar program in his hometown of Chicago help veterans process their wartime experiences.",
      "\u201cIn the military, you\u2019re trained to do serious work to protect our country, right?\u201d Sinise said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the infantry, you\u2019re being trained to kill. You\u2019re being trained to contain any emotion and be strong.\u201d",
      "Those skills are important when fighting the enemy, but they also take a toll, especially when veterans aren\u2019t taught how to discuss their feelings once the war is over.",
      "\u201cQuite often, our veterans don\u2019t want any help,\u201d Sinise said. \u201cBut through art \u2013 and with theater as well \u2013 acting out what they are going through can be very, very beneficial.\u201d",
      "David Booth says he is living proof of how CreatiVets can help. And the retired master sergeant, who served 20 years in the U.S. Army as a medic and a counterintelligence agent, wishes he participated in the program sooner.",
      "\u201cFor me, this was more important than the last year and a half of counseling that I\u2019ve gone through,\u201d said Booth. \u201cIt has been so therapeutic.\u201d",
      "After years of being asked, Booth, 53, finally joined CreatiVets\u2019 songwriting program in September. He traveled from his home in The Villages, Florida, to the historic Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, to meet with two successful songwriters \u2013 Brian White, who co-wrote Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cBlame It on You,\u201d and Craig Campbell, of \u201cOutskirts of Heaven\u201d fame \u2013 to help him write a song about his life.",

      "He suffered a traumatic brain injury in the explosion, and it took months of rehab before he could walk again. His entire cervical spine is fused. He still gets epidurals to relieve the nerve pain. And he still suffers from nightmares and PTSD.",
      "In Iraq, Booth's unit was once surrounded by kids because American soldiers used to give them Jolly Rancher candies. Snipers shot the children in hopes the soldiers would become easier targets when they tried to help.",
      "\u201cThings like that stick in my head,\u201d Booth said. \u201cHow do you get them out?\u201d",
      "He also told them about his desire for a positive message and Combat Veterans to Careers, the veteran support nonprofit he founded. Those experiences became the song \u201cWhat\u2019s Next.\u201d",
      "Booth hopes \u201cWhat's Next\u201d becomes available on music streaming services so others can hear his story. CreatiVets has released compilations of its veterans' songs since 2020 in cooperation with Big Machine Label Group, Taylor Swift\u2019s first record label. This year\u2019s collection was released Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they could feel what I was feeling and put it into the lyrics,\" said Booth, after hearing the finished version. \"It was pretty surreal and pretty awesome.\u201d",
      "Sinise has seen the unexpected impact of art throughout his career. His Oscar-nominated role as wounded Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan Taylor in \u201cForrest Gump\u201d in 1994 deepened his connection to veterans. His music with the Lt. Dan Band expanded it. In 2011, he launched the Gary Sinise Foundation to broadly serve veterans, first responders and their families.",
      "\u201cI think citizens have a responsibility to take care of their defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are opportunities out there for all of us to do that and one of the ways to do it is through multiple nonprofits that are out there.\u201d",
      "Sinise immediately connected with CreatiVets\u2019 mission. When the idea came to dedicate the performance space at the new center to his late son Mac, who died last year after a long battle with cancer, Sinise saw it as \u201ca perfect synergy.\u201d",
      "\u201cMac was a great artist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he was a humble, kind of quiet, creative force\u2026 If Mac would have survived and not gone through what he went through, he\u2019d be one of our young leaders here at the foundation. He would be composing music and he\u2019d be helping veterans.\u201d",
      "Mac Sinise is still helping veterans, as proceeds of his album \u201cResurrection & Revival\u201d and its sequel completed after his death, are going to the Gary Sinise Foundation. And Gary Sinise said he discovered more compositions from his son that he plans to record later this year for a third album.",
      "After the new center was vandalized, Casper said he was heartbroken, but also inspired knowing part of the center was destined to become the Mac Sinise Auditorium. He decided to take pieces of the broken stained glass windows and transform them into new artwork inspired by Mac Sinise\u2019s music.",
      "\u201cI told you we\u2019re going to go above and beyond to make sure everyone knows Mac lived,\" Casper told Sinise as he handed him stained glass panes inspired by Mac Sinise\u2019s songs \u201cArctic Circles\u201d and \u201cPenguin Dance,\u201d \"not that he died, but that he lived.\u201d",
      "Sinise fought back tears as he said, \u201cMy gosh, that\u2019s beautiful.\u201d",
      "As he examined the pieces more closely, Sinise added, \u201cI\u2019m honored that we\u2019re going to have this place over there and that Mac is going to be supporting Richard and helping veterans.\"",

      "HONG KONG -- Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the U.S., has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa program targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.",
      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.",

      "\u201cBeijing perceives the tightening of immigration policies in the U.S. as an opportunity to position itself globally as welcoming foreign talent and investment more broadly,\u201d said Barbara Kelemen, associate director and head of Asia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly.",
      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",

      "ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company's Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They include lots 206VABP/251261P2 and 206VABP/251131P2, with best-by dates of December 2026.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\u201cThese mice got sick really quickly,\u201d Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula from the recalled batches.",
      "\u201cTesting unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\u201d the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula.",
      "The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",

      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cThis would be extremely rare,\u201d he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott recalled top brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \u201careas that still require corrective actions.\u201d",

      "The NFL has seen a surge in international interest, with the first batch of tickets for the first regular-season game in Spain selling out quickly",
      "MADRID -- The initial batch of tickets for the first regular-season NFL game in Madrid were gone in a matter of hours, with nearly 700,000 people trying to get a seat to watch the Miami Dolphins play the Washington Commanders on Sunday at Real Madrid\u2019s iconic Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.",
      "For the first game in Ireland last month, organizers said some 600,000 digital devices were logged on to try to buy tickets for the Pittsburgh Steelers' game against the Minnesota Vikings at Dublin\u2019s famed Croke Park.",
      "The demand has been similarly high in other cities hosting games in recent years, and more countries have been reaching out to the NFL. An NFL official says \"probably a day doesn\u2019t go by\u201d without a city saying they are interested in potentially hosting a game.",
      "The host cities themselves have treated the games as their Super Bowls, with a series of promotional events and fan activities planned in the weeks ahead and high-profile artists performing at halftime. They have generated massive fan interest locally and attracted fans from nearby European countries, allowing host cities to gain financially and in visibility.",
      "Gerrit Meier, managing director and head of NFL International, said organizers went into the game in Dublin last month with \u201ca real sense of a mini Super Bowl coming to town.\u201d",
      "There were NFL experiences and shops brought to iconic venues, and murals and light projections were visible throughout the Irish city. Similar activities were being promoted for Spain\u2019s inaugural game in Madrid.",
      "Puerto Rican superstar Daddy Yankee and Argentine producer Bizarrap are set to perform at halftime in Madrid. British singer Myles Smith was the star at halftime in Dublin, while Grammy award-winning artist Karol G performed in Sao Paulo in September. Grammy-nominated Kid Laroi was the headliner for Berlin's first regular-season game last week, while the games in London included shows by British singer Raye and British rapper Giggs.",
      "The three games played in London this season took the total there to 42 games since 2007, which is when the NFL officially kicked off its push to grow internationally with regular-season games abroad. The league has been aggressively expanding in recent years, and the seven games played internationally this season are the most ever for the NFL. Next year, it will go to Australia and add a game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",
      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has reiterated that the league plans to increase the number of international games to a point where each team will get to play a game abroad every year. He said in September that the NFL also wants to play in Asia. The league may also look at possible locations for a game in Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia could possibly be in the mix as well.",
      "\u201cProbably a day doesn\u2019t go by where someone on our international team doesn\u2019t receive outreach from a city or an entity interested in working with the NFL and potentially hosting a game,\u201d said Peter O\u2019Reilly, the NFL vice president in charge of international affairs. \u201dThere\u2019s very strong interest. I think cities have seen what it\u2019s like to host a game, and the visibility that it brings, as well as the magnet it is for people from that region, and more broadly, around the world to come in.\u201d",
      "The estimated economic impact for London since the first game was played there in 2007 has reportedly reached $2.6 billion. The first time the NFL played in Germany in 2022, the economic impact was more than $80 million for the Munich area, and Spain expects similar numbers, according to some local estimates.",
      "Real Madrid President Florentino P\u00e9rez said it was \u201ca great honor that a competition with the prestige of the NFL\u201d chose Madrid as host.",

      "More than 60 regular-season games will have been played abroad through this season, with London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Madrid, Berlin, Dublin and Toronto hosting them.",
      "\u201cOur historic first game in Madrid is a very exciting next step in the league\u2019s history,\u201d the NFL country manager for Spain, Rafa de los Santos, told The Associated Press. \u201cBeyond playing international games, and expanding our global footprint, we want to grow our presence in key markets around the world year-round, bringing more fans globally closer to our game, our clubs and our players.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Reilly said the league is excited about growing global momentum and the owners \u201ccontinue to prioritize global growth\u201d and work to establish a strategic foundation \u201cacross the league to become a true global sport property.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re now in a state where teams are very interested in raising their hand to play in certain markets, especially where they have global market rights, and we\u2019re hearing from more and more countries and cities who are interested in being part of these international games' road map,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.",
      "The league recently expanded its Global Markets Program, which awards teams international marketing rights to build brand awareness and fandom beyond the United States. Now all 32 teams participate in the program across 21 international markets \u2014 up from 25 clubs across 19 markets in 2024.",
      "The NFL teams have jumped on the opportunity to expand their brand internationally and have been riding the current wave of interest.",
      "\u201cWhen you play a game abroad, it\u2019s not just about the result on the field,\u201d said Dolphins vice president of international development Felipe Formiga, who leads the organization\u2019s brand development and growth strategy in international markets. The Dolphins will be playing their eighth regular-season game abroad, second only to the 14 played by the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s about celebrating American football internationally, about making history by playing in this first-ever game in Spain,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cThis movement by the NFL in recent years to motivate teams to expand internationally has presented us with great opportunities, and it has been a perfect match for the Dolphins, which already has in its DNA that aspect of being an international organization.\u201d",

      "The Masters to complete the career Grand Slam. A home Irish Open. An away Ryder Cup.",
      "It has been a year of unforgettable, career-defining wins for Rory McIlroy. There's a good chance it will get even better in Dubai this week in the Northern Irishman's final event of the 2025 season.",
      "The No. 2-ranked McIlroy will look to be crowned Europe's No. 1 player for a fourth straight year when he competes in the European tour's season-ending World Tour Championship starting on Thursday.",
      "If McIlroy holds off Marco Penge and Tyrrell Hatton \u2014 the only players in range of overhauling him \u2014 he will win the Race to Dubai title for the seventh time in his career and move within one of Colin Montgomerie's record haul.",
      "Montgomerie won his season-long points titles \u2014 when it was called the Order of Merit \u2014 each year from 1993-99 and again in 2005.",
      "McIlroy is tied on six with the late Seve Ballesteros, and remains committed to tailoring his schedule so he can play as many events on the European tour as possible while also working the PGA Tour calendar.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful heritage to this tour. I think with the fractured nature of the men\u2019s professional game at the minute, this tour needs all of its stars to step up and play in the big events,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "\u201cI understand that I am one of those people and I want to do my utmost to help in whatever way that I can.\u201d",
      "McIlroy said he was the happiest he has felt in a long time, on and off the golf course. He attributes some of that to stepping away from the wrangling at boardroom level brought about by the emergence of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf breakaway circuit.",
      "From being the face of strident anti-LIV criticism, McIlroy is back to being just a golfer.",
      "\u201cI have a clear head and I\u2019m out of all the political stuff in golf, basically, and I can just focus on playing and playing where I want to and making myself competitively happy by playing in the tournaments that I want to play,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd then having more time to make myself personally happy with doing the things I want to do away from golf. Travelling with my family and showing my daughter different parts of the world and doing things like that I think is a very nice place to be in life.\u201d",
      "McIlroy leads the Race to Dubai standings. He is around 767 points ahead of second-placed Penge and around 1,720 points ahead of third-placed Hatton. There are 2,000 points on offer for the winner at the Earth Course.",

      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201c(The) K-visa for China (is) an equivalent to the H-1B for the U.S.,\u201d said Srinivasagopalan, who is intrigued by China\u2019s working environment and culture after her father worked at a Chinese university a few years back. \u201cIt is a good option for people like me to work abroad.\u201d",
      "The K-visa supplements China's existing visa schemes including the R-visa for foreign professionals, but with loosened requirements, such as not requiring an applicant to have a job offer before applying.",
      "Stricter U.S. policies toward foreign students and scholars under Trump, including the raising of fees for the H-1B visa for foreign skilled workers to $100,000 for new applicants, are leading some non-American professionals and students to consider going elsewhere.",
      "\u201cStudents studying in the U.S. hoped for an (H-1B) visa, but currently this is an issue,\u201d said Bikash Kali Das, an Indian masters student of international relations at Sichuan University in China.",

      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",

      "Many Chinese parents still see Western education as advanced and are eager to send their children abroad, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.",
      "Still, in recent years, a growing number of professionals including AI experts, scientists and engineers have moved to China from the U.S., including Chinese-Americans. Fei Su, a chip architect at Intel, and Ming Zhou, a leading engineer at U.S.-based software firm Altair, were among those who have taken teaching jobs in China this year.",

      "Recruitment and immigration specialists say foreign workers face various hurdles in China. One is the language barrier. The ruling Communist Party's internet censorship, known as the \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d is another drawback.",

      "The world has seen faster climate change than expected since the Paris Agreement a decade ago",
      "The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.",
      "Earth's warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.",
      "There's been progress \u2014 more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 \u2014 but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think it's important that we're honest with the world and we declare failure,\u201d said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming's harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.",
      "But diplomats aren't giving up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.",
      "But the speed of humanity's climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate's harms, she said, adding that means that \"the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.\u201d",
      "U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is \u201cobviously falling behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,\u201d she said.",
      "The planet's annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.",
      "Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia's Siberia.",
      "Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.",
      "Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan,China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.",
      "Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world's glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That's the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.",
      "Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world's seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it's enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.",
      "Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.",

Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.",
      "\u201cThere's no stopping it,\u201d said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. \u201cYou cannot hold back the tides.\u201d",
      "In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.",
      "But that's nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement's overarching goal.",
      "\u201cTen years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,\" Rockstrom said. \"Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.\u201d",
      "A report examining dozens of indicators of progress \u2014 such as solar and wind power installations \u2014 in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.",
      "The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.",
      "\u201cTechnologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,\" said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. \"But it\u2019s not nearly fast enough for what\u2019s needed.\u201d",
      "Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.",
      "Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China's going up 15.5% and India's soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.",
      "Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,\u201d said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cUnfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can\u2019t say it\u2019s failed. But then nor can you say it\u2019s dramatically succeeded.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness.",
      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",
      "But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It\u2019s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn't involved in the study.

      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

      "He has shown \u201ca regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \u201cHis outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d",
      "Long before that, Watson scorned political correctness.",
      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",

(She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",

In her review, Jocelyn Noveck writes, \u201cThe chief weakness of \u2018Freakier Friday\u2019 \u2014 an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

      "\u201cThis was the last time we talked,\u201d he said.",
      "Early the next morning, the ground shook so hard, it was felt miles away. Roaring plumes of smoke billowed more than 100 feet into the sky from a raging fire. Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",

All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",
      "The worst ones have the number to her cellphone, which is never turned off. Sometimes they call in a panic, desperate for help.",
      "\u201c\u2018Lisa, I can\u2019t breathe! Lisa, what do I do?\u2019\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "On Thursday, Chan and Zuckerberg also announced that Biohub has hired the team at EvolutionaryScale, an AI research lab that has created large-scale AI systems for the life sciences. Alex Rives, EvolutionaryScale\u2019s co-founder, will serve as Biohub's head of science, leading research efforts on experimental biology, data and artificial intelligence. The financial terms were not disclosed.",
      "Biohub's ambition for the next years and decades is to create virtual cell systems that would not have been possible without recent advances in AI. Similar to how large language models learn from vast databases of digital books, online writings and other media, its researchers and scientists are working toward building virtual systems that serve as digital representations of human physiology on all levels, such as molecular, cellular or genome. As it is open source \u2014 free and publicly available \u2014 scientists can then conduct virtual experiments on a scale not possible in physical laboratories.",
      "Noting that Biohub launched when the couple had their first child, Chan listed off some of the organization\u2019s accomplishments, ranging from building the largest single-cell data set, contributing to one of the largest human cell maps, building sensors to measure inflammation in real-time in living cells and researching rare diseases.",
      "That work continues, with a focus on using AI to advance biomedical research.",
      "\u201cAnd to anchor it back onto the impact on patients, you know, why do this?\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why is a virtual cell important? We have cured diseases for mice and for flies and for zebrafish, many, many times. And that\u2019s great. But we want to make sure that we are actually using biology to push the forefront of medicine for people \u2014 and that is so promising.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

      "U.S. military leaders in Europe are also advocating for the creation of an Eastern Flank Deterrence Line, a layered zone of defenses along NATO\u2019s border.",
      "The commanding general for the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa \u2014 and head of NATO\u2019s Allied Land Command \u2014 Gen. Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",
      "The Merops system has been chosen because it has been used successfully in Ukraine. If something doesn\u2019t work there, it\u2019s \u201cprobably not worthwhile acquiring,\u201d Lowin said.",
      "Drones are evolving rapidly, and each new type demands a different response: The challenge is to identify the threat and then almost immediately work out how to attack it, said Brig. Gen. Zacarias Hernandez, deputy chief of staff plans at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "That requires extremely fast production cycles \u2014 from development to battlefield within weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia is also mass-producing attack drones, equipping them with cameras, jet-propelled engines and advanced anti-jamming antennae.",
      "It, too, has been forced to adapt, as Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged in early October.",
      "Speaking about the military\u2019s initial failures in Ukraine, Putin publicly admitted that \u201cthere were entire fields where our knowledge was simply non-existent\u201d but claimed Russia was now able to field more advanced technology \u201cwithin a matter of days.\u201d",
      "Ukraine, NATO and Russia are in a game of technological cat-and-mouse, the NATO officials suggested.",
      "\u201cWe see what Russia is doing in Ukraine,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cWe have to be ready for that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Deepfakes have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- In 2021, Danish video game live-streamer Marie Watson received an image of herself from an unknown Instagram account.",
      "She instantly recognized the holiday snap from her Instagram account, but something was different: Her clothing had been digitally removed to make her appear naked. It was a deepfake.",
      "\u201cIt overwhelmed me so much,\u201d Watson recalled. \u201cI just started bursting out in tears, because suddenly, I was there naked.\u201d",
      "In the four years since her experience, deepfakes \u2014 highly realistic artificial intelligence-generated images, videos or audio of real people or events \u2014 have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic. That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission. A bill that's expected to pass early next year would change copyright law by imposing a ban on the sharing of deepfakes to protect citizens\u2019 personal characteristics \u2014 such as their appearance or voice \u2014 from being imitated and shared online without their consent.",
      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",
      "He added: \"We can\u2019t just pretend that this is business as usual for how we think about those key parts of our identity and our dignity.\"",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation in May that makes it illegal to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including deepfakes. Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.",
      "Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said that the bill has broad support from lawmakers in Copenhagen, because such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and spread misinformation.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to deepfake a politician without her or him being able to have that product taken down, that will undermine our democracy,\u201d he told reporters during an AI and copyright conference in September.",
      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",
      "Ajder said Google-owned YouTube, for example, has a \u201cvery, very good system for getting the balance between copyright protection and freedom of creativity.\"",

      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as a whole was often at odds with the approach of Pope Francis. His successor, Pope Leo XIV, is continuing a similar pastoral emphasis on marginalized people, poverty and the environment.",
      "Half the 10 candidates on the ballot come from the conservative wing of the conference. The difference is more in style than substance. Most U.S. Catholic bishops are reliably conservative on social issues, but some place more emphasis on opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "\u201cThe slate of 10 candidates perfectly reflects the dynamics of the American hierarchy in that it\u2019s split down the middle,\u201d said David Gibson, director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "There is no clear front-runner. The candidates were nominated by their fellow bishops, and the winner will succeed outgoing leader, Military Services Archbishop Timothy Broglio, for a three-year term. The current vice president, Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, is too close to the mandatory retirement age of 75 to assume the top post.",
      "Among conservatives up for leadership, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley is seen as a strong contender, having already been elected in 2022 to serve as secretary, the No. 3 conference official.",
      "Coakley serves as adviser to the Napa Institute, an association for conservative Catholic powerbrokers. In 2018, he publicly supported an ardent critic of Pope Francis, Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who was later excommunicated for schism.",
      "A well-known name on the ballot is Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota\u2019s Winona-Rochester diocese, whose popular Word on Fire ministry has made him a Catholic media star. He serves on President Donald Trump\u2019s Religious Liberty Commission, along with another candidate, Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana.",
      "Some Catholic insiders are hoping for a leader who could help unify U.S. bishops and work well with the Vatican. They point to contenders like Archbishop Charles Thompson of Indianapolis and Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville, Texas.",
      "As Latinos, Flores and another candidate, Archbishop Nelson Perez of Philadelphia, represent a growing segment of the U.S. Catholic Church. Flores has also been the U.S. bishops\u2019 leader in the Vatican\u2019s synod process to modernize the church.",
      "\u201cCertainly, the two names that get talked about the most are Flores and Coakley,\u201d said Steven Millies, a professor of public theology at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.",

      "A coalition of retired military nurses and others is pushing to award the Congressional Gold Medal to World War II nurses",
      "DANVILLE, Calif. -- At age 106, Alice Darrow can clearly recall her days as a nurse during World War II, part of a pioneering group that dodged bullets as they hauled packs full of medical supplies and treated the burns and gunshot wounds of troops.",
      "Some nurses were killed by enemy fire. Others spent years as prisoners of war. Most returned home to quiet lives, receiving little recognition.",
      "Darrow sat with patients, even after-hours. One of them had arrived at her hospital on California's Mare Island with a bullet lodged in his heart. He was not expected to survive surgery, yet he would change her life.",
      "\u201cTo them, you\u2019re everything because you\u2019re taking care of them,\u201d she said, sitting at her home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Danville.",
      "Eighty years after the war ended, a coalition of retired military nurses and others is campaigning to award one of the nation\u2019s highest civilian honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, to all nurses who served in WWII. Other groups, such as the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII and the real-life Rosie the Riveters, have already received the honor.",
      "\u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t often recognize, I think, the contribution that the nurses have made in pretty much every war,\u201d said Patricia Upah, a retired colonel who served as an Army nurse in conflicts abroad, and whose late mother was also a Army nurse in the South Pacific in World War II.",
      "Only a handful, like Darrow, are still alive. The coalition knows of five World War II nurses who are still living \u2014 including Elsie Chin Yuen Seetoo, 107, who became the first Chinese American nurse to join the Army Nurse Corps. They fear time is running out to honor the trailblazers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time we honor the nurses who stepped up and did their part to defend our freedom,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said in a statement.",
      "Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, have sponsored legislation to award the medal, but it faces steep odds. It needs two-thirds of each chamber \u2014 67 cosponsors in the Senate and 290 in the House \u2014 and so far, the bills have eight and six cosponsors, respectively.",
      "Before the war, there were fewer than 600 nurses with the U.S. Army and 1,700 with the U.S. Navy. By the end of the war, those numbers had ballooned to 59,000 in the Army and 14,000 in the Navy.",
      "The Congressional bills cite harrowing examples of bravery. Some nurses served on Navy hospital ships treating patients as the vessels came under fire. Sixty nurses landed off the coast of North Africa on Nov. 8, 1942, to set up shop and care for invading troops.",
      "\u201cWithout weapons, they waded ashore amid enemy sniper fire and ultimately took shelter in an abandoned civilian hospital,\" the legislation states.",
      "The nurses saved lives. Fewer than 4% of U.S. soldiers in WWII who received medical care in the field or underwent evacuation died from wounds or disease, the legislation states.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw more infections. They probably saw more chemical casualties. Remember, they didn\u2019t have disposable products, so they had to sterilize everything,\u201d says Edward Yackel, a retired colonel and president of the Army Nurse Corps Association, of World War II nurses.",
      "\u201cWithout them,\u201d he says, \u201cwe would not have the knowledge base we need now to fight the wars of today.\u201d",
      "Some nurses endured harsh captivity. In 1942, nearly 80 military nurses were captured when the U.S. surrendered the Philippines to Japan. Held as prisoners of war, the women endured starvation rations and disease but continued to work until their liberation three years later.",

    "story": [
      "Conservation groups are suing over a program that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to help grow the size of a southwest Alaska caribou herd",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Conservation groups sued Monday over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown bears and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd in the southwest part of the state. The groups allege the program lacks a scientific basis and is unconstitutional.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court says the program adopted by the Alaska Board of Game in July doesn\u2019t require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor bear populations to ensure their numbers remain sustainable. It also says the program \u2014 carried out by department employees and allowing them to shoot from helicopters \u2014 sets no limits on how many bears can be killed in an area that's roughly the size of Indiana.",
      "Filed by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, the lawsuit lists as defendants the state, the board, the Department of Fish and Game and the department's commissioner. A message seeking comment was sent to the Alaska Department of Law, which typically represents state agencies in litigation.",
      "Monday's lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing legal fight over what Fish and Game has cast as an effort to restore the Mulchatna caribou herd. The herd, named for its traditional calving ground, peaked in number at around 190,000 in the late 1990s and had provided an important source of food for subsistence hunters from dozens of communities. But the herd's numbers began falling, down to about 13,000 caribou by 2019, and hunting has not been allowed since 2021, according to the department.",
      "The department has said that factors such as disease, hunting, food availability and quality, and predation can affect caribou survival, and in this case, the board determined it could address predation. It said it's responding to requests to help rebuild the herd and restore the caribou as a food source for the region.",
      "In a fall newsletter, the department said bears and wolves \u201chave been identified as significant calf predators.\u201d It said an aerial survey last fall indicated the ratio of calves to cows in the herd's western subgroup was the highest recorded since 1999. It said this suggested a \u201cpositive response\u201d to its 2023 and 2024 predator control program targeting bears and wolves on calving grounds.",
      "According to the lawsuit, in May 2023 the agency killed \u201cevery single brown and black bear it found within the 1,200-square-mile (3,108-square-kilometer) focus area encompassing the western Mulchatna caribou herd calving grounds.\" Altogether, in 2023 and 2024, 180 bears, most brown bears, were killed, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Alaska Wildlife Alliance previously sued to end the program. In that case, a judge in March found fault with the process in which it was adopted and concluded the state lacked data on bear sustainability in the region before implementing the program.",
      "But the board and department pushed ahead, implementing emergency regulations under which 11 bears were killed before those were struck down by another judge.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the government shutdown stretches on, military advocates are warning of long-lasting effects to National Guard troops and their readiness, while the military services are grappling with an inability to fully discharge active duty service members.",
      "\u201cThe shutdown has been uniquely hard on the 433,000 Army and Air National Guardsmen,\u201d Francis McGinn, president of the National Guard Association, told reporters Monday.",
      "The Trump administration has made a public effort of blunting the impact on active duty service members by moving money around to ensure they have received two paychecks since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. But McGinn said more than 30,000 technicians \u2014 full-time civilian government employees who also serve in uniform \u2014 have not been paid since the end of September.",
      "These technicians, National Guard members who typically carry out training for their units or maintain equipment, \u201care critical to our day-to-day operations and generating readiness,\u201d McGinn said.",
      "Adding to the pressures, the Trump administration has sent National Guard troops to patrol the streets of several major U.S. cities, including more than 2,300 deployed to Washington, D.C.",
      "The \u201cdamage\u201d also goes beyond paychecks and into more than a month of canceled school, training and maintenance opportunities that troops will struggle to make up when the government reopens, said John Hashem, executive director of Reserve Organization of America, an advocacy group for Guard and Reserve troops.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018We\u2019ll pick it up next month,\u2019 it\u2019s that we are in turmoil now \u2014 I just can\u2019t throw you back into school if I had to take you out of it. I just can\u2019t get you ready for the next exercise because now, probably, the exercise has been changed entirely,\u201d Hashem said.",
      "McGinn added that \u201cthere\u2019s just thousands and thousands of hours\u201d of vehicle and aircraft maintenance that National Guard troops are going to have to catch up on.",
      "Hashem and McGinn said they also worry about the impact the shutdown will have on morale and retention. McGinn said the technicians especially feel \u201ccompletely demoralized\u201d and \u201cbetrayed by the government.\u201d",
      "At the same time, the military is facing a growing number of active duty troops who need to be discharged but no one to generate the formal documents needed to certify the end of their service.",
      "The Air Force is \u201clegally prohibited from obligating the government for costs associated with some voluntary and administrative separations happening in November,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "Both the Navy and Air Force said they were allowing affected service members to opt in to a temporary extension of their service to wait out the shutdown and ensure they don't experience gaps in pay or benefits.",

After the government reopens, Congress should \"pass a bill that doesn\u2019t allow this to happen again for our military service members, civilians and Americans,\u201d he told reporters Monday.",

He has two weeks to change his mind about choosing which method will be used, Tennessee Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter said in an email.",

Although several states still permit the use of the electric chair, it has only been used five times in the past decade, all in Tennessee.",

It was a process that inmates' attorneys claimed was riddled with problems. Their concerns were shown to have merit in 2022, when Gov. Bill Lee paused executions, including a second execution date for Nichols.

      "GREENBELT, Md. -- U.S. government attorneys say they have cleared all the hurdles needed to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and are asking a federal judge to dissolve an order blocking his deportation.",
      "Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year has helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. His attorneys claim the administration is now manipulating the immigration system in order to punish him for successfully challenging that deportation.",
      "A motion from the government filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland late on Friday says officials have received assurances from Liberia that Abrego Garcia would not face persecution or torture there. Further, it says an immigration officer heard Abrego Garcia's claims that he feared deportation to the West African nation, but ruled against him.",
      "His attorneys argue in a separate Friday filing that Abrego Garcia has already designated Costa Rica as a country where he is willing to be deported. They claim the government now must send him there. The fact that officials continue to pursue deportation to other countries is evidence that the process is retaliatory and violates due process protections, they argue.",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there. But in March, he was deported to El Salvador anyway in what a government attorney later said was an administrative error. Facing pressure from the courts, the administration brought him back to the U.S. in June but has since been pursuing his deportation to a third country.",
      "Much of Abrego Garcia's argument against his deportation to Liberia hinges on due process claims. The government tries to tear down those claims, arguing that his due process rights are not the same as a U.S. citizen's. Because he entered the country illegally, he should be treated the same as someone who just crossed the border, they argue.",

      "As part of his due process rights, his attorneys also say he is entitled to have an immigration judge review the immigration officer's determination that Abrego Garcia is unlikely to be persecuted or tortured in Liberia. They argue the officer should have considered the fact that Liberia could re-deport Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. And they say the Liberian government has only agreed to accept him on a temporary basis.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that \u201cthis highly unusual payment \u2014 to one of the most corrupt governments in the world \u2014 raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would \u201cfar exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined\u201d to the country.",
      "The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.",
      "The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, \u201cImplementing the Trump Administration\u2019s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America\u2019s border security.\u201d",
      "As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.",
      "The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the \u201cthird country\u201d policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro \u201cTeddy\u201d Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.",

Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.",

      "A court in West Virginia is set to hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging the deployment of the state National Guard to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities.",
      "The hearing Monday afternoon is the third in the past three weeks in Charleston over the state's response to Trump's crime-fighting efforts, which have unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.",
      "West Virginia is among several states that sent National Guard members starting in August to the nation's capital. While the state National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November, it is consulting with the governor\u2019s office and others on the possibility of extending the stay. Formal orders were issued last week extending the deployment of the Washington D.C. National Guard in the city through the end of February.",
      "A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says in a lawsuit that Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority by deploying up to 300 Guard members to Washington, D.C.

      "Morrisey\u2019s office has argued the deployment was authorized under federal law.",
      "At an initial hearing last month, the civic group argued that it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from its core mission of government accountability and transparency. The state attorney general\u2019s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey\u2019s decision.",

      "The Trump administration is again asking the Supreme Court to keep full food aid payments on hold",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in a push to keep full payments in the SNAP federal food aid program frozen while the government is shut down, even as some families struggled to put food on the table.",
      "The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now.",
      "The high court is expected to rule Tuesday.",

      "Brandi Johnson, 48, of St. Louis, said she\u2019s struggling to make the $20 she has left in her SNAP account stretch. Johnson said she has been skipping meals the past two weeks to make sure her three teenage children have something to eat. She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.",
      "She said food pantries have offered little help in recent days. Many require patrons to live in a certain ZIP code or are dedicated to helping the elderly first.",
      "\u201cI think about it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, literally,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to figure out how you\u2019re going to eat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration argued that lower court orders requiring the full funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wrongly affect ongoing negotiations in Congress about ending the shutdown. Supreme Court Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the funding lapse tragic, but said judges shouldn't be deciding how to handle it.",
      "The Senate Monday passed a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown and refill SNAP funds. It now goes to the House for consideration.",
      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",
      "Millions more people still have not received SNAP payments for November, because their states were waiting on guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP. Several states have made partial payments, including Texas, where officials said money was going on cards for some beneficiaries Monday.",
      "\u201cContinued delays deepen suffering for children, seniors, and working families, and force nonprofits to shoulder an even heavier burden,\u201d Diane Yentel, President and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. \u201cIf basic decency and humanity don\u2019t compel the administration to assure food security for all Americans, then multiple federal court judges finding its actions unlawful must.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s administration has argued that the judicial order to provide full benefits violates the Constitution by infringing on the spending power of the legislative and executive branches.",
      "Wisconsin, which was among the first to load full benefits after McConnell\u2019s order, had its federal reimbursement frozen. The state\u2019s SNAP account could be depleted as soon as Monday, leaving no money to reimburse stores that sell food to SNAP recipients, according to a court filing.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday, welcoming the once-pariah state into a U.S.-led global coalition to fight the Islamic State group.",
      "Al-Sharaa arrived at the White House around 11:30 a.m. for his Oval Office meeting, which was closed to the press. The Syrian president entered the building through West Executive Avenue, adjacent to the White House, rather than on the West Wing driveway normally used for foreign leaders' arrivals. He left the White House about two hours later and greeted a throng of supporters gathered outside before getting into his motorcade.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that\u2019s part of the Middle East,\u201d Trump told reporters later Monday. The U.S. president said of al-Sharaa that \u201cI have confidence that he\u2019ll be able to do the job.\" Trump said later on his social media site that he plans to meet and speak with the Syrian leader again.",
      "Al-Sharaa, in an interview on Fox News, said he and Trump talked about investment opportunities in Syria in the future, \"so that Syria is no longer looked at as a security threat. It is now looked at as a geopolitical ally. And it\u2019s a place where the United States can have great investments, especially extracting gas.\u201d",
      "Syria formally confirmed that it would join the global coalition against the Islamic State group during al-Sharaa's visit, becoming its 90th member, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hadn\u2019t yet been a formal announcement. The U.S. will also allow Syria to resume operations at its embassy in Washington so the two countries can better coordinate on counterterrorism, security and economic issues, the official said.",
      "Syria\u2019s foreign ministry, in a statement, described the meeting as \u201cfriendly and constructive\u201d and said Trump \u201caffirmed the readiness of the United States to provide the support that the Syrian leadership needs to ensure the success of the reconstruction and development process.\u201d",
      "The ministry said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had then met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Washington on Monday, and that they agreed to proceed with implementing an agreement reached in March between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to integrate the SDF into the new Syrian army. Implementation of the deal has repeatedly stalled amid tensions between the two sides. It was unclear what concrete steps were agreed upon in Monday\u2019s meeting.",
      "The statement said the \u201cAmerican side also affirmed its support for reaching a security agreement with Israel,\u201d but it did not say how Syria had responded.",
      "Al-Sharaa's visit was the first to the White House by a Syrian head of state since the Middle Eastern country gained independence from France in 1946 and comes after the U.S. lifted sanctions imposed on Syria during the decades the country was ruled by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country\u2019s interim leader in January.",
      "Trump and al-Sharaa \u2014 who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head \u2014 first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.",
      "Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.",

He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad\u2019s government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Kirkland, a onetime model who turned to acting and was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna,\" has died, her representative confirmed to the Associated Press. She was 84.",
      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",
      "Kirkland volunteered for people who had AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for inmates, especially young people.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:07:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, writer and musician has been an unconventional and unforgettable presence, from his Oscar-winning \"Sling Blade,\" to his rock band, The Boxmasters. He's now back in Season 2 of the Paramount+ series \"Landman,\" set in the oil fields of West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",
      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it. And I felt like there was no place for that. And I think that's when it imploded in on me, and when I got sick and lost myself, you know?\"",
      "\"How did your deal with it?\"",
      "\"I got help,\" she replied. \"I got therapy. Singing. I mean, I honestly think it's kind of saved me. Something wasn't alive then, let's just say, like it is now.\"",

      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation.

    "summary": "The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class included Warren Zevon, Bad Company, Salt-N-Pepa, Outkast, Soundgarden, Cyndi Lauper and The White Stripes.",
    "story": [
      "Salt-N-Pepa threw on the multicolored leather jackets from their \"Push It\" video and brought the crowd at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony to its feet with a romping rendition of their 1987 breakthrough hit.",
      "\"This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn't,\" Cheryl \"Salt\" James said Saturday while accepting the musical influence award that made her, Sandra \"Pepa\" Denton and DJ Spinderella members of the hall.",
      "In a rousing speech at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, James brought up their fight to reclaim their master recordings from Universal Music Group.",
      "\"The industry still doesn't want to play fair, Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,\" James said.",
      "They took the stage for a medley of their hits. They opened with \"Shoop\" then slid into \"Let's Talk About Sex\" before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit \"What a Man.\" \"Push It\" pushed the energy up another notch.",
      "Spinderella became the first female DJ to enter the hall.",
      "\"The female rappers had to step to the mic and show that they could go toe to toe with the guys. And Salt, Pepa and Spinderella did it,\" Missy Elliott said while inducting the trio.",
      "Chappell Roan was set to induct Cyndi Lauper.",
      "Outkast don't perform, but appear together",
      "Outkast didn't perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first.",
      "Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech \u2014 \"I'm freestylin' y'all!\" \u2014 that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement \"dungeon\" in Atlanta in the early 1990s.",
      "He choked out the words, \"Great things start in little rooms.\"",
      "Andre sat out the performance but Big Boi, wearing shorts and a fur coat, started off an express tour through the Atlanta duo's discography that included Tyler the Creator, JID and Killer Mike.",
      "Janelle Mon\u00e1e joined them to shake her way through \"Hey Ya\" and Doja Cat delivered a sly and soulful take on \"Ms. Jackson.\"",
      "In his speech inducting them, Donald Glover praised them as \"two visionaries who turned their differences into a dynasty.\"",
      "An emotional Jim Carrey remembers Chris Cornell while inducting Soundgarden",
      "Emotions ran deep during Soundgarden's segment of the night, starting with the induction speech of Jim Carrey, the actor and Soundgarden super-fan who seemed to be fighting off tears throughout as he talked about Cornell, who died from suicide in 2017.",
      "\"When you looked into his eyes, it's like eternity was staring back,\" Carrey said. \"For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.\"",
      "Each of his bandmates, all major godfathers of the Seattle grunge scene, paid their own tearful tributes.",
      "One of Cornell's daughters, Lilian, spoke for him while another, Toni, sang a quiet rendition of his song \"Fell on Black Days.\"",
      "\"I am just really really happy that he got to make music with his friends,\" Lilian Cornell said.",
      "Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell's mighty wail, backed by his bandmates on \"Rusty Cage\" and \"Black Hole Sun.\"",
      "Bassist Hiro Yamamoto was among the few who brought up the politics of the moment from the stage.",
      "\"Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,\" Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. \"Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. Let's not add another story like this to our history.\"",
      "Meg White not in attendance for induction of The White Stripes",
      "The White Stripes reunion that some fans had hoped for didn't happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo's stadium-shaking anthem \"Seven Nation Army\" and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist doing a mid-audience acoustic version of \"We're Gonna Be Friends.\"",
      "Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of \"Seven Nation Army\" then remembered his thoughts on meeting them.",
      "\"Cute kids, they're gonna go places,\" Pop said. \"And they did.\"",
      "Drummer Meg White, who has led an almost entirely private life since the band broke up in 2011, did not show up for the ceremony, but Jack White said Meg, his ex-wife, helped him write the speech he delivered while wearing the band's signature red and white.",
      "Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is \"the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.\"",
      "He nearly cried several times as he told an Adam-and-Eve-like tale of \"the boy and the girl\" who made magic together, \"knowing that they have shared and made another person feel something.\"",
      "Stevie Wonder pays tribute to Sly Stone",
      "Stevie Wonder led a funky and flashy tribute to the late Sly Stone to open the show that's streaming live on Disney+, will be available on Hulu Sunday and will air in an edited version on ABC on Jan 1.",
      "Wonder was joined Saturday night by Questlove, Leon Thomas, Maxwell, Beck, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers for rousing renditions of Sly and the Family Stone hits \"Dance to the Music,\" \"Everyday People\" and \"Thank You.\" Jennifer Hudson joined them to wail through \"Higher.\"",
      "Stone, who was inducted into the hall in 1993, died in June. Brian Wilson, who died two days later, will also get a tribute from Elton John.",
      "Mick Fleetwood opens ceremony, inducts Bad Company",
      "Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac began the ceremony proper by inducting Bad Company. He called the British group founded by Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs in 1973 \"classic rock legends\" and \"one of the first super groups,\" but said that, more importantly, \"they were four great musicians who came together for the love of music.\"",
      "Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member who took the stage.",
      "He was joined by an ad hoc super group that blasted through a few of the super group's biggest hits.",
      "Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson took lead vocals on their hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" with Nancy Wilson of Heart and Joe Perry of Aerosmith on guitars. Bryan Adams took the stage to sing \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "\"I've never played in a tuxedo before\" said Kirke as he accepted the honor for the group.",
      "He got emotional as he thanked Ralphs' wife Susie for taking care of him.",
      "David Letterman inducts the late Warren Zevon",
      "The late singer-songwriter Warren Zevon was inducted by David Letterman, a friend and superfan who made Zevon a regular on his NBC late-night show.",
      "\"Warren Zevon is in my Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,\" Letterman said. \"Actually his own wing.\"",
      "A clip was shown from Zevon's final appearance on the show in 2002, when he was dying of cancer. \"Enjoy every sandwich,\" Zevon said when Letterman asked what he'd learned about mortality.",
      "Letterman was tearful as he showed the crowd a guitar that Zevon gave him later that night.",
      "\"He's never going away,\" Bruce Springsteen said in a recorded tribute. \"He's got a body of work that's as good as anybody's.\"",
      "Letterman outlined several categories of Zevon's cleverly emotional tunes, the final one being \"songs about werewolves\" to a big laugh from the crowd. 1978's \"Werewolves of London\" was Zevon's biggest, and most unlikely, hit.",
      "The Killers then played Zevon's second-biggest hit, \"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

      "The nominations include some historical firsts. For Lamar, \"GNX\" is his fifth consecutive studio album to be nominated for album of the year, something no other artist has ever done. It's the first time Lady Gaga has been nominated for song, record and album of the year simultaneously. Bad Bunny also became the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for song, record and album of the year in the same year, according to Variety.",

    "story": [
      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

      "Carrie + Bryan",
      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:22:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-50-year-mortgage-loan-bill-pulte-cost/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:25:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable? The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan.",
      "Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "The proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News interview on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

      "An outbreak of botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula has made at least 15 infants sick in 12 states, a California health official said Monday. The company announced Tuesday that it is expanding its voluntary recall to include all products while the investigation continues.",
      "Nine cases of infant botulism type A have been confirmed, with results on six others pending, said Dr. Erica Pan, health officer for the California Department of Public Health. That's an increase from 13 cases in 10 states reported on Saturday.",
      "Federal and state officials are investigating the outbreak, which began in mid-August. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart, a maker of organic baby formula based in New York, initially recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula over the weekend. It has now expanded that recall to include all batches of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Packs nationwide.",
      "\"The safety and well\u2011being of every infant who uses our formula is, and always will be, our highest priority,\" Mia Funt, co\u2011founder and president of ByHeart, said in a statement. \"This nationwide recall reflects our commitment to protecting babies and giving families clear, actionable information. Alongside this recall, we are conducting a comprehensive investigation to do our part to get the answers parents expect and deserve.\"",
      "\"Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,\" California officials said.",

      "The outbreak has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. The infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\"These mice got sick really quickly,\" Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula. \"Testing unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula. The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",
      "Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\"This would be extremely rare,\" he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott's recall involved top-selling brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.",
      "The effort, dubbed \"Operation Stork Speed,\" is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.",

    "summary": "Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are expected to be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from last year's average.",
    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to fewer turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

      "It's still unclear when the shutdown might end, though the Senate is working to finalize a funding package. House members were told late Sunday to expect votes on government funding this week, pending final passage of the funding measure in the Senate.",

The law covers both furloughed employees and those required to work without pay, requiring agencies to issue retroactive payments as soon as possible rather than waiting for scheduled pay dates.",
      "As the shutdown stretches on, the financial toll on federal workers has deepened, with some turning to\u00a0bank loans to cover bills. About 1.4 million employees\u00a0missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

In his new eight-page message, Buffett reminisced about his childhood in Omaha, Nebraska, the people who shaped his career, and the values that guided him, while noting that his health remains good.",
      "\"To my surprise, I generally feel good,\" he wrote. \"Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.\"",

      "More than 2.7 million shares will go to four family foundations, with 1.5 million shares given to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 400,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation, Berkshire Hathaway announced on Monday.",
      "Berkshire Hathaway's new CEO",

Abel, who serves as vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors and oversees non-insurance operations at the company, will step in as CEO and chairman at the start of 2026.",
      "Buffett took majority control of the company in 1965, transforming it from a textile manufacturer into one of the world's leading investment operations. Berkshire Hathaway now ranks as the 9th largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization, behind tech giants like NVIDIA and Amazon.",
      "The company's success has catapulted Buffett into the ranks of the world's richest people, giving him a net worth of more than $150 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his latest letter, Buffett reiterated his belief in Abel as his successor. \"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "Buffett added he plans to continue writing an annual Thanksgiving message to his children and shareholders.",
      "\"Berkshire's individual shareholders are a\u00a0very\u00a0special group who are unusually generous in sharing their gains with others less fortunate. I enjoy the chance to keep in touch with you,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "summary": "Fox Sports\u200b announced that it has hired former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to replace Mark Sanchez.",
    "story": [
      "Former NFL quarterback and TV analyst Mark Sanchez has been let go by Fox Sports a month after he was stabbed during a fight in Indianapolis.",
      "\"We can confirm that Mark Sanchez is no longer with the network,\" a Fox Sports spokesman told CBS News on Friday. \"There will be no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Sanchez, 38, has been off the air since police said he was stabbed during a fight with a truck driver outside an Indianapolis hotel on Oct. 4. The former quarterback was in Indianapolis for Fox's coverage of the Oct. 5 game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Sanchez faces a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanors, for what prosecutors have said was a fight over parking. If convicted, he could face a sentence of between one to six years in prison.",
      "Sanchez and Fox Sports also face a civil lawsuit filed by the driver, 69-year-old Perry Tole.",
      "Nick Sanchez Jr., on behalf of the Sanchez family, provided a statement to CBS News on Friday, saying: \"It's been a long month for Mark as he continues to recover from serious injuries while also grieving the loss of a close friend. While the recent news \u2014 and its timing \u2014 is understandably disappointing, our priority remains his continued healing and recovery.\"",
      "He continued: \"Mark deeply values his time at FOX and the exceptional colleagues he's had the privilege to work with. Those relationships are meaningful and will endure.\"",
      "Fox Sports announced Friday that it has hired former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to replace Sanchez as its No. 4 NFL crew. He will also team up with play-by-play announcer Adam Amin and sideline reporter Kristina Pink. Brees' first game will be Nov. 16.",
      "Brees retired from the NFL following the 2020 season after a 20-year career with the San Diego Chargers and New Orleans, including leading the Saints to their only Super Bowl title during the 2009 season.",
      "He joined NBC in 2021 as an analyst for Notre Dame college football games and was in the studio most Sundays for \"Football Night in America.\" Brees called a wild-card game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals but noticeably struggled. NBC and Brees parted ways a couple of months later.",
      "Brees made a studio appearance during \"Fox NFL Sunday\" earlier this season and is slated to be an analyst for one of Netflix's two Christmas Day games.",
      "\"Drew is one of the best to ever play the game, and we couldn't be more excited to have his prolific credentials and unique insights as part of our coverage on Sundays,\" said Brad Zager, Fox Sports president of production & operations and executive producer. \"We're thrilled to welcome him to the Fox Sports family.\"",
      "Brees added in a statement that he appreciated the opportunity to join Fox and that \"I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insights I provide to the fans each Sunday.\"",
      "In his first year of eligibility, Brees is among the list of 52 modern-era players being considered for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Brees remains second all-time in league history in passing yards (80,358) and passing touchdowns (571).",
      "While Brees takes over, Sanchez's legal issues will go on.",
      "An Indianapolis judge scheduled his trial to begin on Dec. 11.",
      "A police affidavit alleges that Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis on Oct. 4. Tole claims in his lawsuit that Sanchez entered the truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray.",
      "When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.",
      "Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.",
      "Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.",
      "He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.",

    "summary": "Workers looking to pick up extra cash working retail jobs this winter may be out of luck as stores pull back on hiring.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "A 208-year-old publication that farmers, gardeners and others keen to predict the weather have relied on for guidance has published for the final time.",
      "Farmers' Almanac said Thursday that its 2026 edition, which is already available, will be its last, citing the growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the book in today's \"chaotic media environment.\" Access to the online version will cease next month.",
      "The Maine-based publication, not to be confused with the even older Old Farmer's Almanac in neighboring New Hampshire, was first printed in 1818. For centuries, it's used a secret formula based on sunspots, planetary positions and lunar cycles to generate long-range weather forecasts.",
      "The almanac also contains gardening tips, trivia, jokes and natural remedies, like catnip as a pain reliever or elderberry syrup as an immune booster. But its weather forecasts make the most headlines.",
      "A goodbye piece titled \"A Fond Farewell\" says, \"The season we hoped would never come is here.\"",
      "In the piece, Editor Sandi Duncan and Editor Emeritus Peter Geiger say, \"We are incredibly proud of the legacy we leave behind and are filled with gratitude. We appreciate and thank our loyal readers, contributors, and partners who have supported us through the years. Though the Almanac will no longer be available in print or online, it lives on within you.\"",
      "Separately, Duncan wrote,\u00a0\"It is with a heavy heart that we share the end of what has not only been an annual tradition in millions of homes and hearths for hundreds of years, but also a way of life, an inspiration for many who realize the wisdom of generations past is the key to the generations of the future.\"",
      "In 2017, when Farmers' Almanac reported a circulation of 2.1 million in North America, its editor said it was gaining new readers among people interested in where their food came from and who were growing fresh produce in home gardens.",
      "Many of these readers lived in cities, prompting the publication to feature skyscrapers as well as an old farmhouse on it final cover.",

    "story": [
      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",
      "Fifteen of those airports are included on the\u00a0list obtained by CBS News of airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "The FAA has issued at least 125 ground delays or stops due to staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, compared with 26 in September, according to a CBS News analysis of Air Traffic Control System Command Center Advisories. That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",

      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "summary": "The FAA will reduce U.S. air traffic by 10% at 40 U.S. locations starting on Friday due to the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that it will update its schedule once the flight reductions begin so the carrier can notify customers of any changes \"several days\" in advance.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",
      "In a press release Wednesday, the FDA said patients should only receive the drugs from health professionals who are licensed and trained to administer them. Patients experiencing signs of botulism should \"seek immediate medical care,\" the agency noted.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake city.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, speading out making Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "A legal watchdog group is pushing the state bars of Florida and Virginia to investigate Lindsey Halligan, a Trump appointee who is leading the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "The complaint from the Campaign for Accountability, which was submitted to the state bars on Tuesday, accuses Halligan of violating the Virginia State Bar's ethical rules for lawyers in her handling of the criminal charges against Comey and James, two longtime foes of President Trump.",
      "\"Ms. Halligan's actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,\" the 17-page complaint reads.",
      "Comey was indicted in Virginia in September for allegedly lying to Congress, just days after Mr. Trump named Halligan \u2014 his former personal lawyer \u2014 as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Two weeks later, Halligan's office also secured an indictment against James for alleged bank fraud. Both Comey and James pleaded not guilty. Mr. Trump has lashed out against Comey and James for years, and publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into both of them in September.",
      "By seeking those indictments, the Campaign for Accountability alleges that Halligan violated the Virginia State Bar's rules banning lawyers from making false statements to a court and barring prosecutors from filing charges that aren't supported by probable cause.",
      "She's also accused of breaking rules that require lawyers to provide \"competent representation\" to clients, avoid making certain out-of-court statements and avoid any \"deliberately wrongful act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness to practice law.\"",
      "The complaint noted several portions of the Comey and James indictments that critics have pointed to as possible weaknesses.",
      "In particular, Comey was charged with lying to the Senate in 2020 when asked whether he'd authorized any FBI staffers to serve as anonymous sources in news reports about Hillary Clinton, but the staffer he was asked about during the Senate hearing is different from the one who was referenced in the indictment.",
      "And James was accused of falsely stating on mortgage forms that a house she bought in Virginia would be her second home, when it was actually used as a rental property. But the Campaign for Accountability argues the form cited in the indictment didn't actually bar the house from being rented out.",
      "The complaint also points to reports that other prosecutors and investigators were wary of charging Comey and James, including Erik Siebert, who led the Justice Department's outpost in the Eastern District of Virginia until he resigned under pressure and was replaced by Halligan.",
      "\"The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump's intervention, neither Mr. Comey nor Ms. James would have been indicted,\" the complaint says.",
      "It continues: \"Ms. Halligan was well aware President Trump had installed her as Interim U.S. Attorney specifically to indict Mr. Comey and Ms. James and, within just a few days of joining the office, she did just that\u2014despite career officials having found the cases insupportable.\"",
      "The complaint also castigates Halligan for an alleged conversation that she had with legal journalist Anna Bower about the James case. Bower says that after she shared a New York Times article about the case, Halligan messaged her on the encrypted app Signal and accused her of \"jumping to conclusions\" and sharing \"biased\" information that was \"way off.\"",
      "This conversation, the Campaign for Accountability argues, may have run afoul of rules that ban lawyers from speaking out of court in a way that could hurt the fairness of a jury trial.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Halligan for comment.",
      "The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "The complaint asks the Virginia State Bar and the Florida Bar to launch investigations into Halligan and, if warranted, impose disciplinary consequences.",
      "It could be a while before the issue is resolved. The two states have different processes for reviewing bar complaints against lawyers, but in both cases, there are several layers of review by attorneys and committees before a lawyer would face discipline \u2014 which can range from a reprimand to suspension or loss of their law license. Both state bars say they receive thousands of complaints annually, most of which don't result in discipline.",
      "Other high-profile complaints against lawyers, including the ones that led to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's disbarment in New York and D.C., have taken years to reach a formal conclusion.",
      "Halligan is the latest Trump-linked lawyer to come into the Campaign for Accountability's sights. The group has also filed bar complaints against Alina Habba and John Sarcone, the top federal prosecutors in New Jersey and the Northern District of New York, respectively. Both prosecutors were named to their roles on an interim basis, and have faced challenges to their appointments.",
      "Meanwhile, attorneys for both Comey and James have questioned Halligan's role in their clients' prosecutions. They argue Halligan was invalidly appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney, and say the charges against the two Trump adversaries were driven by personal animus.",
      "And a magistrate judge accused the Justice Department of taking an \"indict first, investigate second\" approach to the Comey case last week.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Halligan.",
      "\"Our EDVA US Attorney Lindsey Halligan did an outstanding job,\" Bondi wrote on X shortly after Comey was charged. \"We will continue to fight for accountability, fairness, and the rule of law because the American people deserve nothing less.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Monday to review a New York civil jury's 2023 conclusion that he was liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial of the federal case, calling Carroll's claims \"implausible\" and arguing testimony stretched \"credulity past the breaking point.\" He has since promised to challenge the case all the way to the nation's highest court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Mr. Trump's appeal in December 2024, and in June rejected a request for an en banc review, in which all the judges on the court consider the case.",
      "The Supreme Court is now his last hope of overturning the jury's unanimous verdict. The jury found that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Mr. Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store, sticking his fingers into her vagina.",
      "The jury rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, though the trial judge, Lewis Kaplan, later wrote that the conclusion that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll by forcefully inserting his fingers was an \"implicit determination that Mr. Trump digitally raped her.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claims Kaplan \"erred\" in several evidentiary rulings that affected Mr. Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "His appeal calls Carroll's claims \"facially implausible, politically motivated allegations.\"",
      "A spokesman for his legal team tied the case to others pursued against Mr. Trump during the years between his presidencies.",
      "\"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,\" the spokesman said. \"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again.\"",
      "An attorney for Carroll did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Carroll's legal team received some of its funding from a nonprofit tied to a Democratic megadonor, but has said in legal filings Carroll was not involved in obtaining the outside funds, which they received nearly a year after she filed her first lawsuit. They've said the funding was irrelevant to her sexual abuse and defamation claims.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations since they first surfaced in 2019, when she went public with a book excerpt published in New York Magazine.",
      "He has also appealed a separate federal jury verdict in January 2024 that found him liable for making further defamatory statements\u00a0 against Carroll. Combined, the two juries awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",

    "summary": "Trump has threatened to sue Britain's national broadcaster BBC for $1 billion, claiming defamation over a program on his remarks on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The outgoing director of the BBC addressed staff of the publicly-funded British national broadcaster in a call on Tuesday admitting mistakes were made but urging them to \"fight for our journalism\" after President Trump threatened to sue the corporation for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are in a unique and precious organization, and I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponization. I think we've got to fight for our journalism,\" Tim Davie said in the Tuesday call.",
      "Davie gave three main reasons for his decision to step down from his role, including the demanding nature of the job and the upcoming BBC Charter renewal process that will take place in the U.K.",
      "He also said: \"I think we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach and some responsibility had to be taken. So putting that together, that's what made my decision.\"",
      "There was no direct mention of Mr. Trump's threat of legal action, but Davie said political pressures on the BBC from both the U.K. and abroad were \"challenging.\"",
      "In a letter to the BBC's legal team dated November 9, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the October 28, 2024 episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, called \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of a speech made by Mr. Trump on Jan. 6.",
      "The letter claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law.",
      "It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC said Monday that it would \"review the letter and respond in due course.\"",
      "U.K. media lawyer Mark Stephens said it would be hard for Mr. Trump to sue the BBC in the United States.",
      "\"Panorama wasn't broadcast in the USA, and BBC iPlayer (the BBC's streaming platform) isn't available \u2026 so it's not clear that any U.S. court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim,\" Stephens said on the BBC's breakfast program.",
      "The Director General of the BBC, Tim Davie, and its CEO of news, Debora Turness, resigned Sunday amid criticism of the program.",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said in a letter to staff.",
      "Turness said the controversy around the Panorama episode about Mr. Trump had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "Pressure on the top BBC executives mounted after Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper published a leaked memo compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. Among other things, the memo was critical of the editing of the Panorama episode.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 06:14:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Utah judge rejected a new congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers and adopted an alternate proposal creating a Democrat-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 A Utah judge on Monday rejected a new congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers, adopting an alternate proposal creating a Democrat-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Republicans hold all four of Utah's U.S. House seats and had advanced a map poised to protect them.",
      "Judge Dianna Gibson ruled just before a midnight deadline that the Legislature's new map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "She had ordered lawmakers to draw a map that complies with standards established by voters to ensure districts don't deliberately favor a party, a practice known as gerrymandering. If they failed, Gibson warned she may consider other maps submitted by plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led her to throw out Utah's existing map.",
      "Gibson ultimately selected a map drawn by plaintiffs, the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government. It keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was the case previously.",
      "The judge's ruling throws a curveball to Republicans in a state where they expected a clean sweep as they're working to add winnable seats elsewhere. Nationally, Democrats need to net three U.S. House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which is trying to buck a historic pattern of the president's party losing seats in the midterms.",
      "The newly approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that has not had a Democrat in Congress since early 2021.",
      "\"This is a win for every Utahn,\" said state House and Senate Democrats in a joint statement. \"We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.\"",
      "In August, Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.",
      "The ruling thrust Utah into a national redistricting battle as President Trump urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026. Some Democratic states are considering new maps of their own, with California voters approving a map last week that gives Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. Republicans are still ahead in the redistricting fight.",
      "Redistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states - more led by Democrats than Republicans - set their own limitations. The Utah ruling gives an unexpected boost to Democrats, who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.",
      "If Gibson had instead approved the map drawn by lawmakers, all four districts would still lean Republican but two would have become slightly competitive for Democrats. Their proposal gambled on Republicans' ability to protect all four seats under much slimmer margins rather than creating a single-left leaning district.",
      "The ruling came minutes before midnight on the day the state's top election official said was the latest possible date to enact a new congressional map so county clerks would have enough time to prepare for candidate filings for the 2026 midterms.",
      "Republicans have argued Gibson doesn't have legal authority to enact a map that wasn't approved by the Legislature. State Rep. Matt MacPherson called the ruling a \"gross abuse of power\" and said he has opened a bill to pursue impeachment against Gibson.",
      "Gibson said in her ruling she has an obligation to ensure a lawful map is in place by the deadline.",
      "CBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports that Republicans have been holding meetings across Utah to push a ballot initiative to repeal Proposition 4, the law that created the state's Independent Redistricting Commission. Supporters of the repeal effort need to collect about 140,000 signatures to get the measure on the 2026 ballot, giving voters the final say on whether to keep or scrap the commission.",
      "Even if the Utah GOP is successful, Judge Gibson's ruling dictates Utah's congressional districts for the 2026 election cycle.",

    "summary": "Use of force by federal agents has become a focus of legal disputes as the Trump administration contends the tactics are necessary. Our visual investigation breaks down some of the key moments.",
    "story": [
      "You've seen the videos in newscasts and social feeds: Federal agents employing chokeholds, firing pepper spray at close range, and even using vehicle maneuvers to control immigration protests.",
      "These videos have spurred debate over whether agents have violated federal policies on use of force, which is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "A review of hundreds of videos, most recorded on cellphones by protesters and posted online, shows repeated instances that don't appear to meet that standard.",
      "We asked Eric Balliet, a career federal agent who worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than two decades, to review some of the tactics used in these videos. Balliet led internal investigations into use of force misconduct for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until last year.",
      "\"This isn't policing and law enforcement as I practiced it for 25 years,\" he said.",
      "Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino, who is leading the federal agents responding to protests in Chicago, disagrees.",
      "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,\" Bovino said in an interview with CBS News. \"Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Protesters and media organizations in Chicago have filed a complaint in federal court about the tactics employed under Bovino's command, as well as those captured on video recordings in Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles and other cities. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order blocking federal agents from deploying chemical spray, tear gas or any other less-lethal weapon \"unless such force is necessary to stop the immediate threat of physical harm to another.\" The Trump administration has filed an appeal.",
      "DHS is now racing to file its implementation guidance in response to the judge's order. Revised directives informing DHS personnel of banned use-of-force tactics must be issued by the end of the day Tuesday.",
      "\"I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,\" Ellis said in her ruling from the bench.",
      "\"The use of force shocks the conscience,\" Ellis said.",
      "But President Trump said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month that the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"haven't gone far enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know where the leadership is here,\" said Balliet. \"It seems to be non-existent. Any oversight and justification for the use of force seems to be absent across the board.\"",
      "Balliet reviewed dozens of videos at the request of CBS News, and he identified several clear areas of concern with the tactics he saw in use against demonstrators.",
      "Firing less-than-lethal munitions at protesters' heads and torsos",
      "Videos taken outside the ICE facilities show federal agents standing several stories above protesters and shooting less-than-lethal munitions towards their heads and torsos.",
      "One cellphone video from September, taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, shows a priest looking up toward agents standing several stories above him. In the video, agents fire pepper balls that land nearby him, and explode on the ground. One agent then fires a pepper ball that strikes the man in the head, and he crumbles to the ground.",
      "Agency policy prohibits agents from firing at anyone above the waist, stating they \"shall not intentionally target the head, neck, groin, or female breast.\"",
      "Balliet says such incidents show a lack of proper training.",
      "\"They are elevating the force to a degree that is excessive,\" Balliet said.",
      "During an interview, CBS News showed Bovino the September video and asked him if the agent had breached department policy. He said the agent had not \u2014 because the protesters were \"trespassing\" on federal grounds and the use of pepper balls didn't deviate from policy.",
      "\"The use of that less-lethal device, a pepper ball, was absolutely in line with policy. And I applaud them for protecting that federal facility there.\" He said use of force outside of the Broadview facility has been \"exemplary.\"",
      "Tear gas and pepper spray at close range",
      "Videos collected from Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles show agents deploying large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, sometimes at close range.",
      "In one October cellphone video from Portland, a federal agent can be seen spraying a form of tear gas called \"oleoresin capsicum\" spray directly at an individual protester at close range and in high volume.",
      "The protester can be seen verbally confronting two agents in the street. Another agent then walks up to the protester and sprays her directly in the face with a large can of pepper spray.",
      "\"If you take direct shots to the eye, it can scratch or prick your cornea,\" said Balliet. In his experience, agents have gone to the emergency room for eye damage after being sprayed at similar ranges with this type of munition.",
      "DHS policy allows the deployment of chemical irritants only in cases when subjects offer \"active resistance.\" The footage shows protesters yelling but not physically threatening the agents, which Balliet said was not a sufficient provocation for this level of response.",
      "\"For this particular one, it's a little disturbing because there does not appear to be any sort of de-escalation attempt,\" Balliet said.",
      "Vehicle maneuvers used as deadly force",
      "Cellphone videos have also caught federal agents in several cities using vehicles to push or move\u00a0 demonstrators.",
      "In one video from Chicago, an agent in an unmarked federal vehicle slowly drives into a protester. The agent can be heard yelling, \"I'm gonna slam you on the f****** ground,\" as the vehicle makes contact with the demonstrator.",
      "Balliet says driving a vehicle into a protester constitutes \"deadly force,\" or what the DHS use of force policy defines as \"action that carries a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"",
      "\"Anytime you introduce a vehicle into an already volatile situation, it drastically changes the dynamics,\" Balliet said. \"It rises into that deadly force arena.\"",
      "The fact that the vehicle was unmarked and the lack of communication created further risk, he said. A protester in the video can be heard saying, \"Who are you?\" as the car continues to push into the demonstrator.",
      "\"I can't stress enough the significance of markings,\" Balliet said. \"When you blur the line in that world, it presents a danger to everyone involved.\"",
      "Prohibited chokeholds and hand-on contact",
      "Videos received by CBS News reveal agents using aggressive hands-on tactics, including chokeholds, which DHS policy forbids unless the \"deadly force\" is authorized.",
      "\"Chokeholds and carotid restraints must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest,\" states a 2023 DHS Use of Force policy.",
      "But in two videos from Chicago, federal agents are seen putting their hands or arms directly around the necks of protesters during tense encounters. In one Broadview incident, agents surround a female protester who is attempting to block a car from leaving the facility. An agent, who is masked but not wearing a helmet, even as other agents fire pepperballs from an elevated location, puts his arm around her throat. Another officer then pulls the man off the woman and she is released.",
      "\"It's considered lethal force for a reason,\" Balliet said. \"If I were the commander, that individual would be off the team 30 seconds after it happened.\"",
      "In another Chicago video, a Border Patrol agent places his hands around the neck of a protester and slams him onto the ground. As the agent engages in the hands-on approach, he swings his rifle behind him, leaving the muzzle of his potentially loaded gun unprotected.",
      "\"The fact that that weapon, that M4, is just flailing around muzzling the agents, muzzling the crowd, is basically begging some bad actor to grab it,\" said Balliet. \"It's good that somebody didn't get extremely hurt or killed in this.\"",
      "Agents commended by commander, despite alleged violations of DHS policy",
      "Bovino confirmed no one has been disciplined in Chicago in connection to incidents documented during Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Bovino said when asked if anyone acted outside policy.",
      "But Balliet said he believes the lack of accountability could have long-term negative consequences for federal law enforcement.",
      "\"This is gonna have an irreparable harm to the trust and faith that the general public has in its law enforcement officers,\" he said. \"It is creating a divide that is going to take years \u2014 if it can ever be fully repaired.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal agents are \"trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The agency argued that protesters have \"thrown rocks, bottles, and fireworks\" at agents, \"slashed the tires of their vehicles, rammed them, ambushed them, and \u2026destroyed multiple law enforcement vehicles.\"",
      "\"Despite these real dangers, our law enforcement shows incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated,\" the agency statement said.",

    "summary": "The Senate deal to end the government shutdown would extend funding through January and promise Democrats a vote on health care.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate took a major\u00a0step toward ending the government shutdown late Monday by passing a funding bill that unlocks a broader agreement on long-term spending and the promise of a future vote on extending health care tax credits.",
      "The vote was 60-40, with eight Democrats providing the votes needed. One Republican voted against it.",
      "The eight Democrats had been engaged in bipartisan talks over ending the stalemate for several weeks, and reached the agreement without the support of the party's leaders in the upper chamber. The House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday, and if it passes, it will go to President Trump's desk.",
      "The agreement they struck does nothing to address the expiring health care tax credits \u2014 which had been their party's key demand \u2014 besides the promise of a future vote on the issue. The deal left many Democrats furious with the eight senators who voted to advance it and with the party's leaders for allowing the defections.",
      "Here's what is in the agreement:",
      "Government funding extension until Jan. 30",
      "The final deal will include a 31-page continuing resolution that extends current levels of government funding through January 2026 to give lawmakers more time to finalize full-year spending bills.",
      "The House passed a continuing resolution to extend funding until Nov. 21 in September, but until Sunday the Senate was unable to advance it. With that deadline less than two weeks away, Senate negotiators determined that they would need another extension to continue work on appropriations.",
      "Some senators had floated a December deadline in a new continuing resolution, but House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed that possibility, since it would pressure lawmakers to approve new spending before the holidays.",
      "A future vote on health care tax credits",
      "As part of the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which help millions of Americans purchase health insurance on state exchanges. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and patients are facing eye-popping increases for their insurance premiums.",
      "Under the deal, a vote would be held by the end of the second week of December, and the Democrats would have final say on what is in the bill.",
      "But a Senate vote on the issue is likely to fail, since most GOP senators are opposed to the Affordable Care Act overall and the tax credits in particular.",
      "That fact explains why so many Democrats are angry over the agreement, since it does not include an extension of the credits and only promises a future vote. That offer has also been on the table for weeks.",
      "\"There's no way to defend this,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a video on X. \"And you are right to be angry about it. I'm angry about it.\"",
      "Last Friday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the credits. Republicans swiftly rejected Schumer's pitch, and spent Saturday railing against the ACA in speeches on the Senate floor.",
      "A \"minibus\" of 3 appropriations bills",
      "The deal includes three yearlong funding bills that lawmakers have been working on for months. The three bills include funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "The bills have been dubbed a \"minibus\" \u2014 a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation that lawmakers often adopt before the end of the year. Republicans in both chambers have emphasized their desire to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, instead of through a large end-of-year package.",
      "The minibus includes funding for the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026. Because of that, the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to reach a funding deal in other areas by the end of January.",
      "Notably, it would restore full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which faced funding shortfalls due to the shutdown.",
      "A reversal of shutdown layoffs and restrictions on future cuts",
      "The new continuing resolution includes language that reverses the layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the government shutdown, and prevents any cuts until the end of January.",
      "The resolution states that \"any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an Executive Agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.\" A reduction in force, or RIF, is the government's term for layoffs.",
      "The resolution also says that \"no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the Federal Government\" until Jan. 30.",
      "The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal employees during the early stages of the shutdown, an effort that was blocked by a federal judge.",
      "The continuing resolution says that \"Any employee who received notice of being subject to such a reduction in force shall have that notice rescinded and be returned to employment status as of September 30, 2025, without interruption\" and that those employees \"shall receive all pay to which they otherwise would have been entitled.\"",
      "Back pay for federal workers",
      "The continuing resolution explicitly provides money to provide back pay for federal employees, both those who have been furloughed and those who have continued to work.",
      "The legislation ensures that the workers who have missed paychecks since Oct. 1 will be made whole. Earlier in the shutdown, the White House had told agencies that a 2019 law ensuring back pay for workers might not apply to those on furlough.",
      "The relevant portion of federal law states that employees should be provided back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends,\" and the continuing resolution specifies that funds can be used to make the payments.",

    "summary": "Some Border Patrol agents could soon leave the Chicago area, after taking a leading role in the Trump administration's controversial immigration operations in the nation's third-largest city, officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has made plans for U.S. Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents to soon leave the Chicago area, three U.S. officials told CBS News Monday, after taking a leading role in a months-long crackdown that has been marked by controversial arrests and clashes with protesters.",
      "Bovino and many of the green-uniformed Border Patrol agents under his command could depart Chicago as early as later this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans.",
      "The plans could change, the officials cautioned, adding that some Customs and Border Protection personnel are expected to stay in Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration deployed more than 200 Border Patrol agents to Chicago, internal government documents show, directing them to play a major role in a highly visible and contentious crackdown in the Windy City known as Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "While the administration has argued the operation was designed to curtail crime and illegal immigration, Border Patrol's actions and presence in Chicago and its suburbs have been strongly decried by local leaders as heavy-handed and unjustified.",
      "Some of the Border Patrol teams dispatched to Chicago could be diverted to Charlotte, North Carolina for an operation that is expected to start there this month, the U.S. officials said. Immigration and Custom Enforcement, which has a field office in Chicago, is expected to continue carrying out immigration arrests in the region.",
      "Asked for comment, the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News, \"Every day DHS enforces the laws of this country, including in Chicago. We do not comment or telegraph future operations.\"",
      "Bovino, who once led a Border Patrol sector along the California-Mexico border, has become one of the most well-known figures enforcing President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration. Earlier this year, he led sweeping Border Patrol operations in the Los Angeles region that generated significant backlash, including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and car washes. Bovino personally participated in some of those sweeps.",
      "In Chicago and surrounding communities, Bovino has followed a similar playbook, joining Border Patrol agents in arrest operations that have often sparked tense confrontations with local residents. He's also joined federal agents when they've repelled protesters using tear gas, pepper balls, pepper spray and other tactics that have come under scrutiny. Agents have also been captured on video pointing guns at civilians.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis castigated the use of force employed by federal agents during the Chicago crackdown, questioning the justifications cited by Bovino during courtroom testimony. Ellis extended restrictions she first imposed last month that severely limit when federal officers can use tear gas and other crowd control tactics and weapons, and ordered Bovino and his agents to generally display identifiers and wear body-worn cameras.",
      "Trump administration officials have argued the use of force by federal agents has been justified due to violent acts by some protesters. On Monday, federal officials said they arrested a Mexican man in the U.S. illegally who allegedly shot at Border Patrol agents over the weekend.",
      "In an interview with CBS News last month, Bovino called the use of force by his agency \"exemplary,\" arguing his agents have followed internal protocols. He also said Border Patrol would accomplish its mission in Chicago \"when all the illegal aliens utilize the CBP home app and or we arrest 'em all,\" referring to an app that lets people in the U.S. illegally notify the government that they will self-deport.",
      "Further pressed on the \"marker of success\" in Chicago, Bovino said operations are aimed at both arrests and deterrence.",
      "\"That's part of any policing strategy \u2013 deterrence,\" Bovino said. \"Whether it's to deter a shoplifter in a department store or to deter illegal aliens from both coming across the border and remaining here.\"",

    "summary": "Gary Shapley became a hero of the political right after he blew the whistle on efforts to undermine the Hunter Biden tax probe.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS special agent-turned-whistleblower who has been tapped to lead criminal investigations at the tax agency told CBS News in an exclusive television interview he will let evidence, not politics, guide the agency's decisions on tax probes.",
      "\"Each and every time, I'm going to ensure the right thing's done and that the policies and procedures are followed,\" said Gary Shapley, who previously blew the whistle on what he says were efforts by the Department of Justice during the Biden administration to undermine the tax probe into the president's son Hunter. \"That's my credo.\"",
      "It's a position that could put him on a collision course with a White House that has pushed for investigations of the finances of left-wing groups. In September, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he is \"recommending that those funding Antifa be thoroughly investigated.\" Asked who should face investigation, Trump has singled out billionaire philanthropist George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, both prominent Democratic donors.",
      "Last month, Senate Democrats warned Shapley against using the IRS \"as a weapon to target political enemies.\"",
      "Shapley sat down with CBS News in his personal capacity, along with IRS special agent Joseph Ziegler, a rank-and-file IRS agent who first opened the Hunter Biden investigation. The two have co-authored a new book that will be released on Tuesday, detailing their whistleblowing efforts.",
      "Asked what assurances he could provide to anyone concerned about becoming a target of the IRS for political reasons, Shapley said the agency would not recommend \"something we don't believe the evidence is there to support.\"",
      "\"I put my neck on the line to protect what was right,\" Shapley said, referring to his protected whistleblower disclosures in the Hunter Biden case. \"I hope I don't have to, but I will do it again if I have to.\"",
      "In a statement responding to Mr. Trump's comments, a spokesperson for Soros' philanthropic foundation said all of its activities are \"peaceful and lawful.\"",
      "\"These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech,\" the statement read.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler spent much of their careers investigating tax crimes with virtually no public profile or involvement in the political battles in Washington. That changed after Ziegler began an investigation that led them to Hunter Biden, the president's son. They say they first made protected disclosures to their superiors at the IRS and through appropriate channels in the Justice Department in late 2022.",
      "They then came forward publicly in 2023, alleging the Justice Department \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The two agents alleged they were then removed from the Hunter Biden case and sidelined at the agency.",
      "\"We were retaliated against,\" said Ziegler. \"We were minimized. No one wanted to take us seriously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, their disclosures jump-started the case against Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to the tax crimes the agents had investigated after a Delaware judge rejected a broad immunity deal. President Biden ultimately pardoned his son for those crimes before leaving office.",
      "\"We came forward, under incredible scrutiny, provided the evidence, and ultimately, we changed the course,\" Shapley said, acknowledging he felt vindicated by Hunter Biden's guilty plea.",
      "Their story was touted by the political right as evidence of bias at the Justice Department and the IRS. In March, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent enlisted Shapley and Ziegler as senior advisers looking at ways to reform the tax agency. Neither Ziegler nor Shapley would discuss the specifics of their work, but acknowledged it involves adding new protections for whistleblowers.",
      "\"We are going to continue to support whistleblowers,\" said Zeigler. \"I'm looking to change what had happened that impacted our lives so much.\"",
      "Shapley spoke to CBS News as questions swirl around whether the Trump administration will insert politics into tax investigations. In April, Shapley was briefly installed as acting IRS commissioner, as officials with the Department of Government Efficiency sought to tighten their grip on the agency. Later this year he's set to take over the IRS's law enforcement arm, overseeing about 2,200 agents around the world.",
      "A career civil servant with two decades of experience, he said his decision to blow the whistle on the Biden administration did not secure him the new post, but it demonstrated his integrity and knack for standing up for what is right \u2014 two traits that qualified him for the job.",
      "\"It doesn't matter who's in office,\" he said. \"Every single day I approach my job the same way.\"",
      "In their October letter, a group of more than a dozen senators asked Shapley about changes he intended to make at the agency, and also delivered a stark warning.",
      "\"Any effort to weaponize the IRS against President Trump's perceived enemies is against the law, an abuse of power, and a threat to the integrity of our democratic institutions,\" the senators wrote, adding Shapley's team \"cannot be the President's political attack dog.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.",
      "\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"",
      "The reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.",
      "The resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections.

      "But the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.",
      "\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "The Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.",
      "The eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused to budge \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure.",
      "\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"",
      "\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.",
      "\"And we're going to live to fight another day \u2014 and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"",
      "Critics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.",
      "\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.",
      "\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.",
      "For his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.",
      "\"I must vote no \u2014 this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Late last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.",
      "The New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

      "Asked by CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns whether he viewed Sunday's vote to advance the deal as a \"capitulation,\" Sanders responded: \"I'll try to think of a word, but that's not a bad one.\"",
      "The bill \u2014 which still needs to formally pass the Senate and House \u2014 would fund the government until late January, ending the longest shutdown in modern history, and it would roll back federal layoffs imposed during the shutdown and advance a handful of bills to fund parts of the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, 2026.",
      "In exchange, Republicans have promised to hold a vote by next month on extending a set of enhanced health insurance tax credits that were passed during the Biden administration and are set to expire this year. Without an extension, many Americans who buy insurance on Affordable Care Act exchanges could face significantly higher premiums.",
      "Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, called the deal a \"disaster\" since there's no guarantee that the expiring health insurance subsidies will be extended. The senator was unimpressed by the promise to hold a vote.",
      "\"It's a meaningless vote, because even if it got 100 votes in the Senate, it's not going to go anywhere in the House and the president certainly would not sign it,\" Sanders told CBS News. \"Maybe people feel good about having a vote, but it doesn't mean anything at all.\"",
      "The Democrats who backed the deal have argued Republicans were unwilling to negotiate further. They also point to the pain inflicted by the 41-day-long shutdown, including a delay to full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, a freeze in paychecks for most federal workers and mass disorder at American airports due to air traffic controller shortages.",
      "\"I just refuse to shut our government down and hold our government hostage,\" Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who voted for the deal, said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "But Sanders argued the chaos of the shutdown was caused by President Trump and his allies, who he said are \"responsible for this crisis\" because they are \"refusing to negotiate.\"",
      "He also expressed frustration with the Democrats who voted yes, accusing them of making \"a very profound decision without really, to be honest, a lot of caucus discussion.\"",
      "Sanders calls Schumer an \"establishment Democrat\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, voted against the deal, but some Democrats have criticized his handling of the process, with a handful of House members calling for him to step down as caucus leader.",
      "Asked if Schumer should be replaced, Sanders replied: \"By whom? That's the point.\"",
      "But he offered a less-than-ringing endorsement of the top Senate Democrat, who Sanders said belongs to the party's \"corporate wing.\" Sanders also said \"it goes deeper than Schumer.\"",
      "\"Schumer's views are very different than mine. He is an establishment Democrat. No secret, I am not,\" he said. \"I hope that by electing new members of the Senate, we will have, in fact, new leadership. But right now, it is what it is.\"",

      "According to court filings in Utah, Banuelos allegedly invited the victim of the attack, referred to in the court filings only as S.J., to his home in June 2018, falsely claiming there was a party at the house. According to charging documents, Banuelos beat the victim after she entered his house.",
      "Prosecutors said the victim told investigators that Banuelos \"hit her in the face and told her he was going to kill her.\u00a0 Banuelos then grabbed her by the shirt and dropped her on the floor, causing her to hit her head.

Banuelos' case was unique among the tonnage of Capitol riot prosecutions, because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
      "The Justice Department alleged \"Open-source media and CCTV captured Banuelos allegedly raising the gun over his head and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air.

    "story": [
      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",
      "On Monday, he was likely to ask the leader of the world's wealthiest nation to help however he can.",

      "President Trump has pardoned dozens of people who allegedly tried to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including those who were named as so-called \"alternate state electors\" to certify the results. Ed Martin, a Justice Department attorney whose focus is pardons, posted what appeared to be the\u00a0pardons document on social media, which was later confirmed by the White House.",
      "In addition to these alleged false electors, others granted pardons include former Trump personal lawyer and one-time close Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021. More than 70 people are named in the document as receiving pardons.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects presidents. In 48 states, they vote for the candidate who won a state's popular vote; elector votes in Maine and Nebraska are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",
      "The pardon document, dated Nov. 7, starts out by saying it \"ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "In a statement Monday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy.\"",
      "The document also says the pardon doesn't apply to Mr. Trump. That circumvents, at least for now, the issue of whether a president can pardon himself.",
      "The attempt to appoint alternate electors formed a core part of a federal indictment against Mr. Trump that was abandoned by the Justice Department earlier this year shortly before he returned to the White House.",
      "He was accused of participating in a scheme to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. The federal indictment accused him and others of spreading \"lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won,\" ultimately leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Mr. Trump denied wrongdoing.",
      "Presidents can't pardon people charged with state crimes.",

      "Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania and claims he made in a federal lawsuit that elections boards there were engaged in a scheme to rig the election against Mr. Trump. He later\u00a0declared bankruptcy after being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.",
      "He was also indicted in Arizona for allegedly spreading false claims that the the 2020 election there had been marred by fraud.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, said in a statement, \"Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" He said Giuliani \"stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election\" and \"deserves to have his bar license immediately reinstated.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn its landmark decision on same-sex marriage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not reconsider its landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, rejecting a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn the decision.",
      "Davis, who served as the Rowan County clerk, drew national attention when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to gay and straight couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that the 14th Amendment guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.",
      "Soon after the ruling, then-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear sent a letter to all Kentucky county clerks directing them to immediately license and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. But Davis had said that affixing her name to marriage licenses for gay couples would violate her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.",
      "Kentucky later enacted a law that removed clerks' names and signatures from its marriage licenses. But until then, Davis and her deputies denied marriage licenses to several same-sex couples, including David Moore and David Ermold.",
      "The pair sought a marriage license from the Rowan County Clerk's Office 10 days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. But Davis refused to issue one, instead telling them she was acting \"under God's authority\" and advising them to go to another county for a marriage license.",
      "Moore and Ermold sued several days later, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional right to marry. They continued to return to the Rowan County Clerk's Office and were repeatedly denied a marriage license by Davis and her deputies. Moore and Ermold eventually secured a marriage license from a Rowan County deputy clerk in September 2015, when Davis was jailed for five days for refusing to issue marriage licenses in defiance of a court order.",
      "Still, the couple pursued monetary damages as a result of Davis' actions, and a jury awarded them $50,000 apiece.",
      "Davis appealed the decision, arguing that because issuing Moore and Ermold a marriage license would have violated her constitutionally protected religious beliefs, she cannot be held liable. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed, and ruled that the First Amendment does not shield Davis from liability because she was acting in her capacity as a government official.",
      "\"In their 'private lives,' government officials are of course free to express their views and live according to their faith. But when an official wields state power against private citizens, her conscience must yield to the Constitution,\" Judge Helene White wrote for the court.",
      "The 6th Circuit warned that if it were to accept Davis' argument, county clerks who find interracial marriage sinful could refuse to issue licenses to interracial couples, or a zoning official opposed to Christianity could deny a permit for construction of a church.",
      "\"[W]hen an official's discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the Constitution must win out,\" White wrote. \"The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official's conscience so dictates.\"",
      "Davis appealed to the Supreme Court. In addition to asking the justices to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, her lawyers asked them to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Her petition raised concerns that the 10-year-old decision could be at risk, particularly given the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider a number of its decisions based on the principle of substantive due process, including the right to same-sex marriage and contraception.",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and it was unclear whether four of the justices agreed that Obergefell should be reconsidered, and five would vote to overturn it.",

      "The Trump administration initially said last month that it would not fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November because of the ongoing government shutdown. The twists and turns since have exacerbated uncertainty for the nearly 1 in 8 Americans who receive monthly SNAP benefits to spend at grocery stores and farmers' markets.",
      "On Friday, some states began issuing full monthly SNAP benefits to people, a day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the funds. Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey were among the states that said on Friday they were moving to issue full benefits to SNAP recipients.",
      "But Friday night, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0temporarily paused that judicial order\u00a0to give an appeals court in Boston time to decide whether to issue a more lasting halt. Jackson acted because she handles emergency matters from Massachusetts.",
      "Jackson's move will also keep on hold a ruling late Sunday night from the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that let a Rhode Island judge's order stand that directs the Trump administration to fully fund this month's SNAP benefits.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and the Department of Agriculture for additional comments on the new guidance.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said there is no clarity from the government on funding SNAP benefits over the last several days.",
      "\"There is a chaos and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration and where they have money for everything,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything but when it's to supporting the people, that's now when they are crying, well, we are broke and that's not what the law requires us to do.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, on Sunday called the directive \"shocking\" if it applies to states, like hers, that used their own money to prop up the program.",
      "\"It's one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, no, this can't be done,\" Murkowski said. \"But when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we're going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.\"",
      "Democratic Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts said SNAP benefits were processed and placed on EBT cards before the U.S. Supreme Court order Friday night, in line with the previous guidance from the USDA. She said that if Trump attempts to claw back the money, \"we will see him in court.\"",
      "\"Massachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food,\" she said in a statement Sunday. \"President Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families.\"",
      "Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, for help buying groceries. Most have incomes below the poverty line, which is about $32,000 for a family of four.",
      "An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.",
      "The delay in payments has led to a surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the country, as well as long lines for free meals or drive-thru giveaways.",
      "Some states have provided emergency funding to food banks to help them respond to the increased need. Some states also used their own dollars to fund direct payments to people while the federal benefits were in limbo.",

      "As if deadly snakes, spiders\u00a0and sharks\u00a0were not enough, Australia now has a new creepy critter: a \"lucifer\" bee with devil-like horns.",
      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:44 -0500",
    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition.

      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Sally Kirkland was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna.\"",
    "story": [
      "Sally Kirkland, a onetime model who turned to acting and was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna,\" has died, her representative confirmed to the Associated Press. She was 84.",
      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",
      "Kirkland volunteered for people who had AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for inmates, especially young people.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-californias-redistricting-maps/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:17:15 -0500",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake city.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, speading out making Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "ByHeart, a manufacturer of organic baby formula, recalled all of its products sold nationwide Tuesday, days after some batches were recalled in an expanding outbreak of infant botulism.",
      "At least 15 babies in 12 states have been sickened in the outbreak since August, with more cases pending, according to state and federal health officials. All of the infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart formula, officials said. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart officials expanded the voluntary recall from two lots announced Saturday to all products in consumers' homes and in stores. That includes ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula and Anywhere Pack pouches of powdered formula.",
      "\"The decision to broaden our recall to all ByHeart products comes after a call with the FDA late last night, informing us that they found two more cases of infant botulism in babies that had also consumed ByHeart at some point,\" Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the cofounders of ByHeart, said in an open\u00a0letter\u00a0Tuesday on the company's website.",
      "\"The FDA's investigation into infant botulism in the U.S. is still ongoing, and we feel that there are still too many unanswered questions,\" they said. \"Your baby's safety is, and always will be, our biggest priority.\"",
      "The company sells about 200,000 cans of infant formula a month online and in stores such as Target, Walmart, Albertsons and Whole Foods, according to Dr. Devon Kuehn, chief medical officer.",
      "Parents and caregivers who have the formula in their homes \"should immediately discontinue use and dispose of the product,\" Kuehn said.",
      "ByHeart said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0it enacted the unusual recall \"in close collaboration\" with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \"despite the fact that no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive\" for the contamination.",
      "\"It's important that you know that neither we, nor the FDA or CDC, have found Clostridium botulinum spores or toxins in any unopened can of ByHeart formula,\" Funt and Belldegrun said in their open letter.",
      "The company said its recall will remain in place while the FDA investigates the cause of the botulism outbreak. At the same time, ByHeart said it will test \"every batch of formula with an independent third-party laboratory\u2014a process which has already begun,\" and allow access to its facilities and unopened products for the FDA and California health officials to test \"without restriction.\"",
      "California health officials earlier confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who got sick contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak.",
      "The FDA is investigating 84 cases of infant botulism detected since August. Of those, 36 consumed infant formula, with a more than a third who received ByHeart formula, the agency said in a statement.",
      "\"This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,\" the FDA statement said.",
      "ByHeart produces formula powder at a plant in Allerton, Iowa, and then ships it to a site in Portland, Oregon, for canning and distribution, Kuehn said. FDA inspectors were at the Portland plant Monday, she added.",
      "Infant botulism is a rare and serious illness that occurs in babies under age 1, whose gut microbiomes are immature. It is caused when the infants consume bacteria that contain spores that produce a toxin in the gut. Symptoms include constipation, poor feeding, drooping eyelid, weak muscle tone, difficulty swallowing and breathing problems, among others.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-50-year-mortgage-loan-bill-pulte-cost/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:25:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable? The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan.",
      "Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "The proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",

      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News interview on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",

      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",

      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",

      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",

      "Mr. Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial of the federal case, calling Carroll's claims \"implausible\" and arguing testimony stretched \"credulity past the breaking point.\" He has since promised to challenge the case all the way to the nation's highest court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Mr. Trump's appeal in December 2024, and in June rejected a request for an en banc review, in which all the judges on the court consider the case.",
      "The Supreme Court is now his last hope of overturning the jury's unanimous verdict. The jury found that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Mr. Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store, sticking his fingers into her vagina.",
      "The jury rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, though the trial judge, Lewis Kaplan, later wrote that the conclusion that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll by forcefully inserting his fingers was an \"implicit determination that Mr. Trump digitally raped her.\"",

      "An attorney for Carroll did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Carroll's legal team received some of its funding from a nonprofit tied to a Democratic megadonor, but has said in legal filings Carroll was not involved in obtaining the outside funds, which they received nearly a year after she filed her first lawsuit. They've said the funding was irrelevant to her sexual abuse and defamation claims.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations since they first surfaced in 2019, when she went public with a book excerpt published in New York Magazine.",
      "He has also appealed a separate federal jury verdict in January 2024 that found him liable for making further defamatory statements\u00a0 against Carroll. Combined, the two juries awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",

      "\"There is nothing that we would spare to try to save the life of the miner,\" West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey\u00a0told reporters\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Morrisey said Monday night that crews had already pumped millions of gallons of water out of the mining complex but had about 2.7 million more to go before rescuers could safely enter it. A simultaneous drilling operation could potentially allow rescuers to reach the miner a different way, the governor said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "\"While estimates from setup and completion vary for each method, using both approaches together offers the clearest path to success,\" he said.",
      "The miner is the foreman of a 17-person team that struck a pocket of water inside of south-central West Virginia's Rolling Thunder Mine, causing water to rush into the complex, said Nicholas County Commissioner Garret Cole, citing information from the local emergency management and homeland security agency as well as reporting by CBS News affiliate WOWK. Rolling Thunder Mine is in Nicholas County.",
      "All of the other miners were accounted for in the aftermath of the flood, Cole said on Facebook late Sunday. Officials believe the foreman helped the team escape the flooding and that he is about three-quarters of a mile into the mine.",
      "Morrisey said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0that \"a section of the mine operation flooded after an old mine wall was compromised.\"",
      "Multiple local, state and federal agencies were involved in the search, in addition to specialized mining, cave diving and drilling crews attempting to pump water out of the mine, Cole said. By 8:45 p.m. local time Sunday, dive teams had entered the mine for a third time.",
      "\"From reporting from homeland security and media, it is amazing to see the mobilization of these many agencies getting to work so quickly and working around the clock in order to move as quickly, and safely as humanly possible,\" he said.",
      "In an update Monday, Nicholas County Commissioner Cole said the governor said there had been concerns about removing water while dive crews are simultaneously deployed, so crews were trying to remove the water as fast as possible.",
      "Cole said that coal seams inside the mine have \"created air pockets in the 'peaks' of the mine,\" and that officials hope the miner was able to find them.",
      "\"It was stated to me that the air and water is approximately 52-54 degrees, which means the miner would be less likely to suffer hypothermia, but would more be tasked in trying to become dry and keep in an open air pocket of the mine,\" Cole said.",
      "The commissioner called the emergency response \"a learning experience\" for him, in part because of the challenges the mine's terrain presents to search and rescue crews, and the fact that \"it takes so much time to safely and properly\" reenter it.",
      "\"This is a waiting game, in a most unfortunate way,\" Cole said.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to fewer turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee death row inmate Harold Wayne Nichols on Monday declined to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection for his Dec. 11 execution, meaning the state will default to lethal injection.",
      "Nichols was sentenced to death in 1990 after he was convicted of raping and murdering Karen Pulley, a 21-year-old student at Chattanooga State University, two years earlier. He has two weeks to change his mind about choosing which method will be used, Tennessee Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter said in an email.",
      "He was scheduled to be executed in 2020, and had chosen the electric chair, but was then given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tennessee inmates who were convicted of crimes before January 1999 are permitted to choose electrocution over the state's preferred method of lethal injection.",
      "The electric chair has only been used to carry out five executions over the last decade, all of which took place in Tennessee. But several other states still have electrocution as an option for the death penalty, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana and South Carolina. In South Carolina, electrocution is the default method of execution if lethal injection drugs aren't available, according to a 2021 state law.",
      "At the time that Nichols selected electrocution, Tennessee's lethal injection protocol used three different drugs in series. It was a process that inmates' attorneys claimed was riddled with problems. Their concerns were shown to have merit in 2022, when Gov. Bill Lee paused executions while an independent investigation that he ordered to examine the state's death penalty procedures got underway, CBS affiliate\u00a0WDEF reported at the time.",
      "Postponing what had been a second execution date for Nichols, in addition to several others, the investigation was conducted by former U.S. Attorney Ed Stanton and came in response to concerns over whether the state's lethal injection drugs had been properly tested, according to WDEF.",
      "The review of the state's lethal injection process found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed in Tennessee since 2018 had been properly tested.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-sued-over-hunting-of-bears-from-the-air-to-protect-caribou/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:19:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Conservation groups sued over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd.",
    "story": [
      "Juneau, Alaska \u2014\u00a0Conservation groups sued Monday over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd in the southwest part of the state. The groups allege the program lacks a scientific basis and is unconstitutional.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court says the program adopted by the Alaska Board of Game in July doesn't require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor bear populations to ensure their numbers remain sustainable. It also says the program - carried out by department employees and allowing them to shoot from helicopters - sets no limits on how many bears can be killed in an area that's roughly the size of Indiana.",
      "Filed by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, the lawsuit lists as defendants the state, the board, the Department of Fish and Game and the department's commissioner. A message seeking comment was sent to the Alaska Department of Law, which typically represents state agencies in litigation.",
      "Monday's lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing legal fight over what Fish and Game has cast as an effort to restore the Mulchatna caribou herd. The herd, named for its traditional calving ground, peaked in number at around 190,000 in the late 1990s and had provided an important source of food for subsistence hunters from dozens of communities. But the herd's numbers began falling, down to about 13,000 caribou by 2019, and hunting has not been allowed since 2021, according to the department.",
      "The department has said that factors such as disease, hunting, food availability and quality, and predation can affect caribou survival, and in this case, the board determined it could address predation. It said it's responding to requests to help rebuild the herd and restore the caribou as a food source for the region.",
      "In a fall newsletter, the department said bears and wolves \"have been identified as significant calf predators.\" It said an aerial survey last fall indicated the ratio of calves to cows in the herd's western subgroup was the highest recorded since 1999. It said this suggested a \"positive response\" to its 2023 and 2024 predator control program targeting bears and wolves on calving grounds.",
      "According to the lawsuit, in May 2023 the agency killed \"every single brown and black bear it found within the 1,200-square-mile focus area encompassing the western Mulchatna caribou herd calving grounds.\" Altogether, in 2023 and 2024, 180 bears, most brown bears, were killed, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Alaska Wildlife Alliance previously sued to end the program. In that case, a judge in March found fault with the process in which it was adopted and concluded the state lacked data on bear sustainability in the region before implementing the program.",
      "But the board and department pushed ahead, implementing emergency regulations under which 11 bears were killed before those were struck down by another judge.",
      "The department later announced a public comment process surrounding plans to reauthorize the program, which Monday's lawsuit said incorporates elements that were struck down in the March ruling. The plan adopted by the board in July authorizes the program to continue through 2028, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"We were trying to rebuild the caribou herd, but we're not going to jeopardize long-term sustainability of bears in so doing,\" the department's commissioner, Doug Vincent-Lang, said in a statement after the board's action.",
      "He said there was \"strong evidence that neither disease nor nutrition are preventing this herd from recovering\" and that predation \"has been isolated as the limiting factor preventing the herd from growing.\"",
      "Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said the program \"threatens bears who move across vast stretches of public lands.\"",
      "\"Instead of setting up the program to be measurable and accountable, it was clearly established to kill as many bears as possible first, then ask questions later,\" she says in a press release. \"The Board of Game can't pass a bear control program without safeguards for bear sustainability.\"",
      "Schmitt said in a statement Monday that sections of the area in which bears can be killed are near Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, about 30 miles from Katmai National Park and Preserve and near wildlife refuges.",
      "Michelle Sinnott, staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska, called the program unconstitutional. She said it \"hands Fish and Game a blank check to destroy bears across an entire region with impunity. The Board of Game has once again shirked its constitutional obligations and ignored prior court decisions in its unscientific and relentless war on predator animals.\"",

    "summary": "Use of force by federal agents has become a focus of legal disputes as the Trump administration contends the tactics are necessary. Our visual investigation breaks down some of the key moments.",
    "story": [
      "You've seen the videos in newscasts and social feeds: Federal agents employing chokeholds, firing pepper spray at close range, and even using vehicle maneuvers to control immigration protests.",
      "These videos have spurred debate over whether agents have violated federal policies on use of force, which is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "A review of hundreds of videos, most recorded on cellphones by protesters and posted online, shows repeated instances that don't appear to meet that standard.",
      "We asked Eric Balliet, a career federal agent who worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than two decades, to review some of the tactics used in these videos. Balliet led internal investigations into use of force misconduct for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until last year.",
      "\"This isn't policing and law enforcement as I practiced it for 25 years,\" he said.",
      "Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino, who is leading the federal agents responding to protests in Chicago, disagrees.",
      "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,\" Bovino said in an interview with CBS News. \"Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Protesters and media organizations in Chicago have filed a complaint in federal court about the tactics employed under Bovino's command, as well as those captured on video recordings in Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles and other cities. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order blocking federal agents from deploying chemical spray, tear gas or any other less-lethal weapon \"unless such force is necessary to stop the immediate threat of physical harm to another.\" The Trump administration has filed an appeal.",
      "DHS is now racing to file its implementation guidance in response to the judge's order. Revised directives informing DHS personnel of banned use-of-force tactics must be issued by the end of the day Tuesday.",
      "\"I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,\" Ellis said in her ruling from the bench.",
      "\"The use of force shocks the conscience,\" Ellis said.",
      "But President Trump said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month that the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"haven't gone far enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know where the leadership is here,\" said Balliet. \"It seems to be non-existent. Any oversight and justification for the use of force seems to be absent across the board.\"",
      "Balliet reviewed dozens of videos at the request of CBS News, and he identified several clear areas of concern with the tactics he saw in use against demonstrators.",
      "Firing less-than-lethal munitions at protesters' heads and torsos",
      "Videos taken outside the ICE facilities show federal agents standing several stories above protesters and shooting less-than-lethal munitions towards their heads and torsos.",
      "One cellphone video from September, taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, shows a priest looking up toward agents standing several stories above him. In the video, agents fire pepper balls that land nearby him, and explode on the ground. One agent then fires a pepper ball that strikes the man in the head, and he crumbles to the ground.",
      "Agency policy prohibits agents from firing at anyone above the waist, stating they \"shall not intentionally target the head, neck, groin, or female breast.\"",
      "Balliet says such incidents show a lack of proper training.",
      "\"They are elevating the force to a degree that is excessive,\" Balliet said.",
      "During an interview, CBS News showed Bovino the September video and asked him if the agent had breached department policy. He said the agent had not \u2014 because the protesters were \"trespassing\" on federal grounds and the use of pepper balls didn't deviate from policy.",
      "\"The use of that less-lethal device, a pepper ball, was absolutely in line with policy. And I applaud them for protecting that federal facility there.\" He said use of force outside of the Broadview facility has been \"exemplary.\"",
      "Tear gas and pepper spray at close range",
      "Videos collected from Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles show agents deploying large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, sometimes at close range.",
      "In one October cellphone video from Portland, a federal agent can be seen spraying a form of tear gas called \"oleoresin capsicum\" spray directly at an individual protester at close range and in high volume.",
      "The protester can be seen verbally confronting two agents in the street. Another agent then walks up to the protester and sprays her directly in the face with a large can of pepper spray.",
      "\"If you take direct shots to the eye, it can scratch or prick your cornea,\" said Balliet. In his experience, agents have gone to the emergency room for eye damage after being sprayed at similar ranges with this type of munition.",
      "DHS policy allows the deployment of chemical irritants only in cases when subjects offer \"active resistance.\" The footage shows protesters yelling but not physically threatening the agents, which Balliet said was not a sufficient provocation for this level of response.",
      "\"For this particular one, it's a little disturbing because there does not appear to be any sort of de-escalation attempt,\" Balliet said.",
      "Vehicle maneuvers used as deadly force",
      "Cellphone videos have also caught federal agents in several cities using vehicles to push or move\u00a0 demonstrators.",
      "In one video from Chicago, an agent in an unmarked federal vehicle slowly drives into a protester. The agent can be heard yelling, \"I'm gonna slam you on the f****** ground,\" as the vehicle makes contact with the demonstrator.",
      "Balliet says driving a vehicle into a protester constitutes \"deadly force,\" or what the DHS use of force policy defines as \"action that carries a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"",
      "\"Anytime you introduce a vehicle into an already volatile situation, it drastically changes the dynamics,\" Balliet said. \"It rises into that deadly force arena.\"",
      "The fact that the vehicle was unmarked and the lack of communication created further risk, he said. A protester in the video can be heard saying, \"Who are you?\" as the car continues to push into the demonstrator.",
      "\"I can't stress enough the significance of markings,\" Balliet said. \"When you blur the line in that world, it presents a danger to everyone involved.\"",
      "Prohibited chokeholds and hand-on contact",
      "Videos received by CBS News reveal agents using aggressive hands-on tactics, including chokeholds, which DHS policy forbids unless the \"deadly force\" is authorized.",
      "\"Chokeholds and carotid restraints must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest,\" states a 2023 DHS Use of Force policy.",
      "But in two videos from Chicago, federal agents are seen putting their hands or arms directly around the necks of protesters during tense encounters. In one Broadview incident, agents surround a female protester who is attempting to block a car from leaving the facility. An agent, who is masked but not wearing a helmet, even as other agents fire pepperballs from an elevated location, puts his arm around her throat. Another officer then pulls the man off the woman and she is released.",
      "\"It's considered lethal force for a reason,\" Balliet said. \"If I were the commander, that individual would be off the team 30 seconds after it happened.\"",
      "In another Chicago video, a Border Patrol agent places his hands around the neck of a protester and slams him onto the ground. As the agent engages in the hands-on approach, he swings his rifle behind him, leaving the muzzle of his potentially loaded gun unprotected.",
      "\"The fact that that weapon, that M4, is just flailing around muzzling the agents, muzzling the crowd, is basically begging some bad actor to grab it,\" said Balliet. \"It's good that somebody didn't get extremely hurt or killed in this.\"",
      "Agents commended by commander, despite alleged violations of DHS policy",
      "Bovino confirmed no one has been disciplined in Chicago in connection to incidents documented during Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Bovino said when asked if anyone acted outside policy.",
      "But Balliet said he believes the lack of accountability could have long-term negative consequences for federal law enforcement.",
      "\"This is gonna have an irreparable harm to the trust and faith that the general public has in its law enforcement officers,\" he said. \"It is creating a divide that is going to take years \u2014 if it can ever be fully repaired.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal agents are \"trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The agency argued that protesters have \"thrown rocks, bottles, and fireworks\" at agents, \"slashed the tires of their vehicles, rammed them, ambushed them, and \u2026destroyed multiple law enforcement vehicles.\"",
      "\"Despite these real dangers, our law enforcement shows incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated,\" the agency statement said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate took a major\u00a0step toward ending the government shutdown late Monday by passing a funding bill that unlocks a broader agreement on long-term spending and the promise of a future vote on extending health care tax credits.",
      "The vote was 60-40, with eight Democrats providing the votes needed. One Republican voted against it.",
      "The eight Democrats had been engaged in bipartisan talks over ending the stalemate for several weeks, and reached the agreement without the support of the party's leaders in the upper chamber. The House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday, and if it passes, it will go to President Trump's desk.",
      "The agreement they struck does nothing to address the expiring health care tax credits \u2014 which had been their party's key demand \u2014 besides the promise of a future vote on the issue. The deal left many Democrats furious with the eight senators who voted to advance it and with the party's leaders for allowing the defections.",
      "Here's what is in the agreement:",
      "Government funding extension until Jan. 30",
      "The final deal will include a 31-page continuing resolution that extends current levels of government funding through January 2026 to give lawmakers more time to finalize full-year spending bills.",
      "The House passed a continuing resolution to extend funding until Nov. 21 in September, but until Sunday the Senate was unable to advance it. With that deadline less than two weeks away, Senate negotiators determined that they would need another extension to continue work on appropriations.",
      "Some senators had floated a December deadline in a new continuing resolution, but House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed that possibility, since it would pressure lawmakers to approve new spending before the holidays.",
      "A future vote on health care tax credits",
      "As part of the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which help millions of Americans purchase health insurance on state exchanges. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and patients are facing eye-popping increases for their insurance premiums.",
      "Under the deal, a vote would be held by the end of the second week of December, and the Democrats would have final say on what is in the bill.",
      "But a Senate vote on the issue is likely to fail, since most GOP senators are opposed to the Affordable Care Act overall and the tax credits in particular.",
      "That fact explains why so many Democrats are angry over the agreement, since it does not include an extension of the credits and only promises a future vote. That offer has also been on the table for weeks.",
      "\"There's no way to defend this,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a video on X. \"And you are right to be angry about it. I'm angry about it.\"",
      "Last Friday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the credits. Republicans swiftly rejected Schumer's pitch, and spent Saturday railing against the ACA in speeches on the Senate floor.",
      "A \"minibus\" of 3 appropriations bills",
      "The deal includes three yearlong funding bills that lawmakers have been working on for months. The three bills include funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "The bills have been dubbed a \"minibus\" \u2014 a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation that lawmakers often adopt before the end of the year. Republicans in both chambers have emphasized their desire to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, instead of through a large end-of-year package.",
      "The minibus includes funding for the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026. Because of that, the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to reach a funding deal in other areas by the end of January.",
      "Notably, it would restore full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which faced funding shortfalls due to the shutdown.",
      "A reversal of shutdown layoffs and restrictions on future cuts",
      "The new continuing resolution includes language that reverses the layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the government shutdown, and prevents any cuts until the end of January.",
      "The resolution states that \"any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an Executive Agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.\" A reduction in force, or RIF, is the government's term for layoffs.",
      "The resolution also says that \"no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the Federal Government\" until Jan. 30.",
      "The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal employees during the early stages of the shutdown, an effort that was blocked by a federal judge.",
      "The continuing resolution says that \"Any employee who received notice of being subject to such a reduction in force shall have that notice rescinded and be returned to employment status as of September 30, 2025, without interruption\" and that those employees \"shall receive all pay to which they otherwise would have been entitled.\"",
      "Back pay for federal workers",
      "The continuing resolution explicitly provides money to provide back pay for federal employees, both those who have been furloughed and those who have continued to work.",
      "The legislation ensures that the workers who have missed paychecks since Oct. 1 will be made whole. Earlier in the shutdown, the White House had told agencies that a 2019 law ensuring back pay for workers might not apply to those on furlough.",
      "The relevant portion of federal law states that employees should be provided back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends,\" and the continuing resolution specifies that funds can be used to make the payments.",

      "Washington \u2014 The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.",
      "\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"",
      "The reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.",
      "The resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.",
      "The shutdown deal",
      "The Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.",
      "But the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.",
      "\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "The Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.",
      "The eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused to budge \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure.",
      "\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"",
      "\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.",
      "\"And we're going to live to fight another day \u2014 and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"",
      "Critics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.",
      "\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.",
      "\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.",
      "For his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.",
      "\"I must vote no \u2014 this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Late last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.",
      "The New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is spending his early prison days working in the chapel and enrolled in an intensive drug treatment program, according to prison documents exclusively obtained by CBS News. He has also found himself facing disciplinary action for an unauthorized phone call, just days after being transferred to a federal prison in New Jersey, with the looming possibility of temporarily losing his phone and commissary privileges as a result.",
      "Combs was moved to the Fort Dix prison on Oct. 30 after being sentenced to more than four years on prostitution-related charges. The photo below, first obtained by CBS News, was taken for prison records upon his arrival.",
      "The documents offer a glimpse at how the hip-hop mogul is spending his prison days \u2014 in a hard-to-get-into treatment program and on a coveted work assignment, even as he is accused of flouting a prison rule.",
      "A prestigious work assignment",
      "Combs is working as a chaplain's assistant, which is considered one of the more desirable assignments at the Fort Dix prison. A former prison commissioner told CBS News the tasks vary, but typically inmates maintain the chaplain's religious library, clean their office and help with some record-keeping.",
      "Combs' publicist, Juda Engelmayer, told CBS News, \"He works in the chapel library, where he describes the environment as warm, respectful, and rewarding.\"",
      "What makes the assignment especially desirable is that it has prestige within the prison, the former commissioner said. It allows the inmate to work in a private office, often with air conditioning, and chaplains frequently bring in food for religious services which can be shared with the assistant.",
      "A corrections officer who worked in federal prisons for more than 20 years told CBS News the chapel is one of the only places where inmates can congregate freely.",
      "Chaplains can also allow their assistants to prepare a call-out list, which tells officers which inmates are allowed to leave their cell to go to programs or medical appointments. Assistants could add their connections or friends to the list.",
      "Combs, who said he was raised Catholic, has spoken publicly about not identifying with any specific denomination, although he has in recent years referenced God several times. In 2017, he wrote on social media, \"God puts us all thru things for reason,\" and he was seen reading the Bible in the courtroom during his trial.",
      "An unauthorized team call",
      "Within a few days of his arrival at the prison, Combs found himself in trouble: He made a three-person call on Nov. 3, in violation of prison rules. He told officials it was a conversation with his legal team about issuing a statement to The New York Times.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons prohibits inmates from adding multiple people to a call, and inmates can only speak to people on prison phones from previously approved call lists, under longstanding security rules.",
      "According to the documents, he called an unnamed woman, and about halfway through their call, Combs said he needed to talk with someone described as \"the digital person\" regarding blogs. The woman asked Combs if she should add that person to the call and he said \"yes.\" Combs first spoke briefly with the woman about arranging visitors for the weekend and suggested they bring cash\u00a0\u2014 \"200 singles.\" There is no indication as to how he intended to use the money. Prison regulations bar visitors from bringing in currency other than coins for the vending machines.",
      "After they finished speaking about visitation, the woman added an unknown male to the call \u2014 circumventing prison rules.",
      "Combs later explained that he was speaking with his attorney and she added the head of legal communications to work on a statement for his approval to be sent to The Times. He said they were not talking about blogs. It was not made clear why Combs was putting together a statement for the news organization.",
      "Multi-person calls are banned in prisons because of concerns that inmates could use them to coordinate criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, gang violence or witness intimidation. However, such calls can also be used for more innocent purposes, such as talking to two loved ones at the same time.",
      "One corrections officer told CBS News, for example, \"They'll call their girlfriend, and ask them to add their mother.\" The source added that inmates run the risk of getting caught but know corrections officers can't truly monitor the thousands of calls taking place within federal prisons daily. There are over 4,100 inmates at FCI Fort Dix alone.",
      "According to prison documents, Combs said no one had informed him about the regulations on phone calls, and he said he never received the prison admission and orientation handbook.",
      "Prison officials recommended Combs lose 90 days of phone privileges and 90 days of commissary privileges for the infraction. Their ruling was filed on Nov. 4 \u2014 Combs' 56th birthday. It's unclear if the recommended penalty has been implemented.",
      "\"This is a serious offense that shows a disregard for the rules,\" a source close to the investigation said.",
      "Engelmayer told CBS News, \"It was a procedural call initiated by one of his attorneys and was protected under attorney client privilege. There was nothing improper.\"",
      "Combs' lead attorney Marc Agnifilo did not comment.",
      "An intensive drug treatment program",
      "Combs has been assigned to the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) unit, known as the Bureau's most intensive drug treatment program. Correctional officials told CBS News that inmates need to qualify for the program, and one source said most inmates don't get placed in an RDAP at the start of their sentence.",
      "Sentences can be reduced up to one year by participating in the drug treatment program, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "\"Mr. Combs is an active participant in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) and has taken his rehabilitation process seriously from the start,\" Engelmayer said. \"He is fully engaged in his work, focused on growth, and committed to positive change.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers had written to the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that Combs be allowed \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts.\"",
      "During his trial, Combs' attorneys referred to his drug use as a primary driver of his infamous \"freak-offs.\" In a letter to the judge before sentencing, Combs blamed drugs and excess for his actions and said he was \"now sober for the first time in 25 years,\" adding that he had been trying his best \"to deal with my drug abuse and anger issues.\"",
      "\"Prison will change you or kill you \u2014 I choose to live,\" Combs wrote in his sentencing memo.",

    "story": [
      "As lawmakers inch closer to a deal to\u00a0end the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history, hundreds of thousands of government workers who've gone without pay are wondering when their paychecks could finally arrive.",
      "It's still unclear when the shutdown might end, though the Senate is working to finalize a funding package. House members were told late Sunday to expect votes on government funding this week, pending final passage of the funding measure in the Senate.",
      "Once a funding bill passes and the government reopens, federal workers are\u00a0entitled to back pay\u00a0under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law covers both furloughed employees and those required to work without pay, requiring agencies to issue retroactive payments as soon as possible rather than waiting for scheduled pay dates.",
      "As the shutdown stretches on, the financial toll on federal workers has deepened, with some turning to\u00a0bank loans to cover bills. About 1.4 million employees\u00a0missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",
      "The Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military personnel, said it has seen a surge in interest for its no-interest loans since the shutdown began.",
      "\"More than 350,000 members enrolled for assistance \u2014 18 times the enrollment in the 2018-19 shutdown,\" said Heather Long, the credit union's chief economist, in an email. \"It's one of many signs of how painful and uncertain this shutdown has been for many hard-working families.\"",
      "When will workers be paid?",
      "Under the 2019 law, workers who miss paychecks during a lapse in federal funding must be paid retroactively as soon as the shutdown ends. It directs agencies to issue back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "That's what happened after the 2018\u201319 shutdown, said Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.",

    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn its landmark decision on same-sex marriage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not reconsider its landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, rejecting a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn the decision.",
      "Davis, who served as the Rowan County clerk, drew national attention when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to gay and straight couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that the 14th Amendment guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.",
      "Soon after the ruling, then-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear sent a letter to all Kentucky county clerks directing them to immediately license and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. But Davis had said that affixing her name to marriage licenses for gay couples would violate her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.",
      "Kentucky later enacted a law that removed clerks' names and signatures from its marriage licenses. But until then, Davis and her deputies denied marriage licenses to several same-sex couples, including David Moore and David Ermold.",
      "The pair sought a marriage license from the Rowan County Clerk's Office 10 days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. But Davis refused to issue one, instead telling them she was acting \"under God's authority\" and advising them to go to another county for a marriage license.",
      "Moore and Ermold sued several days later, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional right to marry. They continued to return to the Rowan County Clerk's Office and were repeatedly denied a marriage license by Davis and her deputies. Moore and Ermold eventually secured a marriage license from a Rowan County deputy clerk in September 2015, when Davis was jailed for five days for refusing to issue marriage licenses in defiance of a court order.",
      "Still, the couple pursued monetary damages as a result of Davis' actions, and a jury awarded them $50,000 apiece.",
      "Davis appealed the decision, arguing that because issuing Moore and Ermold a marriage license would have violated her constitutionally protected religious beliefs, she cannot be held liable. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed, and ruled that the First Amendment does not shield Davis from liability because she was acting in her capacity as a government official.",
      "\"In their 'private lives,' government officials are of course free to express their views and live according to their faith. But when an official wields state power against private citizens, her conscience must yield to the Constitution,\" Judge Helene White wrote for the court.",
      "The 6th Circuit warned that if it were to accept Davis' argument, county clerks who find interracial marriage sinful could refuse to issue licenses to interracial couples, or a zoning official opposed to Christianity could deny a permit for construction of a church.",
      "\"[W]hen an official's discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the Constitution must win out,\" White wrote. \"The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official's conscience so dictates.\"",
      "Davis appealed to the Supreme Court. In addition to asking the justices to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, her lawyers asked them to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Her petition raised concerns that the 10-year-old decision could be at risk, particularly given the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider a number of its decisions based on the principle of substantive due process, including the right to same-sex marriage and contraception.",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and it was unclear whether four of the justices agreed that Obergefell should be reconsidered, and five would vote to overturn it.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration sent nobody to the U.N. global climate summit, leaving California Governor Gavin Newsom to ask, \"What the hell is going on here?\"",
    "story": [
      "In Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters \u2014 China, the United States and India \u2014 cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.",
      "Beijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"",
      "Two Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.",
      "\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil \u2014 one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"",
      "Ten years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "That target now appears out of reach.",
      "Based on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 \u2014 and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.",
      "Still, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards \u2014 for the very first time.\"",
      "\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"",
      "A new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.",
      "Despite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.",
      "A Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies \u2014 which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies \u2014 were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.",
      "There is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.",
      "At last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.",
      "Publicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in Mexico arrested another alleged accomplice in the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, a crime that shocked the country and remains unsolved, even though the confessed killer has been imprisoned for more than 30 years.",
      "A federal official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed Monday to The Associated Press that Jorge Antonio S\u00e1nchez Ortega was arrested in Tijuana in connection with Colosio's assassination. The official did not specify the charges against S\u00e1nchez Ortega, who is being held in a maximum-security prison in central Mexico, awaiting trial.",
      "According to the National Registry of Detentions, the arrest took place on Saturday.",
      "Colosio, the 1994 presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was shot twice during a rally in the northern Mexican city of Tijuana. Since 2024, federal prosecutors have been seeking to prosecute an intelligence agent assigned as his bodyguard, identified only as Jorge Antonio \"S,\" as the alleged perpetrator of the second shooting.",
      "As of Monday, the prosecutor's office had not officially commented on the arrest of S\u00e1nchez Ortega, and authorities have not confirmed whether new evidence has emerged.",
      "According to reports, S\u00e1nchez Ortega was employed then as an agent for the Center of Investigation and National Security - back then Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Mario Aburto has been serving a 45-year prison sentence since 1994 after declaring himself the sole perpetrator of the assassination, a confession he later retracted, claiming he was tortured.",
      "As a result of Aburto's complaints, during the administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (2019-2024) the National Human Rights Commission recommended that the federal prosecutor's office reopen the investigation.",
      "Colosio's murder triggered a major political crisis in Mexico and was always surrounded by controversy fueled by the possibility that it was encouraged by certain spheres of power, amid internal struggles within the ruling PRI to choose a successor of then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.",
      "In a January 2024 statement, the Attorney General's Office said there was evidence that the agent assigned to Colosio's security was at the scene and had clothing stained with the victim's blood. It also stated that ballistic evidence indicated that he fired a weapon - with only a difference of seconds between the two shots - and witnesses saw him flee immediately after the shooting.",
      "In the same statement, the agency considered it confirmed that the National Security and Investigation Center, which in 1994 was under the Ministry of the Interior, sent the agent to the scene of the assassination only to later \"cover for him and take him out of Tijuana urgently and surreptitiously.\" The statement concluded that the agent's immediate release was \"an evident criminal cover-up.\"",
      "Since Colosio's assassination, other politicians have been targeted by violence in Mexico.\u00a0In 2010, a front-running gubernatorial candidate, Rodolfo Torre, was assassinated in northern Mexico. Plagued by drug-related violence for decades, the country has also seen numerous local politicians murdered recently, including a mayor who was beheaded in 2024.",

      "The alleged suicide attack in Islamabad also came a day after militants stormed a military college in Wana, in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. Two militants were killed in the assault, officials said.",
      "The TTP, in statements shared with CBS News, denied involvement in both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, but Pakistani security officials and analysts said the group was likely responsible for both.",
      "Last week, a TTP source told CBS News the group considers its campaign against Pakistan's government a \"holy struggle,\" and they warned that it has \"human and technical resources in all major cities\" \u2014 and plans to stage new, large-scale attacks.",
      "The attacker tried on Tuesday to \"enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told journalists. He alleged that the attack was \"carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" linked to the TTP, but he said authorities were \"looking into all aspects\" of the explosion.",
      "Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif blamed Afghanistan's Taliban rulers for allowing the attack to take place on Tuesday. The neighbors have long had tense relations, with Islamabad accusing Afghan authorities of allowing the TTP to operate within Afghanistan's borders.",
      "\"Kabul's rulers can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but today's suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts proves this is a nationwide war,\" Asif said in a statement Tuesday. \"Anyone who believes the Pakistan Army is only fighting on the Afghan-Pakistan border and in remote Balochistan should take this attack as a wake-up call. This is a war for all of Pakistan.\"",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan held two rounds of talks aimed at addressing mutual security concerns in October and earlier this month, but both ended without any solid agreement between the neighbors, and Asif said in his statement after the Tuesday explosion in Islamabad that, \"in this environment, it would be futile to place greater hope in successful negotiations with the rulers in Kabul.\"",
      "One member of the Afghan Taliban's negotiating team told CBS News on Tuesday that the talks had failed due to Pakistan's unrealistic demands for the Taliban to restrain the TTP.",
      "\"It was far beyond our control and capacity,\" the Afghan Taliban official said, accusing Pakistan of failing to effectively counter the TTP itself.",
      "The Islamabad explosion also came a day after a large blast rocked the Red Fort, a major tourist destination in neighboring India's capital city New Delhi.",
      "That explosion killed eight people, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday that the \"conspirators\" behind the blast \"will not be spared,\" vowing that \"all those responsible will be brought to justice.\"",
      "Pakistan and India are nuclear armed neighbors that have clashed often, usually over the disputed Kashmir border region.\u00a0Dozens of people were killed in May\u00a0when India launched military strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and deep inside Pakistan, saying it was targeting militants in the country that had carried out multiple attacks on India.",

      "As if deadly snakes, spiders\u00a0and sharks\u00a0were not enough, Australia now has a new creepy critter: a \"lucifer\" bee with devil-like horns.",
      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",

      "Hamdi was in the U.S. for a speaking tour when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him at the California airport, CAIR officials said. He had entered the U.S. legally with a visitor visa on Oct. 19, but it was revoked on Friday, Oct. 24, according to ICE. He was detained at SFO on Oct. 26.

      "\"I do,\" Dietrich replied, speaking in English.",
      "The American man's relatives said he and his wife Aurelie were in conflict over the custody of their three daughters.",
      "Witnesses told investigators that Dietrich believed his wife had \"stolen\" their children after she received primary custody, according to a court document filed with an arrest warrant for Dietrich in August 2020.",
      "The children lived in France with their mother but spent Christmas and summer holidays with their father across the Atlantic.",
      "Dietrich's estranged wife and her new lover were found naked, their bodies riddled with bullets and covered in blood in the woman's bedroom. Investigators found 18 gun casings at the scene, according to the court document.",

      "The Colorado resident admitted to returning to France at the time of the crime for less than 48 hours without informing his family or daughters, who were with him in the U.S. for the summer holidays.",
      "Dietrich was arrested in August 2020. He admitted to having gone to Aurelie's place but denied having broken into her home.",
      "Confronted with photos of the bodies, he described the scene as \"savage\" and \"disgusting\" but insisted he had nothing to do with it.",
      "He accused investigators of being biased and claimed that some evidence had been falsified by the police.",
      "\"The police very much think that the law must be followed by you, the suckers, and not by them,\" he said in court.",

      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",

      "Sarkozy left La Sant\u00e9 prison by car and later quickly stepped into his home in western Paris. The brief scene was in contrast to his very public incarceration 20 days earlier, when he walked down the alley near his house hand-in-hand with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, as he waved to supporters.",
      "The former president, who denies wrongdoing, is banned from leaving the French territory and from being in touch with key people, including co-defendants and witnesses in the case, the court said.",
      "An appeals trial is expected to take place later, possibly in the spring.",
      "Sarkozy became the first former French head of state in modern times to be sent behind bars after his conviction on Sept. 25. He denies any wrongdoing. He was jailed on Oct. 21 pending appeal but immediately filed for early release.",
      "During a hearing on Monday examining his request, Sarkozy, speaking from Paris' La Sant\u00e9 prison via video conference, argued he has always met all justice requirements.",
      "\"I had never imagined I would experience prison at 70. This ordeal was imposed on me, and I lived through it. It's hard, very hard,\" he said.",
      "Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who he said helped him through \"this nightmare.\" Sarkozy's wife and two of his sons attended the hearing at the Paris courthouse.",

      "The U.S. military has killed six more people in strikes on what it claims were drug-running boats, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday, bringing the total death toll in the series of attacks to 76.",
      "Hegseth said\u00a0in a post on X\u00a0that the U.S. carried out two strikes on Sunday in international waters in the eastern Pacific, targeting two boats that were \"carrying narcotics\" with three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board each.",
      "\"All 6 were killed. No U.S. forces were harmed,\" he said.",

      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",

      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States.

      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon.

      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "In the past week Belgium's main international airport in Brussels and one of Europe's biggest cargo airports, near the Belgian city of Liege, were forced to close temporarily because of drone incursions.

The violent incident happened less than two months after\u00a014 inmates died at the same facility in what authorities described as a dispute between gangs.",
      "Local residents could hear gunfire, explosions, and cries for help coming from inside the prison's walls, AFP reported.",
      "Officials said authorities regained control of the facility following the riot, which also injured one police officer. In addition to the four inmates killed, 33 inmates and one police officer were injured.",
      "Authorities did not specify the identities of the deceased or confirm whether the violence was another case of inter-gang fighting.",
      "Ecuador's prisons have become among the deadliest in Latin America as overcrowding, corruption and weak state control have allowed gangs connected to drug traffickers in Colombia and Mexico to proliferate.

      "Britain's public broadcaster has been criticized for the way it edited a speech Mr. Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington.",
      "Portions of the speech were included in a documentary on its high-profile Panorama program and critics said they had been misleadingly edited, missing out a section where Mr. Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\"",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said, adding that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\"",
      "Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",
      "Speaking Monday morning with some of the BBC's own journalists outside her home in London, Turness repeated that she had stepped down \"because the buck stops with me. But I'd like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased. That's why it's the world's most trusted news provider.\"",
      "Asked about the White House's accusation that the BBC is corrupt, Turness said: \"Our journalists aren't corrupt and I will stand by their journalism,\" adding that she was confident the \"story will emerge\" as to how mistakes were made on coverage of topics including Mr. Trump, antisemitism and women's rights.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Mr. Trump thanked the Telegraph for \"exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.'\"",

      "Pressure on the broadcaster's top executives has been growing since Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines.",
      "As well as the edit of Mr. Trump, the dossier criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns about alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service.",

      "\"He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,\" she said in a statement on X. \"Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world.\"",
      "The BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters \u2014 and criticism from its commercial rivals \u2014 because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican Governor of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who joins us from Charleston. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country. Nearly 16% of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s. Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder are you able to get help to those who need it right now?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Absolutely, look great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. One piece of information coming out of West Virginia. We've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person. Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that, to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks. By tomorrow, that'll be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard and we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry. Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line. There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that, and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident. But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished, essentially, for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you. West Virginia won't get those dollars back?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: No, well, first of all, I want to emphasize the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: But also we've reached out, I was the first person to reach out to the federal government, so we had our national parks reopened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: And now we're working by activating the guard and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry. So we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration, and they've been very cooperative. Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- To be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- And the broader economic issues at large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts, specifically, about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70% of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election. But here's how he described the food stamp program.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP, the food program disruption, specifically?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Yeah, so we've been working closely with the White House, and I think they know they've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people. Margaret, you're right. We have 270,000 plus people on SNAP, but once again, there's one reason why --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill to keep the government open. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the concern we have. But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently, the conversations we're having about President Trump's Rural Health Transformation bill to put resources up front to save public expenditures at the back end. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I want to ask you about that. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this Rural Health Transformation Program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than a billion dollars per year because of this latest Big Beautiful Bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia that means everything because we're a very rural state.

The same goes for their relaxed yacht getaway and the candid, affectionate posts she\u2019s shared \u2014 they reflect a comfort level that\u2019s hard to fake. There\u2019s no sense of performance between them. You can see that ease in how they interact: more laughter, less posing.\"",

    "story": [
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary makes an announcement about his agency\u2019s intent to remove the \"black box\" warnings from hormone replacement therapy for menopause.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is initiating the removal of \"black box\" warning labels from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products used to ease menopause symptoms, a move Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said is backed by decades of research on the therapy\u2019s benefits and clinical trials that do not support earlier fears linking it to higher breast cancer mortality.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a press conference alongside Makary on Monday that the so-called \"black box\" labels, the strongest warnings for prescription drugs the agency can require, were designed to \"frighten women and to silence doctors.\"",
      "\"It warned of diseases and dangers that the data simply did not support. Bureaucrats at the FDA reacted out of fear, not gold standard science. And instead of correcting the record, the medical establishment doubled down in groupthink,\" said Kennedy. \"The consequences have been devastating.\"",

      "Makary added that a 2002 study known as the Women\u2019s Health Initiative \u2014 which fueled concerns about hormone therapy and breast cancer \u2014 was \"misrepresented and created a fear machine.\"",

      "He wrote in a Monday op-ed in The Wall Street Journal hours before the official announcement that HRT, which \"consists of estrogen and progesterone (or estrogen alone for women who have had a hysterectomy),\" is a \"breakthrough for many women.\"",
      "\"It alleviates the short-term symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and weight gain, and when started within 10 years of menopause it has underappreciated long-term health benefits that even doctors may not be familiar with.\"",
      "Hormone replacement therapy, used to manage menopause symptoms by supplementing hormones the body no longer produces sufficiently.",
      "The \"black box\" warnings, which were first added in 2003, were based on misinterpreted data and discouraged millions of women from using HRT, according to the FDA commissioner.",
      "NEW PROCEDURE THAT POSTPONES MENOPAUSE COULD ALSO LEAD TO LONGER FERTILITY",
      "Makary highlighted a 1991 UC San Diego review that found HRT may reduce fatal coronary events by about 50% and a 1996 study from the University of Southern California that found women using estrogen replacement therapy had a 35% lower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease compared with nonusers.",

      "In a two-year study of people with periodontitis or severe gum disease, researchers from University College London (UCL) found that those who got intensive treatment \u2014 a full-mouth deep cleaning with regular follow-ups \u2014 had slower thickening and clogging of a major neck artery and better blood-vessel function than those who only got routine cleanings.",
      "The randomized controlled trial tracked 135 adults at UCL\u2019s Eastman Dental Institute who had periodontitis, which can stem from poor oral hygiene, genetics, smoking or uncontrolled diabetes, according to the research published this month in the European Heart Journal.",

      "A new study found that deep dental cleanings could benefit heart health. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Marco Orlandi, co-author of the trial, said in a statement that the participants who received the intensive gum disease treatment had a 0.02 millimeter reduction in the thickening of their carotid arteries after two years.",
      "\"This is a significant result, as even a 0.01 millimeter reduction corresponds to a 10% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting participants reduced their risk by around 10% each year,\" Orlandi said.",
      "Doctors track the thickness of the carotid artery wall as an early warning sign for clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This study didn\u2019t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.",

      "Below are the five strategies that Attia shared with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "No. 1: Train like life is a sport",
      "Attia recommends approaching life \u2014 particularly in advanced age \u2014 like an athlete would approach a sport.",
      "As people age, their level of fitness, strength and mobility matters more than many traditional markers, he noted.",
      "7 COMMON FITNESS MISTAKES OLDER ADULTS MAKE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM FOR BETTER WORKOUTS",

      "Attia said he alternates between \"zone two\" exercise, which entails steady cardio activity that allows you to maintain a conversation, and\u00a0higher-intensity \"zone four\" training.",
      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",
      "VO\u2082 max is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).",
      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can detect cancers and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.",
      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",
      "No. 4: Prioritize emotional, mental and relational health",
      "Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia went on. \"But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.\"",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia said. \"But if we're being deliberate and active about our emotional health, it can actually improve.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",

      "No. 5: Optimize the \u2018marginal decade\u2019",
      "While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the \"marginal decade\" as enjoyable as possible.",

      "\"I spent about nine years in the Army, most of it was active duty,\" Bouchard said. \"I was an infantry officer in the 101st Airborne Division, and I did intel for the 82nd.

I got back from Iraq two weeks ago, and we're hitting the ground running.\"",

      "\"Right now, housing costs are through the roof,\" he said. \"The interest rates are too high, and people can't afford to buy the home that they want. There are a lot of things that we can do at the federal level to reduce that regulation, cut red tape and make it easier for people who are starting families to buy a house, move into the house that they want and own that home.\"",

And, at this moment, I don't feel comfortable,\" Jordan told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, it took three and a half weeks for [Beloit College] to even address the situation, and that doesn't give me much hope for how this is going to turn out for Turning Point.\"",

      "In addition to banning the alumnus from campus, the college also sent out an email, which Jordan described as \"vague\" and pointed out that it came after weeks of their complaints that fell on deaf ears, warning students about hateful rhetoric towards other students. The email did mention an incident of late that included \"the depiction of other Beloit students as dangerous radicals, Nazis, or monsters seeking to cause harm.\"",
      "\"I want to remind everyone that our Student Handbook states that social media harassment \u2026 is prohibited behavior,\" the email added. \"Engaging thoughtfully around difference is hard, but that's why you've come to Beloit: to learn to do hard things well and with compassion. So let's try this. Be kind to one another. Give the benefit of the doubt to other students.\"",

      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "\"Artificial intelligence is already replacing American workers, and experts project AI could drive unemployment up to 10 to 20% in the next five years,\" Hawley said.\u00a0\"The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around.\"",
      "Warner agreed, saying good data is key to good policy",
      "\"This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI's impact on the workforce, what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging,\" he said. \"Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Their shared goal is simple. The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make AI's workforce impact visible and accountable. It gives you and policymakers the hard data needed to guide smarter decisions about automation and employment.",
      "Challenges in tracking AI-related job impacts",
      "While the bill sounds promising, several hurdles remain. The biggest challenge is consistency. Each company decides what counts as an AI-related job impact, which could lead to uneven or incomplete reporting.",
      "Smaller businesses might also escape the rules altogether if they fall outside the reporting thresholds. That could leave big gaps in understanding how automation affects local or niche industries.",
      "Data quality is another concern. Even with reporting requirements, the system relies on companies to share accurate information. The Department of Labor will need strong verification to make sure the reports reflect reality.",
      "LIZ PEEK: AI LAYOFFS COULD SPARK A SOCIALIST SURGE IF AMERICA IGNORES THE WARNING SIGNS",
      "And while transparency is valuable, it doesn't automatically protect jobs. The law can expose the problem, but real progress will depend on what policymakers and employers do with that data.",
      "The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make companies report when automation replaces, adds or reshapes jobs. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you work in an industry where AI tools are becoming common, this bill could directly affect you. It would make it easier to see how automation changes jobs across the country. You'll be able to find out which roles are being replaced and which ones are being created.",
      "This new level of visibility could also pressure employers to be more transparent about layoffs. Companies may start explaining whether job cuts are truly due to AI or part of broader business shifts. That accountability could help workers plan smarter for the future.",
      "With clearer data, policymakers and training programs can step in faster. If large numbers of people in a certain field lose work because of automation, the government could push for retraining or job placement efforts. It may even help workers prepare earlier by learning new digital or technical skills before AI impacts their roles.",
      "SEN SANDERS: AI MUST BENEFIT EVERYONE, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES",
      "Overall, this bill puts information in the public's hands so workers can understand what's happening to their jobs instead of being left in the dark.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act marks a major step toward tracking how automation changes the American workforce. It doesn't stop AI from transforming industries, but it gives workers and policymakers the facts they need to respond. Transparency can't stop every job loss, but it can help guide smarter policies, retraining programs and career planning.",

Joe's story is a heartbreaking reminder of how easy it is to fall for an online investment scam that promises quick success and easy money.",

      "After his account access vanished, scammers allegedly demanded more cash to \"reactivate\" it. By then, Joe\u2019s retirement savings were wiped out. (Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the online investment scam began",
      "In August, Joe got a message from a company calling itself\u00a0\"ZAP Solutions.\" It promised that if he invested $30,000, he'd soon have $368,000 in returns. It sounded like a smart move. Like many victims, Joe believed the pitch because it seemed professional and legitimate.",
      "But soon he was led deeper into a trap. Each \"short-term investment\" required another wire transfer. Before he knew it, Joe had sent every penny, his 401K, IRA and other investments.",
      "When the investment scam fell apart",
      "The moment Joe was locked out of his account, panic set in. The scammers demanded more money to \"reactivate\" it. By the end, Joe had lost $228,000.",
      "His mother, Carol, was devastated when she found out.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" she said. \"He showed us the screenshots, the messages. He emptied everything.\"",

      "The bigger picture: Online investment scams are rising",

      "Staying safe starts with awareness and consistent action. Cybercriminals are getting more creative, so protecting your finances means staying alert every step of the way. Follow these proven steps to safeguard your accounts and identity.",
      "Always verify any investment opportunity before sending money. Look up the company through official government or financial websites, such as the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database or FINRA's BrokerCheck. Read reviews, confirm licenses and search for scam alerts online.",
      "If a text, email or social media message promises high returns, stop and think. Legitimate firms never cold-contact people about investment offers. Delete suspicious messages immediately and never click on links from unknown sources. Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. This can block phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and fake investment platforms designed to steal your data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Once you wire money to a scammer, recovery is nearly impossible. Never send money to someone you've only met online, even if they claim to represent a reputable company. Always confirm payment details through verified sources.",
      "Before you invest large sums, get a second opinion from a licensed financial advisor. A professional can spot red flags and unrealistic promises that you might overlook.",
      "Protect your personal information by using a data removal or privacy service that scrubs your phone number, address and other details from people search sites. This reduces the chance of scammers finding and targeting you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the Internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A new chapter in trucking has begun. Waabi, the leader in physical artificial intelligence, has revealed a major milestone in autonomous trucking, integrating the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. Together, these technologies mark a major step toward delivering an autonomous solution that is safe and supports broad commercial deployment.",

      "AI TRUCK SYSTEM MATCHES TOP HUMAN DRIVERS IN MASSIVE SAFETY SHOWDOWN WITH PERFECT SCORES",
      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The road ahead for self-driving freight looks both exciting and uncertain. The progress made by AI-powered trucks shows how far automation has come in solving real challenges like driver shortages and delivery delays. At the same time, it sparks debate about safety, employment and trust in technology. As this shift continues, clear communication and responsible testing will help the public feel more confident sharing the road with these trucks.

      "Russian state-backed hackers have stepped up their game with new malware families that hide behind fake CAPTCHA tests. The group, known as Star Blizzard or ColdRiver, now uses ClickFix attacks to trick people into launching dangerous malware disguised as a simple \"I'm not a robot\" check.",
      "These attacks represent a new wave of cyber deception, targeting governments, journalists and NGOs with malware that keeps changing faster than researchers can analyze it.",

      "The ClickFix trap: A new kind of social engineering",
      "Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) first observed the hackers using LostKeys malware in espionage operations. Once researchers exposed it, the attackers pivoted quickly, abandoning LostKeys within a week and deploying new tools: NoRobot, YesRobot and MaybeRobot.",
      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "The ClickFix attack works like this: a victim lands on a fake CAPTCHA page that looks identical to the real thing. When they click to prove they're human, the system silently runs NoRobot, infecting the computer and establishing persistence via registry changes and scheduled tasks.",
      "A fake \"I\u2019m not a robot\" CAPTCHA can launch hidden malware in seconds. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the Russian \"robot\" malware chain",
      "The Russian hackers built their latest attack around a chain of connected malware families that unfold step by step once a victim clicks the fake CAPTCHA.",
      "NoRobot acts as the first stage of infection. It prepares the environment by downloading files, modifying registry keys and creating tasks to ensure it stays active even after a reboot.",
      "The hackers briefly tested YesRobot, a Python-based backdoor, but dropped it quickly after realizing the full Python installation drew unwanted attention from defenders.",
      "3,000+ YOUTUBE VIDEOS DELIVER MALWARE DISGUISED AS FREE SOFTWARE",
      "MaybeRobot replaced YesRobot as a stealthier PowerShell-based tool. It can download and execute payloads, run command prompts, and send stolen data back to the attackers. Researchers say MaybeRobot's development has now stabilized, allowing the hackers to focus on refining NoRobot's stealth.",
      "How these attacks keep evolving",
      "Security analysts noticed the malware's delivery chain has shifted several times. At one point, it became\u00a0\"drastically simplified,\" only to grow complex again as the attackers began splitting cryptographic keys across multiple files. This strategy makes it harder for researchers to reconstruct how infections work. Without every piece of the puzzle, the final malware payload cannot be decrypted correctly.",
      "Who's being targeted by the Russian malware",
      "ColdRiver's operations have been linked to the Russian intelligence service (FSB), with years of activity focused on espionage and data theft. The group has consistently targeted Western governments, think tanks, media organizations and NGOs to steal sensitive information and gain strategic insight.",
      "Despite sanctions, infrastructure takedowns and public exposure, the hackers continue to evolve. Their quick shift from LostKeys to NoRobot and MaybeRobot shows a highly organized and well-funded operation capable of retooling within days.",

      "These practical steps can help you protect your data and devices from the growing wave of Russian malware using fake CAPTCHA pages to spread.",
      "Fake \"I'm not a robot\" pages are the main lure in this Russian malware campaign. If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",
      "Choose reputable antivirus protection that not only scans for known malware but also monitors suspicious behavior. Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "META ACCOUNT SUSPENSION SCAM HIDES FILEFIX MALWARE",
      "Many cyberattacks begin with publicly available data. Using a data removal or privacy protection service helps eliminate your personal information from data broker sites. By reducing what hackers can find online, you make it harder for them to tailor phishing emails or social engineering traps that lead to malware infection.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The malware used in these attacks exploits known security flaws in unpatched systems. Always apply updates as soon as they're released. Turn on automatic updates for your browser, antivirus and operating system. Outdated software is one of the easiest entry points for Russian hackers and other advanced groups.",
      "Cyber experts say awareness is the best defense as these evolving attacks target both organizations and everyday users. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI FLAW LEAKED GMAIL DATA BEFORE OPENAI PATCH",

      "A ransomware payload could be the next evolution of this malware family. Back up critical data to both an external drive and cloud storage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rise of these Russian malware campaigns is a reminder that cybercriminals are always one step ahead. What looks like a harmless \"I'm not a robot\" test can actually hide a serious threat. Protecting yourself isn't just about having antivirus software; it's about staying alert to small online details that can make a big difference. Keep your devices updated, question unexpected pop-ups, and use trusted tools to guard your personal information. With a little caution and consistency, you can outsmart even the most deceptive attacks.",

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency.

      "Scammers pretending to be from your bank follow a predictable yet terrifying pattern. They begin with an urgent phone call warning that your account has been compromised. The caller ID displays your bank's real number, which builds instant trust.",
      "Impostor scams have become one of the fastest-growing crimes in America, costing victims billions each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, they instruct you to move your money into a so-called \"safe\" or \"decoy\" account while they \"investigate\" the issue. Their goal is to create fear and push you into action before you have time to think.",
      "One journalist reportedly learned this lesson the hard way when he answered what appeared to be a legitimate call from Chase Bank. After a series of convincing conversations with multiple \"representatives,\" he transferred nearly $30,000 to scammers. In another case, a 65-year-old caterer reportedly lost $162,000 when a friendly woman pretending to be a bank employee claimed her ATM card had been compromised. These stories are not rare; they reflect how sophisticated and believable modern scams have become.",
      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",
      "Older adults are particularly vulnerable. The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024. These numbers highlight how no one is immune to manipulation when fear and urgency collide.",

      "9 smart tips to protect yourself from impostor scams",
      "Impostor scams move fast, but with the right precautions, you can stop them before they strike.",
      "Spoofed numbers make a call appear as if it's coming from your bank, even when it's not.",
      "Do not return calls using numbers given to you by the person who contacted you. Always call the number printed on your debit or credit card.",
      "Scammers often collect phone numbers, email addresses and other personal details from public records and data broker sites. Using a trusted data removal service helps wipe that information from the web, reducing the chances that criminals can use your data to impersonate you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Keeping your software updated adds another layer of protection against evolving scams.",

But you can fight back with knowledge and caution. Stay alert every time your phone rings or your inbox pings. Slow down before you react. Verify before you trust. The few seconds you take to double-check could be what saves your life savings. Remember, even the most tech-savvy people fall for scams when emotions take over. The real key to protection isn't fear, it's awareness and action. Share what you know with friends, family and coworkers.

      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

      "\"There\u2019s room for diversion somewhere, especially someone that has an addiction problem,\" Cooper explained. \"But what\u2019s happened is they open the gates wide. So right now everyone\u2019s taking advantage of it. A lot of criminals are. They\u2019re really abusing the system, and that\u2019s the unfortunate part about it.\"",

      "\"Under Penal Code section 1001.36, the decision to refer a defendant to mental health diversion is solely within a judge\u2019s discretion,\" the spokesperson said. \"The governor does not review individual cases and cannot determine whether repeat offenders should be admitted \u2014 that is up to the judge hearing the case.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that Newsom \"is committed to effective public safety,\" and said the purpose of the diversion law is to ensure that \"when people who commit crimes because of a mental health disorder receive necessary treatment, the public is safer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, says \"standing with Israel is in our strategic interest.\"",
      "Critics once called it isolationist. But national security experts now say Donald Trump\u2019s \"America First\" strategy is proving to be something else entirely \u2014 a hard-nosed policy of deterrence built on strong alliances, especially with Israel.",
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security and former chief of staff at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that \"The America First approach to U.S. national security means a strong national security policy, a decisive president, keeping our nation out of unnecessary wars, having members of alliances carry their own weight, but it also means standing strongly with Israel and fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "He said supporting Israel is not about sentiment. \"Standing with Israel is in our strategic interest,\" he said. \"Israel is dealing with enemies in the region that the U.S. would have to deal with if it were not there. So it\u2019s in our strategic interest.\"",
      "STATE DEPARTMENT UNVEILS PATRIOTIC 'AMERICA FIRST' REBRAND AS PART OF SWEEPING MAKEOVER",
      "President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s \"20-point peace plan\" for Gaza exemplifies the America First balance between toughness and diplomacy. \"It achieved its two primary objectives, getting all the living hostages out of Israel and enacting a ceasefire,\" he said, acknowledging that \"the ceasefire is fairly shaky.\" The next step, he added, is \"an international stabilization force\" \u2014 a complex process still under negotiation.",

The president recently designated Nigeria a Country of Particular Concern, and warned he is considering stopping aid and\u00a0introducing financial and other sanctions against government officials.",

Either the Nigerian government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\" but Pastor Fred, whose church has been attacked multiple times by Islamic militants, is firmly against any outside military action.",
      "\"I find that quite uncomfortable, as a Nigerian, imagining soldiers coming in. (I\u2019m) very uncomfortable with it, but I\u2019m more uncomfortable with the fact that people are being slaughtered, and the government is doing very little too.\"",

Yet wave after wave of radicalized Muslim Fulani\u00a0nomadic\u00a0tribesmen have mounted repeated attacks on Christians there, often decapitating children and seizing their land.",

You call the security (Nigerian authorities). If they come, they come late \u2014 after people have been killed and after homes have been burnt.\"",
      "In December 2023, the bishop said his experience was typical \"They [Fulani militants] killed 17 people. We thought it was over. While we went to do the burial, they attacked more than 25 villages in Plateau State, killing more than 100 people, including children.\"",
      "The Bishop is grateful\u00a0for\u00a0President Trump\u2019s intervention, \"the Christians here feel that this development is right.

      "The minister continued, \"Nigeria is a multi-religious nation where communities of different beliefs have coexisted for centuries.

      "As of Tuesday morning, more than 1,100 flights within the U.S. had already been canceled, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware, and more than 850 flights had been delayed. United Airlines posted a list of its canceled flights for Tuesday and Wednesday on its website. The lengthy list covers flights all day and across the entire country, starting at 6 a.m. and lasting until almost 9 p.m.",
      "The affected airports are in major cities such as Chicago, the New York area, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy will provide updates on air travel from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon.",
      "The FAA last week announced its plan to predetermine the percentage of daily flights to be canceled to accommodate air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration employees who have been working 42 days without pay. On Thursday, the cancellation reduction is supposed to increase to 8% and to 10% by Friday, according to the agency.",
      "The reduction in air travel comes even after eight Democratic senators broke with their party late Monday to pass a bipartisan bill that would end the longest-ever government shutdown. The bill, however, still needs to be passed by the House and then signed by President Donald Trump \u2014 who has indicated he supports it \u2014 for the government to return to full functionality.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump called out controllers he said were skipping work and suggested a $10,000 bonus for those who worked through the shutdown \u2014 even though he admitted he didn\u2019t know where the money would come from.",
      "These workers are considered essential and, therefore, are not allowed to walk off the job, even without a consistent paycheck. While a 2018 law ensures that those who work during a government shutdown will eventually receive back pay, airports have reported staffing shortages and delays in the last month and a half as workers grapple with the uncertainty of not knowing when they\u2019ll next be paid.",
      "Many major airlines have promised customers that they are doing everything possible to ensure they reach their destinations and are increasing flexibility to serve travelers better. But one traveler told NBC News she was on three flights \u2014 all of which got canceled.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that even if the shutdown ends by the end of the week, it may take longer for the flight system to right itself and for flight schedules to return to 100%.",
      "More than 2,400 U.S. flights were canceled Monday, with only 4% canceled as mandated by the FAA. More than 5 million air travelers have been affected by flight delays because airports lacked enough controllers to handle all the traffic, the FAA reported.",
      "Only 11 flights were canceled from Oct. 1 to Oct. 29 due to the same staffing issues, but the number of cancellations jumped to 4,162 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 9.",
      "The vast majority of those cancellations \u2014 3,756 \u2014 occurred from Nov. 7 to Nov. 9, when the FAA began mandating flight reductions at the 40 high-traffic airports.",
      "While travelers have told NBC News they are sympathetic to government employees working in airports and in the airspace, Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the strain on controllers puts the public at greater risk.",
      "\u201cThis is the erosion of the safety margin the public never sees, but America relies on every single day,\u201d Daniels said at a news conference."

    "summary": "A Utah judge rejected new congressional district lines drawn by Republican state lawmakers, instead approving a new map drawing a solidly Democratic seat with voters from Salt Lake City that's likely to flip in next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "A Utah judge late Monday night rejected new congressional district lines drawn by Republican state lawmakers, instead approving a map with a solidly Democratic seat ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "The ruling is a major blow for Republicans, who had designed a map to protect the state\u2019s all-GOP congressional delegation. And it gives Democrats a boost as they attempt to respond to Republicans\u2019 mid-decade redistricting efforts around the country and win control of the House in 2026.",
      "The court-ordered map drawn by Republican state lawmakers would have resulted in four districts that were solidly or leaning  Republican, though two would have been more competitive than the current iteration.",
      "But Utah District Court Judge Dianna Gibson tossed that map in favor of one suggested by the plaintiffs in the case. She concluded that Republicans had impermissibly considered political data and gerrymandered in favor of their own party.",
      "In its place, she chose a congressional map that includes a Democratic-leaning district anchored in northern Salt Lake County. According to court filings, it is approximately 43% Republican. Utah's current map splits the populous Salt Lake County into four districts.",
      "The ruling is the latest in a yearslong legal battle over Utah\u2019s anti-gerrymandering rules, which started long before the national redistricting arms race that has played out this year.",
      "Utah voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative in 2018 that created an independent redistricting commission that recommends congressional maps and wrote anti-gerrymandering rules into law. The GOP-controlled Legislature has worked to circumvent the changes by weakening the commission and ignoring its proposed map after the 2020 census.",
      "Advocates including the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government filed a lawsuit arguing that Republican lawmakers were gerrymandering in violation of the law. A district court agreed with the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a new map.",
      "Utah Republican Party Chair Robert Axson slammed Gibson's ruling, saying it showed the 2018 ballot measure, known as \"Prop 4,\" needs to be repealed.",
      "\"Prop 4 empowered unelected activists to overrule Utah voters and their elected representatives,\" Axson said in a statement. \"This is bigger than than maps \u2014 it is a direct threat to our constitutional order. Prop 4 created this confusion; this ruling escalates it into a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats around the country celebrated the ruling.",
      "\u201cAn enlightened Utah judge made clear last night that the people of Utah \u2014 not MAGA politicians \u2014 should decide who represents them in Congress,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeen Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \u201cThe court correctly enacted a fair map that reflects the geographical composition of Salt Lake County, instead of the current map that deliberately cracks communities of interest to artificially hand Republicans complete control of the congressional delegation.\u201d",
      "The court\u2019s overnight ruling came just before the state\u2019s election officials need to start preparing for next year\u2019s primary elections  Tuesday morning.",
      "Utah and Ohio are the only two states that are required to redraw their maps this year. But they\u2019ve had plenty of company, with Texas, Missouri and North Carolina enacting new maps to shore up the GOP\u2019s narrow U.S. House majority at President Donald Trump\u2019s urging.",
      "In response, voters in California last week approved a new map designed to net Democrats up to five House seats. And Virginia Democrats last month took the first step toward a mid-decade redistricting effort.",
      "Several Republican- and Democratic-led states are also considering redrawing their maps."

      "Her most recent film project was the 2023 sports comedy \"80 for Brady\" alongside Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Sally Field.",
      "Kirkland's off-screen pursuits were eclectic. She was an exhibited painter, a poet, an acting coach and an ordained minister in the Church of The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness (MSIA), according to her website."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Monday to review a $5 million civil judgment that found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "A jury in 2023 awarded the judgment after it found Trump liable of sexual abuse, following Carroll's allegations that Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in 1996 and later defamed her during his first term by referring to her allegations as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201ccon job.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,\u201d Trump's lawyers wrote in their filing to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cInstead, Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th president, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,\u201d the filing added.",
      "It is unclear whether the high court will take up the civil case.",
      "CNN first reported on Trump's court filing.",
      "A spokesman for Trump's outside legal team said in a statement on the filing, \u201cThe American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes.

      "The species, Megachile lucifer, was discovered by scholars surveying a critically endangered wildflower in Western Australia\u2019s Goldfields in 2019, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.",
      "The highly distinctive, upward-pointing horns on the female bee\u2019s face inspired its name, said Kit Prendergast, lead author of the study and an adjunct research fellow at Curtin University.",
      "\u201cWhen writing up the new species description[,] I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer,\u201d Prendergast said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe name just fit perfectly.\u201d",

      "Allison Mack, the \"Smallville\" star who pleaded guilty to her role in the sex trafficking case linked to NXIVM, has admitted she used her fame as a \"power tool\" in her first public comments since leaving federal prison two years ago.",
      "In a new seven-part podcast produced by CBC\u2019s Uncover, \"Allison After NXIVM,\" Mack chronicles her journey from child actor to top lieutenant in NXIVM, a purported self-help group in upstate New York led by Keither Raniere that prosecutors said was a sex-cult pyramid scheme that enslaved and branded women.",
      "Mack, 43, was sentenced in July 2021 to three years in prison for her role in the group after pleading guilty to several crimes, including extortion and forced labor. She was released early from a federal prison in California in July 2023.",
      "\"I think that I capitalized on the things I had,\" Mack said in one episode about using her celebrity to recruit women into NXIVM. \"And so the success I had as an actor, I think I did capitalize on that, yeah. And it was a power tool that I had to get people to do what I wanted.\"",
      "At Raniere\u2019s trial, former NXIVM members described how he established a secret sorority within NXIVM called DOS, in which women described as \"slaves\" were kept on near-starvation diets, branded with his and Mack\u2019s initials, and ordered to have sex with him.",
      "Mack and other leaders used nude photos and other compromising material as \"collateral\" to pressure members into complying, prosecutors said at the trial. In the podcast, Mack admits she was \u201cvery effective in moving Keith\u2019s vision forward.\u201d",
      "\"I was not kind and I was aggressive and I was abusive,\" Mack said in one episode. \"I was harsh and I was callous and I was aggressive and forceful in ways that were painful for people.\"",
      "But while Mack said in one episode that she admits she was \"abusing my power,\" she can't \"negate the fact that there was a part of me that was altruistic and was desperate to help people.\"",
      "She added that she \"wanted to be better, and I was willing to do anything to be better in myself and to help other people be better.\"",
      "Mack also describes her sentencing hearing in Brooklyn federal court, where her family sat inside the courtroom as prosecutors described her crimes. At sentencing, prosecutors said the actress deserved less prison time for her cooperation in the case against Raniere, who is serving a 120-year prison sentence on a slew of charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering.",
      "\"Oh, my God, my poor brother behind me, having to hear this about his sister,\" Mack said in one episode. \"My poor mom! I\u2019m so sorry, you guys ... I don\u2019t see myself as innocent, and they were.\"",
      "Since her release in 2023, Mack has gotten remarried and is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in social work. In one episode, host Natalie Robehmed explains that while Mack has had countless opportunities to tell her story, she has turned them all down.",
      "\"Allison has not spoken publicly since her incarceration,\" Robehmed said. \"She\u2019s had lots of offers, but always said no \u2014 until now. She wants to tell her story in podcast form, because she loves podcasts, and because she\u2019s no longer comfortable in front of cameras like she used to be.\""

      "It\u2019s not every day a new television series boasts a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the new Apple TV sci-fi drama \u201cPluribus\u201d is earning raves from critics and fans alike.",
      "The series, whose first two episodes premiered on Nov. 7, tells the story of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), a grumpy romance-fantasy author who finds herself among the dozen or so people tasked with saving the world after an alien virus puts everyone else into a happy hive mind.",
      "\u201cPluribus\u201d was created by Vince Gilligan, the mastermind behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d His new series grapples with questions about humanity, technology and contentment: If the creepy hive mind \u2014 like Aldous Huxley\u2019s fictional soma drug in the classic dystopian novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d \u2014 makes everyone happier, maybe it\u2019s OK?",
      "Seehorn, a familiar face to Gilligan fans thanks to her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d brings her comic sensibilities to Carol, whose misanthropic nature makes her an odd candidate to save humanity.",
      "Gilligan sets the series in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same setting as \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Those fascinated by UFO folklore also know the general area as the home of the 1947 Roswell Incident.",
      "Read on to hear what critics and viewers have said so far about \u201cPluribus.\u201d",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Since it debuted on Nov. 7, critics have raved about \u201cPluribus\u201d with many celebrating the continued collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn.",
      "The show currently has a critic's rating of 100%.",
      "Linda Holmes of NPR called the show a \u201cbrutal watch\u201d at times, noting how \u201cCarol finds herself deep in grief, walking through empty buildings, driving deserted neighborhoods, experiencing the arid desolation of a frictionless life.",
      "\u201cBut the collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn,\u201d Holmes continues, \u201calso is built on how funny she is, how perfectly suited to both his willingness to plumb deep wells of sadness and the playfulness.\u201d",
      "Joel Keller of Decider agreed the show\u2019s heaviness is offset by its playful tone, writing, \u201c\u2018Pluribus\u2019 is creepy and tension-filled and funny and dramatic and really weird.\u201d",
      "While several critics noted the pacing of \u201cPluribus\u201d can be slow at times, most, like Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd, promised the show ultimately delivers.",
      "\u201cAfter quickly establishing the premise, Gilligan shifts into low gear; this is a slow series, yet never a boring one,\u201d writes Lloyd, adding, \u201cGreat tracts of time pass without dialogue. For most of the way it\u2019s Seehorn\u2019s show, and she\u2019s marvelous \u2014 running through a range of emotions, confused, clever, resigned and determined by turns, as she navigates (as they say in the comics) a world she never made, an angry person beating against a sea of contentment, a complicated person in a one-speed society.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Quah of Vulture also urged viewers to stick with the series, writing, \u201cYou owe it to yourself to give \u2018Pluribus\u2019 a chance. Something glorious is gestating inside this entrancing piece of television, and to experience its full effect, you have to trust the process.\u201d",
      "Chase Hutchinson of the Seattle Times praised the series for asking challenging questions.",
      "\u201cThe more it goes on, the more \u2018Pluribus\u2019 becomes a show of immense, urgent feeling, one that grapples with the terrors of growing numb to loss. It\u2019s about survival versus resistance, compliance versus conflict, fantasy versus reality, and whether a false happiness is worth losing all of who you were for.",
      "\u201cCarol is a bit of a grump,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut she\u2019s our grump, a graceful sliver of humanity\u2019s complexity in a world that\u2019s seeking to flatten it.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes have also been mostly glowing. The show currently boasts an 84% rating from audiences at home.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan is the greatest TV writer/show runner of the Gen X cohort. The pilot is original, riveting, mysterious, funny and tragic, all at the same time. I cannot remember being so engaged in a story, at least since his last masterpiece, \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019\u201d wrote one.",
      "\u201cI was hooked from the beginning. Kept up the pace. Kept up the excitement so far threw (sic) the first 2 episodes ... The acting is superb! Finally something exciting to watch! Thank you,\u201d another agreed.",
      "Not all viewers were happy with \u201cPluribus.\u201d A handful said they were disappointed by the show and confused by all its glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cI went in knowing nothing about this show plus I\u2019m a massive sci-fi fan but I just don\u2019t understand the hype here,\u201d wrote one in part, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like people\u2019s body were taken over and forced to give 5 stars.\u201d"

      "The Season 1 finale of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d was filled with high fashion, an emotional musical performance by Maxine, as well as lies, betrayal, attempted murder and... perhaps an unexpected death?",
      "Throughout the 10 episodes, viewers saw how Chattanooga-native, former beauty pageant contestant Maxine made it her mission to infiltrate the Palm Beach high society and become one of them, despite her humble beginnings. With her husband Douglas (Josh Lucas) by her side \u2014 and his wealthy and incapacitated aunt Norma Dellacorte\u2019s funds and fashion \u2014 she almost got away with it.",

      "Norma\u2019s life story is recounted at the Beach Ball, but some things don\u2019t add up. Robert asks Axel why things didn\u2019t work out with him and Norma back in the day. Axel shares how after Norma\u2019s dad died she found her boarding school roommate dead at the bottom of the stars. \u201cAgnes was diabetic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t live long back in those days, at least not without a lot of money.\u201d",

A fun challenge for him. But, I think he totally loves her.\u201d",

It really devastated me to have to leave things like that between Maxine and Mitzi,\u201d she says, adding that Mitzi really loved Maxine in her own way.",
      "The actor and model said it \u201cbroke her heart to see these two people who we see really caring about each other and trying to lift each other up ... and you see them hurting each other.

      "Who Is the Real Norma? Who is Agnes?",

      "He points to the ninth episode where Norma tells Robert she needs \u201chelp with certain tasks, but that she expects discretion, and it\u2019s surrounding the care of her diabetes. She didn\u2019t want anybody to know that she had a weakness.\u201d Her diabetes is brought up later in the episode where Robert tells Linda that Norma is diabetic.",
      "In episode eight, he says, Axel asks Norma why she ghosted him and that she became \u201ca completely different person.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything really has for the last three episodes been leading up to this revelation that only Robert has put together because of the intimate knowledge he has of Norma and her diabetes,\u201d Sylvia explains.",
      "\u201cSo when Axl says, \u2018Yes, Agnes, she was a diabetic, they didn\u2019t live long back in those days. At least not without a lot of money.\u2019 I think Robert isn\u2019t completely sure of himself until he says \u2018Agnes\u2019 to Norma. She says, \u2018Why did you call me that?\u2019 and then, \u2018Oh my gosh, that secret might die with Robert.\u2019\u201d",
      "Sylvia noted the ironies of Norma\u2019s secret because throughout the entire season, Maxine has been trying to fit in and feels like an imposter.",
      "\u201cBut Norma is the biggest impostor of all,\u201d he says.",
      "Why Didn\u2019t Virginia Get Arrested By the Cops?",
      "Virginia finds Linda locked inside the library in her house after Mary locked her in there. As she opens the door, she gets locked inside as well. Linda asks her why she didn\u2019t get arrested along with the rest of their feminist group.",
      "Robinson tells TODAY.com that Virginia has worked very hard to be where she is.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd those friends in high places come in handy throughout the season. I can\u2019t give away too much about that. But I will say that she has connections,\u201d teased Robinson.",
      "The mystery continued with Sylvia simply adding, \u201cYou have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "However, when pressed, he teased, \u201cVirginia, just like everybody else on this show, has secrets \u2014 and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d"

Rini\u2019s launch consisted of \"everyday\" face masks in the shape of a puppy, unicorn or panda, a hydrating hydrogel facial mask and an after-sun hydrogel facial mask. The facial sheets contain ingredients like vitamin E, vitamin B12 and aloe vera.",

With safe, gentle products parents can trust, and sweet moments that bring us closer.\u201d",
      "On Rini's website, they added that they \"created Rini because we wanted products that are gentle, trust-worthy, and inspire creativity.\"",

      "In a segment that aired on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk explored the rising trend of Gen Alpha's newfound passion for skin care.",
      "Many young \"skinfluencers\" have emerged on social media and built large followings by filming videos about their skin care routines and product faves.",
      "Naiya, an 11-year-old skinfluencer on TikTok, spoke to TODAY and said she's \"learned a lot about skin care and makeup\" by filming TikTok videos.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to have a lot of fun with my mom,\u201d she said.",

      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked  Dermatologists",
      "TODAY.com spoke with two dermatologists to get their thoughts on the rising trend of child skin care. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Rini\u2019s website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids\u2019 skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \u201ceveryday\u201d mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, tells TODAY.com that kids \u201cdon\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\u201d",
      "That's because the derm says kids\u2019 skin is typically balanced on its own and \u201cnot problematic.\u201d",
      "Fahs says kids\u2019 skin \u201cneeds very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\u201d she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it\u2019s not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids\u2019 skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \u201ccreated for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\u201c and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand\u2019s product pages.",
      "Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a board-certified dermatologist, says parents don't need to rush their children into a skin care routine.",
      "\"At age 3, the only thing I think we should be considering is getting them into a little habit of being clean and just (hygienic),\" she says, adding that masks and scrubs aren't necessary for young children.",
      "Per Ingleton, children don't need to use preventative skin care products until the onset of puberty.",
      "\"Wait until there is an issue when their skin actually changes.  Then you are targeting their skin with specific products,\" she says.",
      "Fahs seconds that sentiment and advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d",
      "During a live segment on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk said the dermatologists she spoke to suggested avoiding skin care products with harsh ingredients, including retinol, fragrance and artificial dyes. They also suggested steering clear of scrubs, which can irritate skin.",
      "The dermatologists Gosk spoke to recommended seeking out products that say they're dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, calming and gentle. Ingredients like oatmeal, aloe vera and chamomile are good.",
      "\"But again, it is a conversation with your kids about what they actually need. And remember that they are going to see this stuff, so you do have to talk about it probably,\" she said."

      "Who Was John Wayne Gacy?",
      "Born in 1942 in Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was a building contractor who also dressed as \"Pogo the Clown\" for children's parties.",
      "According to History.com, he had a relatively normal middle-class upbringing, though there were accounts that he had an abusive alcoholic father. He got married in 1964 to Marlynn Myers, whose father owned a couple of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Waterloo, Iowa. As seen in \"Devil in Disguise,\" Gacy managed one of the restaurants. He was later charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting one of his male employees in 1968. He was released early due to good behavior.",
      "Gacy and Myers had two children together, Michael and Christine, before they divorced following his charges.",
      "After his release, he moved back to Chicago and remarried Carole Hoff. Once there, he started his construction business and clown work.",
      "What Did John Wayne Gacy Do?",
      "From 1972 to 1978, Gacy lured young men and boys, oftentimes for sex before murdering them and burying them in his home's crawl space.",
      "His murders would go undetected for years until December 1978 when police started investigating the disappearance of 15-year-old teenager named Robert Piest.",
      "How Did John Wayne Gacy Get Caught?",
      "Robert Piest was last seen with Gacy. \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d shows how he would lure young men with hopes of a construction job, taking him to his home before he killed them.",
      "Piest went missing on his mother Elizabeth Piest's birthday, when he never returned home for dinner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Elizabeth, which is good for the Piest family, which I think really valued their privacy,\u201d Ireland tells TODAY.com about portraying the victim\u2019s mother. \u201cFor me, I focused on just telling a story of a woman who was going through this very sudden and intense grief.\u201d",
      "Police began to look into Gacy after learning of his prior conviction. After obtaining a search warrant for his Norwood Park home, they discovered a foul smell and items from other missing men.",
      "According to NBC Chicago, Gacy's then-lawyer Sam Amirante shared in his book \u201cJohn Wayne Gacy: Defending a Monster,\u201d that Gacy confessed to him that Robert Piest was dead and \u201che\u2019s in the Des Plaines River.\u201d",
      "Gacy would go on to detail each of his murders and where he buried or dumped the bodies.",
      "\u201cHe went on, murder by murder, piece by piece, burial by burial,\u201d Amirante wrote. \u201cHe wanted to prove that what he was saying was true. He wanted to take us to his house and show us the burial ground.\u201d",
      "In 1979, Gacy was arrested in Cook County, Illinois. Police continued to find bodies in Gacy's home, as well as the river where he said he disposed of the victims.",
      "What Happened to John Wayne Gacy?",
      "In March of 1980, Gacy was convicted of murdering 33 young men, who ranged from 14 to 21. He was sentenced to death and transferred to death row in the then-new downstate Menard Correctional Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "More victims continued to be identified as the months and years went by. In 1985, an appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding Gacy's death sentence.",
      "Gacy was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center in 1994.",
      "Five of his victims recovered from his residence remain unidentified. According to the Cooks County Sheriff\u2019s Department, officials tested the remains using the latest technology and DNA profiles suitable for comparison have been obtained.",
      "\u201cI really hope that (with this show) we can start to talk about changing the narrative around dehumanizing people who aren\u2019t like ourselves,\u201d Chernus says. \u201cI really think we are trying to, in a way, address the systemic biases that allowed Gacy to get away with this for so long. And there are still unidentified victims that I hope, in some way, maybe this show allows someone to call in a tip.\u201d",
      "The PD stated that after Gacy\u2019s arrest, they learned that some of his victims were never reported missing by their families. At the time, many were estranged from the victims or were unaware that they were missing.",
      "The department is still accepting information from people who believe their friends or family members might have been one of Gacy\u2019s victims."

      "Viewers of \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d Season 2 are in for a tumultuous ride in the German teen drama\u2019s sophomore outing \u2014 if the opening shots of a crashed car are any indication.",
      "\u201cI just had a worst time on set,\u201d Damian Hardung, who stars as tortured rich bad boy James Beaufort, says. \u201cI\u2019m laughing now. I was crying then.\u201d",
      "Season 2 officially dropped on Prime Video Nov. 7 with the first three episodes, each clocking in around one hour. Like Season 1, it will have six episodes, with one new episode dropping each week until Nov. 28.",
      "Season 2 picks up right where last season left off. Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten) is confident she and James had reconciled their relationship after he called it off due to a threat from his dad. Meanwhile, James is reeling from the death of his mother, Cordelia.",
      "In the final moments of Season 1, a bereft James stumbled to Ruby\u2019s house. As he peered into her kitchen window, he saw a smiling Ruby surrounded by her parents and sister. But when Ruby looked up, he was gone.",
      "\u201cI love that shot of me looking in and just deciding that I don\u2019t want to destroy her life because I know what my family entails,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "The first episode of Season 2 alone sets the stage for plenty of heartbreak \u2014 so much so that star Herbig-Matten says she had to learn how to separate herself from her character after shooting.",
      "\u201cWhen we shot Season 1, I was 18. ... I think in Season 2 I achieved to separate her emotions from mine, and that was really healthy for me,\u201d Herbig-Matten says. \u201cI know I\u2019m safe, and when we had really intense and emotional scenes, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my life and it\u2019s not hurting me.\u201d",
      "Below, Hardung and Herbig-Matten break down the first few episodes of Season 2 \u2014 including a shocking betrayal \u2014 and set the stage for what\u2019s ahead.",
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Spoilers ahead for the first three episodes of \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d Season 2.",
      "Why Does James Cheat on Ruby?",
      "People who\u2019ve read Mona Kasten\u2019s \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d book series \u2014 the first of which was published in English July 1 \u2014 won\u2019t be surprised by Episode 1\u2019s big twist.",
      "\u201cEveryone who read the book knows that originally, the kiss with Elaine was at the end of the first book,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "After the death of his mother, and after he decides not to confide in Ruby, James temporarily goes missing. His twin sister, Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), also starts looking for James. They eventually find him drunk, mid-bender at a raging pool party. Ruby watches his out of control partying in horror. After telling Ruby she doesn\u2019t belong there, he kisses his old flame Elaine in the pool right in front of her.",
      "Ruby walks home alone from the party inconsolable.",
      "The next morning, James wakes up dazed, confused and horrified at what happened.",
      "Hardung describes the kiss as part of a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d depiction of James\u2019 grief. His character tries to push away Ruby because he knows the public spectacle his family brings, especially in the wake of his mother\u2019s death, Hardung says.",
      "In addition to self-isolation and drinking, James also turns to drugs. As his father announces Cordelia\u2019s death at a press conference outside their house, James is inside, using cocaine.",
      "\u201cWe took the time to truly acknowledge his period of grief and to tackle the loss, and I think we were brutally honest about it,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "\u201cI just hope fans are willing to go on that suffering journey with him,\u201d he adds. \u201cI feel like that was my main goal, to make them root for him or feel for him even though he is so inherently flawed and even though he f---- so badly \u2014 to still make people understand that this is the best that he can do at that certain time.\u201d",
      "Why Does Ruby Go Back to James?",
      "So to recap: Less than 15 minutes into Season 2, Ruby and James\u2019 relationship is again on the rocks. But this is \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d after all.",
      "When Ruby witnesses James cheat on her, she doesn\u2019t yet know about his mother\u2019s death. The next morning, still reeling from the kiss and the mounting pressure of a scholarship opportunity, her best friend tells her Cordelia Beaufort had died.",
      "Without hesitating, she goes to the Beaufort mansion to attempt to comfort James.",
      "\u201cI think Ruby has a really good heart, and I think when she loves someone, she loves them deeply, and she gives them everything,\u201d Herbig-Matten says of her character\u2019s decision to go to James\u2019 side. \u201cI think that was no question because she just want to show him that she\u2019s thinking about him and to show her presence, and also to be there for Lydia. I think that was also really important for her.\u201d",
      "Ruby finds James on the bathroom floor. His eyes well as she holds him. Through tears he says he regrets being mean to Cordelia the last time he saw her. He eventually falls asleep in Ruby\u2019s lap.",
      "But after Ruby checks his phone and sees a video message from Elaine from the night before, Ruby starts to withdraw. James tries to apologize and says Elaine means nothing to him. He begs her to stay, but when Ruby tells him he needs help, he shouts for her to leave.",
      "Hardung says he and Herbig-Matten were \u201creally afraid\u201d of this scene specifically.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the the shooting schedule, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, s--- it\u2019s coming up in two weeks,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "In this scene, Hardung says his character is lying to himself.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a scene objective really clearly \u2014 it\u2019s almost written on my head, \u2018I need you to stay. I need you to love me.\u2019 And then it breaks into, \u2018I need you to leave.\u2019 Out of a fear that I\u2019m not going to achieve my goal, and I can\u2019t stand failing again because I fail so much. So I\u2019d rather change my goal and lie to myself than to fail miserably again,\u201d he says of James.",
      "After James\u2019 mom\u2019s funeral at the end of the first episode, he hijacks a car and goes on a rampage. He tries to call Ruby, and when she doesn\u2019t answer, his driving gets more and more out of control until he spins out and flips the vehicle.",
      "In Episode 2, once he\u2019s released from the hospital, James again apologizes to Ruby and says he wants to fight for her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t save you, James, only you can,\u201d she finally says, a callback to the name of the second book in the series.",
      "This line sets the stage for Season 2\u2019s overall theme of \u201chealing,\u201d Herbig-Matten says.",
      "\u201cSeason 2 for me is about growth and about healing. And healing means sometimes to fall apart and to get yourself together again and to let people go,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned and what people can learn, and we see that she has to let him go and to heal himself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Readers have been upset to learn that the Farmers' Almanac is ceasing publication after more than 200 years in existence.",
      "No, not that one.",
      "The Nov. 6 announcement by the staff at the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac not only caused an outpouring of support for a publication that began in 1818, but also resulted in a competing farmer's almanac putting out a statement that it is still very much in business.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac, based in New Hampshire, issued a news release on Nov. 7 clearing up any confusion by noting that it is \"still going strong.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Why Is the Farmers' Almanac Shutting Down?",
      "The Farmers' Almanac, based in Lewiston, Me., announced that it is ceasing publication due to the \"growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment,\" the company said in a news release.",
      "Access to existing digital content on its website will be discontinued in December.",
      "\"First we want to tell everyone that this decision was very hard to make,\" Farmers' Almanac editor Sandi Duncan told TODAY.com in an email. \"The Almanac has been published each and every year since 1818 \u2014 even when the editor (Ray Geiger) was overseas serving in World War II. And we also recognize that it\u2019s more than just a book \u2014 it\u2019s a way of life \u2014 a tradition \u2014 a resource for so many people for so many years.\"",
      "\"However, readers now access information and answers differently, and the trajectory of newsstand sales made this decision necessary,\" she continued. \"The financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment, unfortunately lead to this decision.\"",
      "The 2026 Farmers' Almanac will be the final edition of a publication that began in 1818. It features weather forecasts, astronomy tidbits and predictions like the best days to ski, brew beer, plant tomatoes and view meteor showers.",
      "Duncan, who has worked at the publication since 1994, spoke about what she hopes the legacy of the long-running publication will end up being.",
      "\"To remind people to stop and smell the roses,\" she said. \"To appreciate all the wonders of nature, to realize that there is so much we can learn from the natural world even if we live among concrete skyscrapers.\"",
      "The announcement left readers upset at the loss.",
      "\"Sadly another treasured memory will disappear but will never be forgotten,\" one person commented on the Farmers' Almanac website. \"Have read FA since I was a kid, now 70.\"",
      "\"No way! Please tell me it isn\u2019t so,\" another wrote. \"I have had the FA in my home every year since I was 19 years old. I am now in my 70\u2019s. The wit, wisdom, and weather have been like a wonderful old friend to me.\"",
      "\"Please don\u2019t go. I\u2019ve grown up with you and want to keep growing older together,\" another commented. \"Not ready for you to leave. Please reconsider.\"",
      "What Is the Difference Between the Farmer\u2019s Almanac And the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac?",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac is based in Dublin, N.H., and has been in existence since 1792.",
      "The Farmer's Almanac is based in Lewiston, Me., and was in existence since 1818.",
      "The editors of the Old Farmer's Almanac released a statement on Nov. 7 in case readers were confused thinking it was going out of business.",
      "\"You may have heard that the Farmers' Almanac, based out of Lewiston, ME, is ceasing publication after an incredible 200+ year run,\" the statement reads. \"Over the years, there has been some confusion between different almanacs, so to be clear: The OLD Farmer\u2019s Almanac isn\u2019t going anywhere. As we have since 1792, during George Washington\u2019s presidency, we will continue to publish our annual edition, while educating and entertaining readers online at Almanac.com.\"",
      "The 2026 Old Farmer's Almanac will feature new gardening books, digital tools, calculators and seasonal weather forecasts. The book also includes gardening knowledge, astronomy and folklore material.",
      "\"Rest assured, as sure as the Sun will rise, The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac \u2014 with our familiar yellow cover and 80% accurate weather forecasts \u2014 will be around for generations to come,\" the statement concluded."

    "story": [
      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

      "Carroll, a 37-year-old Virginia middle school teacher, is in the upper echelon of the fandom and her recent viral TikTok post showed just how much the long-running procedural drama means to her.",

She knew exactly what it was when I said it, which just goes to show how many fans there are out there.\u201d",
      "In just 10 minutes, a tribute to \u201cSVU\u201d was permanently etched into her skin. She later showed the ink to friends and family, who she says were amused. The vice principal at her school playfully rolled her eyes and shook her head when she saw it.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go places with this tattoo.\u2019 And look who I\u2019m talking to!\u201d (Her students were especially excited when the video climbed to 6.7 million views, thanks to the term \u201c67\u201d flooding TikTok.)",
      "Carroll was shocked by the response on social media, with the video reaching 1 million views in just one day. \u201cI was like, I guess I found my people,\u201d she says about the TikTok going viral. \u201cAll the comments were amazing. I was so happy to see that it was mostly positive.\u201d There were some critics, but she adds that many fans were impressed and laughed at the inside joke.",
      "Although the tattoo is a funny way to express her love for \u201cSVU,\u201d Carroll shares that she has a heavier connection to the ink and the series.",
      "\u201cI think another reason that this show really resonates with me is because one in four women has been sexually assaulted,\u201d she says, a statistic confirmed by an article published on the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website. \u201cMyself included.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a weightlifter. I\u2019m not necessarily a small person. I\u2019m 6 foot 1 and I never thought that it would happen to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cI always thought that if I was in that position, I would fight back, or I would put them in their place. And I froze. Olivia\u2019s character tells people that all the time on the show.\u201d",
      "Carroll became emotional while explaining how Olivia\u2019s repeated message that sexual assault victims are not at fault has helped her.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that people are gonna people, and all we can do is survive. Like she tells a lot of the victims on the show, the whole point was that you got out of it. You made it through to the other side. It\u2019s just an unfortunate but good connection to have with that character.\u201d",
      "She also applauds Hargitay for using her platform to speak about sexual assault, particularly the rape kit backlog.",
      "\u201cThis is real life,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cThese are real (stories). Obviously, you know the little disclaimer in the beginning, but it\u2019s still real situations. These are real events that women, especially, have to go through.\u201d"

      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",

It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",

      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "Under international pressure, the RSF said Thursday that it was willing to engage in a U.S.-brokered humanitarian ceasefire. But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",

    "summary": "Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The Oval Office is a long way from Abu Ghraib.",
      "When he was greeted by President Donald Trump on Monday, Ahmad al-Sharaa completed his journey from jihadist leader to head of state receiving a warm White House welcome.",
      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."

    "story": [
      "A cyberattack against British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the country\u2019s largest automaker, has been so catastrophic that it put a dent in the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, the Bank of England said.",
      "In its quarterly monetary policy report, released Thursday, the Bank of England said headline GDP had grown by 0.2%, less than it had projected. That slowdown was due to reduced exports to the U.S. and \u201cdisruption linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack,\u201d it said.",
      "The hack against Jaguar Land Rover, which began in August, has proven to be the most economically devastating in British history, said Ciaran Martin, the chair of the technical committee at Cyber Monitoring Centre, a nonprofit that tracks the impacts of cyberattacks on the country.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including declines in vaccination rates. The most significant factor is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada\u2019s outbreak started in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Monday, Canada\u2019s health officials had tallied 5,138 measles cases since the outbreak began. Two babies, infected in utero, were born pre-term and died.",
      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",

      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",

      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",

      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",

      "The official award Monday drew outrage from rights activists who accuse the country\u2019s current leader, President Prabowo Subianto, of whitewashing his former father-in-law\u2019s legacy.",
      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The annual award is given to those who have contributed significantly to the development of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago and former Dutch colony that declared independence in 1945.",
      "\u201cA prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,\u201d an announcer said as Prabowo gave the award to Suharto\u2019s daughter and son.",
      "Suharto, a military officer, became president in 1967 after seizing power from Indonesia\u2019s first president and independence leader, Sukarno, who was viewed as pro-communist by Western governments.",
      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",
      "\u201cThere has for some time been a tendency in official circles to rehabilitate Suharto\u201d and to see his regime \u201cin a progressively more positive light,\u201d he said.",
      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",

      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",

    "story": [
      "NEW DELHI \u2014 When the weight loss drug Mounjaro came on the market in India earlier this year, Shyamanthak Kiran was one of the first patients to try it.",
      "Kiran, a 27-year-old financial trader who has struggled with hypothyroidism, said he \u201cdid not have a lot of expectations\u201d when it came to losing weight. But \u201cluck turned out in my favor,\u201d he said, and in six months he lost all of the 60-plus pounds he had gained a few years earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was a two-year struggle that came to an end, and I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro, which is also used to treat diabetes in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
      "The injectable medication from American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has become India\u2019s most popular drug by value since being approved in March, with over $11 million in sales in October, pharmaceutical market research firm Pharmarack said Friday.",
      "Even before India\u2019s more recent approval of Ozempic, another drug that is widely used for weight loss in the United States and other countries, there was already surging demand in the country for semaglutide, its active ingredient.",
      "Ozempic\u2019s Danish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, says it is \u201cactively working\u201d to widen the availability of the drug, which Indian regulators have approved for diabetes but not obesity. The company also makes other semaglutide drugs that are already used for weight loss in India, including Wegovy, an injectable, and Rybelsus, which is taken orally.",
      "Demand could grow even further when the patent for Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, expires next March in India, a pharmaceutical manufacturing giant where companies are eager to produce cheaper generic versions of the lucrative weight-loss drugs.",
      "The exploding popularity of the drugs has taken aback some doctors and officials, with Jitendra Singh, a government minister and physician, warning in August against the \u201cunchecked spread of disinformation\u201d through \u201cfad regimens\u201d and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions such as regular yoga practice.",
      "Semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, are GLP-1 agonists that were first developed to treat diabetes and have also been approved in many countries for the treatment of obesity. They regulate blood sugar and help slow how quickly food passes through the stomach, curbing hunger as a result.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has over 100 million people with diabetes, or nearly 10% of its adult population, according to a 2023 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research. An additional 135 million people are prediabetic, the study found.",
      "Doctors say the situation is worsening as India\u2019s burgeoning middle class adopts a more Western lifestyle, eating more high-fat, high-sugar foods and exercising less.",
      "\u201cCompared to, say, a decade ago, there are more people now in their late 20s and early 30s who are being diagnosed with diabetes, as compared to the elderly population,\u201d said Dr. Saurav Shishir Agrawal, an endocrinologist in Noida, which is part of Delhi\u2019s capital region.",
      "\u201cThey ask us to just give them pills,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut these medicines work better only when you are clubbing them with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "Agrawal practices at the newly built Medanta Hospital, where staff greet patients with a gentle \u201cNamaste.\u201d It is an example of the growing number of modern and high-end hospitals popping up around increasingly dense megacities such as Delhi, home to 33 million people, where diabetes has a greater hold.",
      "A monthly course of Mounjaro can cost as much as $250, the average monthly salary in many parts of India. But for more affluent Indians, a bigger deterrent is the idea of injecting themselves, said Dr. Tribhuvan Gulati, an endocrinologist.",
      "\u201cPeople get scared whenever you tell them that they\u2019re going to be on an injectable,\u201d said Gulati, who has a clinic in central Delhi.",
      "Gulati keeps a demo pen of Mounjaro in a drawer to show how easy it is to use the medicine, which just needs to be refrigerated before use.",
      "But the ease of use is also what worries Gulati and other doctors, who say many patients fail to overhaul the lifestyle and dietary habits causing or contributing to their health issues in the first place.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the causes of obesity in India, it is 90% lifestyle and 10% anything else,\u201d said Dr. Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol and head of India\u2019s National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe diet now is totally imbalanced because of free availability of food everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "The potential gastrointestinal and other side effects from the weight-loss drugs, which in the U.S. have prompted multiple lawsuits against GLP-1 makers, give some patients pause, Gulati said. But others \u201care OK with continuing it throughout their life because they know that they won\u2019t be able to control themselves.\u201d",
      "Diabetic patients such as Moinak Pal, who has high insulin resistance, say that GLP-1 drugs have been the easiest way to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI have been fat-shamed since I was a child,\u201d said Pal, 34, a Noida-based journalist. He said he has been losing about 3 pounds a week since he started taking Mounjaro.",
      "It was \u201cextremely difficult for me to lose weight by conventional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the problem, Misra said, is the lifestyle in India\u2019s sprawling and congested urban areas, where commutes can last as long as four hours round-trip. When workers get home, apps can deliver everything from food to clothes to their doorsteps in minutes.",
      "\u201cThey want quick fixes that don\u2019t involve going on a restrictive diet or daily exercise of an hour and so on,\u201d he said of some of his patients. \u201cAs a result, diabetes is everywhere. Every day I see patients who are young, who have uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Rajendra Nath Dixit blames nobody but himself for his health problems. The retired banker had heart bypass surgery earlier this year, and before that had been spending almost 8,000 rupees ($90) a month just on his insulin.",
      "\u201cI was fond of taking the typical Indian oily foods, samosas, chole bhature, and in the evening I would take five or six rotis,\u201d said Dixit, 66. \u201cEvery bad habit was there.\u201d",
      "In the five months since his surgery, Dixit has switched over completely to the oral semaglutide Rybelsus, is exercising more and is consuming less fat and sugar. He is spending 11,000 rupees ($125) a month on Rybelsus, but has been able to stop using insulin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling very good, very light,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence has gone up, and my life has totally changed.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier has entered service, Chinese state media said Friday, in a major step for the world\u2019s largest navy as it seeks to challenge U.S. dominance in the Pacific.",
      "The Fujian is China\u2019s third aircraft carrier but the first to be both designed and built domestically. It features an electromagnetic catapult system that allows for aircraft launches with heavier payloads compared with existing launch systems, according to CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping presided over the carrier\u2019s commissioning on Wednesday at a military port on the island of Hainan in a ceremony attended by over 2,000 naval officers and construction personnel, CCTV said.",
      "Both of China\u2019s previous aircraft carriers used a ski-jump type system, which is unable to handle fighter jets carrying heavier loads or large support aircraft. Its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was made by the Soviet Union while its second, the Shandong, was built in China based on the Soviet model.",
      "The Fujian\u2019s three electromagnetic catapult positions \u201cwere particularly noticeable\u201d along the flight deck, the CCTV report said, which also featured China\u2019s new carrier-based jets: the stealth-fighter J-35, the heavy-fighter J-15T, and the early-warning aircraft KJ-600.",
      "Though the Chinese navy is the world\u2019s largest, the U.S. navy, with its 11 aircraft carriers, is still considered the most advanced.",
      "Under Xi, China\u2019s navy has undergone rapid modernization with the goal of being able to go head-to-head against America\u2019s. China has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "Experts say the Fujian and the other two carriers could be crucial assets in the event of conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "China\u2019s neighbors are closely watching its military developments.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the aim of the Chinese military is to enhance its operational capabilities in distant waters and airspace through the strengthening of their naval forces,\u201d Minoru Kihara, Japan\u2019s top government spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo on Friday.",
      "He said China was \u201cexpanding its military capabilities extensively and rapidly, without sufficient transparency,\u201d adding that Japan was monitoring Chinese military activity in the area and would \u201crespond calmly but also resolutely\u201d if necessary.",
      "The commissioning of the Fujian comes two months after China held a massive military parade in Beijing that showcased its most advanced weapons.",
      "The Fujian, which was launched in 2022 and began sea trials in May 2024, is only the second aircraft carrier in the world to use an electromagnetic catapult system after the latest American carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Most American carriers use older steam catapult technology that China has bypassed.",
      "But the Fujian lags behind in one key area: nuclear power.",
      "All American carriers are nuclear-powered, meaning they have virtually unlimited range, while the Fujian, which is the world\u2019s largest conventionally powered warship, is estimated to have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles.",
      "That could change, however, as China may be developing a nuclear-powered supercarrier, NBC News reported in March.",
      "All three Chinese aircraft carriers \u2014 the Liaoning, the Shandong and the Fujian \u2014 are named after coastal provinces."

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry has apologized to Canada after wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers cap at a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "Harry and his wife, Meghan, were seen in the front row at Game 4 of the series, both sporting bright blue Dodgers headwear. The choice caused some consternation in Canada, a commonwealth country that the couple had called home and whose head of state is Harry\u2019s father, King Charles III.",
      "\u201cFirstly, I would like to apologize to Canada for wearing it,\u201d the Duke of Sussex told Canadian broadcaster CTV on Thursday. \u201cSecondly, I was under duress. There wasn\u2019t much choice,\u201d he joked.",
      "Harry said that wearing the cap felt like \u201cthe polite thing to do\u201d after he was invited to the game by the team\u2019s owner.",
      "He later switched to a Blue Jays cap for the rest of the series, showing belated support for the only Canadian team in Major League Baseball.",
      "The Blue Jays ultimately lost the series to the defending champion Dodgers in a dramatic Game 7.",
      "Explaining his initial choice of headwear, Harry said that \u201cwhen you\u2019re missing a lot of hair on top, and you\u2019re sitting under flood lights, you\u2019ll take any hat that\u2019s available.\u201d",
      "Harry, who is visiting Canada for Remembrance Week events, was given a Blue Jays hat while meeting with the nation\u2019s oldest veterans on Thursday.",
      "Wearing it in the interview with CTV, he said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d at Toronto's defeat.",
      "\u201cGame 5, Game 6, Game 7, I was Blue Jays throughout. Now that I\u2019ve admitted that, it\u2019s going to be pretty hard for me to return back to Los Angeles,\u201d he added.",
      "After leaving their royal lives behind, Harry and Meghan now live in Montecito with their children Archie, 6, and Lilibet, 4.",
      "Meghan resided in Toronto while filming the TV drama Suits and spent time there with Harry in the early days of their relationship, before the couple moved to Los Angeles in 2020.",
      "Meghan has previously showed support for the Blue Jays herself."

      "A paramilitary group accused of killing thousands of Sudanese civilians in a war that has triggered a catastrophic humanitarian crisis said Thursday it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal from U.S.-led mediators, although an American official indicated a final deal had not been struck yet.",
      "Hours after the announcement, a State Department spokesperson indicated the U.S. was still working to get both sides \u2014 the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese military \u2014 to agree a truce.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage directly with the RSF and SAF to facilitate a humanitarian truce,\" the spokesperson said, referring to the Sudanese Armed Forces. \"We urge both sides to move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce.\"",
      "The RSF, which has been widely accused of carrying out atrocities during 18 months of fighting, earlier said in a statement that it had accepted the truce \u201cin order to address the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the war and to enhance the protection of civilians.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire would \"ensure the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Sudanese people,\" the group added about the proposal put forward by a mediator group known as the Quad and made up of the U.S., Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "An official from the Sudanese military, which the RSF has been fighting for control and has also been accused of widespread atrocities, told The Associated Press that the army would only agree to a truce that includes the RSF withdrawing from civilian areas and giving up weapons.",
      "The RSF seized control of the city of el-Fasher, the army's last stronghold in the western Darfur region, over a week ago. Civilians fleeing the area and satellite imagery suggest the militia carried out mass killings of those who remained.",
      "The war that erupted in April 2023 has forced more than 14 million people from their homes and fueled disease outbreaks. Two regions of Sudan are enduring a famine that\u2019s at risk of spreading, according to the United Nations.",
      "More than 40,000 people have been killed in the war, according to United Nations figures, although aid groups say the true death toll is likely many times higher.",
      "The RSF said it was looking forward \"to implementing the agreement and immediately commencing discussions on the arrangements for a cessation of hostilities.\"",
      "Fighting has raged in Sudan since the military, controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, then partners in power, clashed over plans to integrate their forces.",
      "Burhan and his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti who leads the RSF \u2014 were leaders of a 2019 counterinsurgency that led to the ouster of longtime President Omar al-Bashir.",
      "Two years later, they agreed to rule together after a coup that brought down the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.",
      "But their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government, and, with neither seemingly willing to cede power, the war broke out.",
      "The United States determined in January that RSF members and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan and imposed sanctions on Dagalo. It had previously sanctioned other leaders, as well as army officials.",
      "There was widespread outrage last week after RSF forces entered the city of el-Fasher which it had besieged for 18 months, cutting off most food and other supplies needed by the population of tens of thousands of people.",
      "One eyewitness told NBC News they had witnessed RSF fighters slaughtering people and running them over with trucks. Some of the fighters also recorded themselves shooting people in the street.",
      "Such was slaughter that blood could be seen in sand next to piles of bodies in satellite images from space, according to the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health."
