      "Bands behaving badly",
      "Bands behaving badly? It's only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

    "story": [
      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda is using the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of *Hamilton* to support nonprofits providing immigration services",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d Rihanna has \u201cSmurfs.\u201d Now, we patiently await a \u201cGummi Bears\u201d with the Biebs.",
      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",

      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",
      "Bookstores like Lovestruck and The Ripped Bodice (which has a flagship store in Los Angeles) have begun popping up all over the U.S., from Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, North Carolina, to Hopkinsville, Kentucky.",
      "Of the 157 romance-dedicated bookstores in the American Booksellers Association, more than half opened within the last two years, said Allison Hill, CEO of the trade group for independent sellers.",
      "\u201cRomance books have been one of the fastest growing book sales categories in recent years, driven by a number of factors including the need for escape reading and BookTok,\u201d Hill said.",
      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",
      "As with many hobbies, romance fandom solidified and expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",
      "\u201cIt is pleasurable to reimagine courtship or the romantic bond,\u201d said Jayashree Kamble, professor of English at LaGuardia Community College and president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance. \u201cThere is limited risk involved.\u201d",
      "Kamble has been a voracious romance reader since her teenage years in India, where she devoured Harlequin romances.",
      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",
      "\u201cI can go to a bookstore and not just find people who love books,\u201d she said, \u201cbut find people who love the very same books I love.\u201d",
      "As Annabel Monaghan, author of several love stories including \u201cNora Goes Off Script,\u201d puts it, \u201cPeople who read romance want to feel good. And when you gather a bunch of people who want to feel good, it\u2019s magic.\u201d",

      "In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",

      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",
      "If alternatives pan out, \u201cI absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",

      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",
      "\u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, what they are putting down will not be funding in the same way that the American resources were funding,\" Byanyima said.",

      "Brazil\u2019s lower house has passed a controversial bill that overhauls environmental legislation",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A bill to overhaul environmental regulations in Brazil was passed by the country's lower house Thursday, drawing criticism by the environmental minister who floated the possibility of a presidential veto.",
      "With the bill already passed by the Senate in May, it now goes to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who casts himself as an environmental defender and later this year will preside over the first U.N. climate talks, known as COP30, to take place in the Amazon. Lula can sanction the project, veto it in its entirety or veto only certain aspects.",
      "Lula has not publicly comment on what action he might take.",
      "If signed by Lula, the sweeping legislation will weaken federal agencies\u2019 environmental licensing powers. Among other measures, it speeds up review for projects deemed priorities by the federal government, reducing the approval process from three bureaucratic steps to one. It also eliminates reviews for upgrades to existing highways, which could clear the way for to pave the whole of a highway that runs about 900 kilometers (560 miles) through the western part of the Amazon. Environmentalists argue that the project will lead to mass clearing of a pristine area of rainforest.",
      "The bill\u2019s approval is a victory for supporters who argued Brazil\u2019s current regulations needs to be simplified, but a blow for environmental experts and green activists, who refer to it as the \u201cdevastation bill.\u201d The bill passed with a strong majority, 267 votes to 116.",
      "After the bill passed, Environment Minister Marina Silva told local press that the bill undermined environmental legislation and that the federal government would still seek alternatives, including the possibility of a presidential veto.",
      "A campaign in the lead up to the vote said the bill could lead to a regression in pollution control - risking health issues - increase water contamination and scarcity, increase deforestation and undermine protected areas.",
      "At the heart of concerns is the proposal to install a self-declaration process for environmental licensing, which Suely Ara\u00fajo, the public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory network of NGOs, said would cover around 90% of total projects in Brazil.",
      "Companies would \u201cfile a description online, press a button, and the license will be issued,\u201d she said, calling the proposal \u201cby far the worst piece of legislation\u201d ever from an environmental standpoint.",
      "Last week, more than 300 nonprofits, including Greenpeace and WWF Brazil, signed a petition expressing their \u201cdeep concern\u201d regarding the bill which they say, \u201crepresents a huge institutional setback for Brazil and the collapse of over 40 years of development of national environmental legislation.\u201d",

      "Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration\u2019s secretive third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration's third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time, a government spokesperson said.",
      "Thabile Mdluli, the spokesperson, declined to identify the correctional facility or facilities where the five men are, citing security concerns. She said Eswatini planned to ultimately repatriate the five to their home countries with the help of a United Nations agency.",
      "In cell phone messages to The Associated Press on Thursday, Mdluli said it wasn't clear how long that would take.",
      "The men, who the U.S. says were convicted of serious crimes and were in the U.S. illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos. Their convictions included murder and child rape, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said, describing them as \"uniquely barbaric.\"",
      "Their deportations were announced by Homeland Security on Tuesday and mark the continuation of President Donald Trump's plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it was stalled by a legal challenge in the United States.",
      "Here's what we know and don't know about the deportations:",
      "Eswatini, a country of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa, is the latest nation to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, and deported eight men earlier this month to South Sudan, also an African country.",
      "The deportees to South Sudan are citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan. They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in the nearby country of Djibouti until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for them to be finally sent to South Sudan. The U.S. also described them as violent criminals.",
      "Eswatini's government confirmed on Wednesday that the latest five deportees were in its custody after landing on a deportation plane from the U.S.",
      "Local media reported they are being held at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, outside the country's administrative capital of Mbabane, which includes Eswatini's top maximum-security prison.",
      "The Eswatini government said the men are \u201cin transit\u201d and will eventually be sent to their home countries. The U.S. and Eswatini governments would work with the U.N. migration agency to do that, it said.",
      "The U.N. agency \u2014 the International Organization for Migration or IOM \u2014 said it was not involved in the operation and has not been approached to assist in the matter but would be willing to help \u201cin line with its humanitarian mandate.\u201d",
      "Eswatini's statement that the men would be sent home was in contrast to U.S. claims they were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to take them back.",
      "It's unclear how sending the men to Eswatini would make it easier for them to be deported home. There was also no timeframe for that as it depends on several factors, including engagements with the IOM, Mdluli said.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to determine the timelines for the repatriation,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Four of the five countries where the men are from have historically resisted taking back some of their citizens deported from the U.S., which has been a reoccurring problem for Homeland Security. Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration was happy the men were \u201coff of American soil\u201d when she announced their deportations.",
      "There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said \"the terms of the agreement between the U.S. and Eswatini remain classified.\u201d",
      "Eswatini has said it was the result of months of negotiations between the two governments. South Sudan has also given no details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees and has declined to say where the eight men sent there are being held.",
      "Some analysts say African nations might be willing to take deportees from the U.S. in return for more favorable relations with the Trump administration, which has cut foreign aid to poor countries and threatened them with trade tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it's seeking more deportation deals with other countries.",
      "Rights groups have questioned the countries the U.S. has chosen to deal with, as South Sudan and Eswatini have both been criticized for having repressive governments.",
      "Eswatini is Africa's only absolute monarchy, meaning the king has power over government and rules by decree. Political parties are banned and pro-democracy protests have been quelled violently in the past.",
      "Several rights groups have criticized Eswatini since pro-democracy protests erupted there in 2021, citing deadly crackdowns by security forces and abusive conditions in prisons, including at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, where pro-democracy activists are held.",

Cristosal quietly got staff and their families out before publicly announcing they were leaving out of fear that they could be targeted by the Bukele government.",
      "The decision came after its top anti-corruption lawyer Ruth L\u00f3pez was jailed in June on enrichment charges, which the organization denies.",
      "Cristosal's legal team has supported hundreds of cases alleging the government arbitrarily detained innocent people in its crackdown on gangs, and has unlawfully detained Venezuelans deported from the U.S. L\u00f3pez headed many of those investigations. In a court appearance in June, she appeared shackled and escorted by police.",

      "But L\u00f3pez's court appearance was the moment that Bullock said he knew they would have to leave the country.",
      "At the same time, the government has arrested more critics, while others have quietly fled the country. In late May, El Salvador\u2019s Congress passed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.",
      "Bullock said the the law would make it easier for the government to criminalize staff and cripple the organization economically.",
      "Cristosal's flight from the country marks another blow to checks and balances in a country where Bukele has virtually consolidated control of the government. Bullock said no longer being able to work in the country will make it significantly harder for the organization to continue their ongoing legal work, particularly supporting those detained with little access to due process.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are signing a treaty Thursday to strengthen defense ties and combat migrant smuggling across the English Channel",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "Mexico City officials have unveiled a preliminary plan to tackle gentrification",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The Mexico City government on Wednesday announced a preliminary plan to deal with gentrification, a week after a fierce protest against rising housing prices some link to mass tourism and an increase in foreigners often called \u201cdigital nomads\u201d who live temporarily in the capital city.",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said the plan will include regulation so that landlords cannot increase rents above inflation. Authorities will also share a list of \u201creasonable rental\u201d proposals.",
      "Brugada said her government will open a discussion with residents of Mexico's capital about her plan, but that the idea is to work on a bill that includes measures to promote affordable rent.",
      "The protest in early July was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads who work remotely often for foreign companies from Mexico City, according to experts. Hundreds of people marched in neighborhoods popular with tourists, but the demonstration turned violent when a small number of people began smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that the protest was marked by xenophobia.",
      "\u201cThe xenophobic displays seen at that protest have to be condemned. No one should be able to say \u2018any nationality get out of our country\u2019 even over a legitimate problem like gentrification,\u201d Sheinbaum said back then.",
      "Many Mexicans have complained about being priced out of their neighborhoods \u2014 in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.",
      "During the protest, some people marched with signs reading \u201cGringo: Stop stealing our home\u201d and \u201cHousing regulations now!\u201d",
      "Some anti-gentrification groups have called for a new protest this weekend.",

      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The massive crowd that would gather once a year at a revered waterfall in central Haiti where the faithful would splash in its sacred waters and rub their bodies with aromatic leaves was not there on Wednesday.",
      "Powerful gangs in March attacked the town of Saut-d\u2019Eau, whose 100-foot-long waterfall had for decades drawn thousands of Vodou and Christian faithful alike.",
      "The town remains under gang control, preventing thousands from participating in the traditional annual pilgrimage meant to honor the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, closely associated with the Vodou goddess of Erzulie.",
      "\u201cNot going to Saut-d\u2019Eau is terrible,\u201d said Ti-Marck Ladouce. \u201cThat water is so fresh it just washes off all the evilness around you.\u201d",
      "Instead, Ladouce joined several thousand people who scrambled up a steep hill in a rural part of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, on Wednesday to honor Erzulie and the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel at a small church that served as a substitute for the waterfall.",
      "Like many, Ladouce thanked the Virgin Mary for keeping him and his family alive amid a surge of gang violence that has left at least 4,864 people dead from October to the end of June across Haiti, with hundreds of others kidnapped, raped and trafficked.",
      "\u201cPeople are praying to be saved,\u201d he said.",
      "Daniel Jean-Marcel opened his arms, closed his eyes and turned toward the sky as people around him lit candles, clutched rosaries and tried to push their way into the small church that could not hold the crowd gathered around it.",
      "Jean-Marcel said he was giving thanks \u201cfor the grace of being able to continue living in Port-au-Prince,\u201d where gang violence has displaced more than 1.3 million people in recent years.",
      "\u201cThere is nowhere for us to go,\u201d he said, adding that he and his family would remain in Haiti even as people continue to flee the ravaged country despite an immigration crackdown by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. authorities deported more than 100 Haitians to their homeland on the latest such flight.",
      "Jacques Pl\u00e9d\u00e9, 87, was among those dressed in all white who gathered to give thanks in Port-au-Prince, of which 85% is now controlled by gangs.",
      "He recalled helping build the small church but never thought it would serve as a substitute for the Saut-d\u2019Eau waterfall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very disgraceful for the country that the gangs are taking over one of the nicest waterfalls where people go to pray privately,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is not over. One day, if I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019ll make it back to Saut-d\u2019Eau.\u201d",
      "On the morning of March 31, the Canaan gang led by a man known as \u201cJeff\u201d attacked Saut-d\u2019Eau. Police and a self-defense group repelled the attack, but the gang returned in early April with more than 500 men, prompting residents and authorities to flee, according to a new report from the U.N. human rights office.",
      "Angry over the ongoing violence and what the United Nations described as \u201cweak responses from authorities,\u201d residents of Saut-d\u2019Eau and other nearby communities in May and June took over a hydroelectric plant in protest, causing widespread power outages in Haiti\u2019s capital and its central region.",
      "On Wednesday, videos posted on social media showed Jeff Larose, leader of the Canaan gang, standing in the large church of Saut-d\u2019Eau that traditionally hosted the annual Mass amid the three-day pilgrimage. The church was built under a presidential order after rumors began circulating in the mid-1800s that a local farmer had seen the Virgin Mary in a palm tree there.",
      "Next to Larose stood Joseph Wilson, who goes by \u201cLanmo Sanjou\u201d and is the leader of the 400 Mawozo gang, and Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, best known as \u201cBarbecue\" and one of the leaders of a powerful gang federation known as \u201c Viv Ansanm,\u201d or \u201cLiving Together.\u201d",
      "The video showed them distributing money to some residents who gathered with their arms outstretched.",
      "\u201cThey used to stop us from coming to Mount Carmel,\u201d Barbecue said. \u201cWe are at the foot of our mother now.\u201d",
      "At one point, Lanmo Sanjou looked at the camera and said the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel would give them the opportunity to perform more miracles.",
      "The sounds of laughter and gurgling water were absent on Wednesday at the church in Haiti's chaotic capital where the substitute pilgrimage was underway.",
      "Hugens Jean, 40, recalled how he and his family in previous years would visit Saut-d\u2019Eau, where they would wash themselves in the waters and cook meals in the nearby woods.",
      "\u201cToday is a very special day,\u201d he said. \u201cI come here to pray for deliverance for my family and for the country that\u2019s in the hands of gangs. One day, we need to be free from these systematic attacks. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to live today or who\u2019s going to die tomorrow.\u201d",

      "\u201cHowever you try to package this, what we have is a real-terms investment and spending freeze,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cIt is the status quo, which the Commission has always insisted is not an option.\u201d",
      "Part of the numbers confusion is due to von der Leyen's insistence that national contributions to the budget will not increase. Extra funds would be found through \u201ca step change\u201d in the way the commission raises its own money, she said.",
      "The EU as a bloc is not allowed to levy its own taxes, but it does earn revenue from things like customs duties and value added tax. The plan now is to get money through the carbon emissions trading system and a new tobacco duty, among other measures.",
      "At the same time, the EU must also pay off billions of euros in debt incurred by measures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to help revive economies after the pandemic.",
      "As for security, von der Leyen said 100 billion euros ($116 billion) should be set aside to help Ukraine rebuild from the ravages of the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "\u201cWe are suggesting 100 billion euros ... to support recovery, resilience, and of course their path to the EU membership,\u201d she said.",
      "Outside the commission headquarters, as von der Leyen\u2019s team debated the plan, around 200 farmers gathered and threw boots at the building.",
      "\u201cEverybody is talking about security for Europe. Everybody is talking about a stronger Europe. Well ,let me tell you, you can\u2019t get stronger with an empty stomach,\u201d said Lode Ceyssens, head of the Belgian farmers trade union Boerenbond.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 Cambodia on Wednesday said that an order by Prime Minister Hun Manet for government bodies to crackdown on criminal cybercrime operations being run in the country had resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 suspects so far this week.",
      "Hun Manet issued the order authorising state action for \u201cmaintaining and protecting security, public order, and social safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government has observed that online scams are currently causing threats and insecurity in the world and the region. In Cambodia, foreign criminal groups have also infiltrated to engage in online scams,\u201d Hun Manet\u2019s statement, dated Tuesday, said.",
      "The United Nations and other agencies estimate that cyberscams, most of them originating from Southeast Asia, earn international criminal gangs billions of dollars annually.",
      "More than 1,000 suspects were arrested in raids in at least five provinces between Monday and Wednesday, according to statements from Information Minister Neth Pheaktra and police.",
      "Those detained included more than 200 Vietnamese, 27 Chinese, and 75 suspects from Taiwan and 85 Cambodians in the capital Phnom Penh and the southern city of Sihanoukville. Police also seized equipment, including computers and hundreds of mobile phones.",
      "At least 270 Indonesians, including 45 women, were arrested Wednesday in Poipet, a town on the border with Thailand notorious for cyberscam and gambling operations, the minister said. Elsewhere, police in the northeastern province of Kratie arrested 312 people, including nationals of Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam, while 27 people from Vietnam, China and Myanmar were arrested in the western province of Pursat.",
      "Amnesty International last month published the findings of an 18-month investigation into cybercrime in Cambodia, which the human rights group said \u201cpoint towards state complicity in abuses carried out by Chinese criminal gangs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Cambodian government is deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labor and torture being carried out by criminal gangs on a vast scale in more than 50 scamming compounds located across the country,\u201d it said.",

      "Cambodia's latest crackdown comes in the midst of a bitter feud with neighboring Thailand, which began with a brief armed skirmish in late May over border territory claimed by both nations and has now led to border closures and nearly daily exchanges of nationalistic insults. Friendly former leaders of both countries have become estranged and there have been hot debates over which nation\u2019s cultural heritage has influenced the other.",
      "Measures initiated by the Thai side, including cutting off cross-border electricity supplies and closing crossing points, have particularly heightened tensions, with Cambodia claiming they were churlish actions of spite to retaliate for its intention to pursue its territorial claims. Thailand said its original intention was to combat long-existing cyberscam operations in Poipet.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate increased to 5.92% from 5.86% last week. A year ago, it was 6.05%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "When mortgage rates rise they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",

      "The president has been calling for Powell to cut interest rates. A less independent Fed could mean lower short-term rates, but it could have the opposite effect on the longer-term bond yields that influence the rates on home loans.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "The rise in mortgage rates appears to have discouraged some home shoppers. Mortgage applications fell 10% last week from a week earlier as higher rates and economic uncertainty dampened demand, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are signing a treaty Thursday to strengthen defense ties and combat migrant smuggling across the English Channel",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A Caesars Palace casino in the heart of Times Square. A sprawling gambling hall along Coney Island\u2019s iconic boardwalk. A Hard Rock casino complex next to the home stadium of baseball\u2019s New York Mets.",
      "Eight projects are bidding for a state license to operate a casino in the lucrative New York City market, each dangling the prospect of generational investment in America\u2019s largest metropolitan region.",
      "But one \u2014 a Bally's casino proposed on a Bronx golf course once run by President Donald Trump\u2019s company \u2014 may have already run out of luck, after city lawmakers denied it a key approval this week.",
      "All of the proposed casinos, in application materials submitted in recent days, promise to create thousands of new jobs, flashy new community amenities in the form of hotels, shops, restaurants and entertainment venues and billions of dollars a year in taxable gambling revenues for the state\u2019s coffers.",
      "How realistic those promises are, though, is an open question, given the proliferation of casinos in the northeast and the explosion of online gambling in recent years, casino experts say.",
      "The arrival of full-fledged casino resorts in New York City has been years in the making.",
      "The gambling industry spent mightily to secure approval from New York voters in a referendum authorizing the licensing of up to seven full casinos with live table games back in 2013. But the state initially allowed upstate venues a head start.",
      "The state's Gaming Commission says it hopes to finally award up to three downstate licenses in December. But before then, community advisory committees appointed by lawmakers and local officials will weigh community opinions of each plan.",
      "Nearly all the casino proposals face some degree of local push back.",
      "On Monday, the New York City Council denied Bally's a needed rezoning change following local resident concerns about the environmental impact of its $4 billion proposal, which also calls for a 500-room hotel and a 2,000-seat event center.",
      "Bally\u2019s, which bought the former Trump Links course in 2023, had promised to pay Trump another $115 million if it were to secure a casino license, though that was not among the objections voiced by the Democratic majority on the council nor the Republican lawmaker representing the Bronx district. Spokespersons for Bally\u2019s declined to comment on the future of the project this week.",
      "Not surprisingly, the debate over the proposed Times Square casino has taken center stage, with supporters and opponents recently holding dueling rallies in the Crossroads of the World.",
      "Among the prominent groups opposed to the $5.4 billion plan is the Broadway League, a trade group representing America\u2019s performing arts theaters. It says a casino would draw patrons away from neighborhood businesses and threaten a theater industry still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The project's backers have countered that the plan, which calls for renovating a skyscraper that currently houses the Minskoff Theatre, home of long-running \u201cThe Lion King\u201d musical, will actually boost demand for Broadway tickets.",
      "The developers, which have also enlisted Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation to curate their entertainment offerings, promise $250 million in community projects, including a public safety plan designed by former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and a multimillion-dollar civil rights museum that helped earn an endorsement from the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "The two other casinos proposed in Manhattan \u2014 one for its West Side and another on its East Side \u2014 could face similar headwinds, given their proximity to residential neighborhoods, according to casino experts.",
      "But the proposed West Side resort, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey, could reel in business travelers and convention attendees, if it can win over locals, said Soojin Ha, a lecturer at Cornell University\u2019s business school.",
      "Meanwhile in Brooklyn, organizers of the quirky Mermaid Parade are among those leading the charge against a Coney Island casino, arguing the plan would remove large chunks of the boardwalk\u2019s iconic amusement rides and block access to the public beach.",
      "Since the 2013 referendum, four full casinos have opened in New York, though all of them are located upstate, miles away from Manhattan. The state also has nine gambling halls offering slot machines and other electronic gambling machines but no live table games.",
      "Some three hours drive north of Manhattan are the Native American tribe-owned Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos in Connecticut. Two hours south are the New Jersey shore casinos of Atlantic City, and less than two hours due west in Pennsylvania is the tribe-owned Wind Creek Casino at the former site of Bethlehem Steel.",
      "Despite the competition from seemingly all corners, New York City\u2019s dense market could sustain three gambling halls, depending on where they\u2019re located, suggests John Holden, a business professor at Indiana University who specializes in gambling law.",
      "\u201cWe typically see fairly rosy revenue projections put out by the gaming industry, but the New York City market is really without comparison,\u201d he said.",
      "The state could hedge its bets by awarding two of the three licenses to proven winners: the racinos -- slot parlors built alongside horse racing tracks \u2014 that have been successfully operating for years in the New York City area, said Alan Woinski, a New Jersey-based gambling consultant.",
      "MGM Resorts is proposing a $2.3 billion expansion of the Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway. Resorts World, owned by Malaysian casino giant Genting, is proposing a $5.5 billion investment to its gaming facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.",
      "Those expansions, Woinski noted, could be rolled out in a matter of months, meaning the state wouldn\u2019t have to wait years for the construction of a wholly new site to start reaping the financial windfall.",

      "A Trump administration proposal could put more than a million low-income households at risk of losing their government-subsidized housing",
      "WOODINVILLE, Wash. -- More than 1 million low-income households \u2014 most of them working families with children \u2014 who depend on the nation\u2019s public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance.",
      "That\u2019s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.",
      "\u201cIf currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,\" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities \"would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.\u201d",
      "Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is determined to reshape HUD\u2019s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.",
      "At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.\u201d",
      "Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there\u2019s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented \u2014 how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.",
      "The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD\u2019s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.",
      "HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.",
      "\u201cThere is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,\u201d Lovett said in a statement.",
      "The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area\u2019s median income.",
      "\u201cHousing assistance is especially impactful for children,\u201d said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can \u201cchange in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,\u201d Aiken said.",
      "Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and \u201cable-bodied\u201d for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.",
      "Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent \u2014 30% of her household income \u2014 for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.",
      "Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: \u201cI like that I can afford it.\u201d",
      "Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits \u2014 the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.",
      "Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.",
      "\u201cAny conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,\u201d said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.",
      "Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn\u2019t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.",
      "Shawnt\u00e9 Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have \u201cgiven folks motivation\u201d to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said.",
      "But with the Bay Area\u2019s high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists.",
      "\u201cI believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,\u201d said Spears. \u201cWhen folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.\u201d",

      "While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion.

      "Netflix\u2019s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers.",
      "The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week \u2013 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed \u201cSirens,\u201d \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d as being among its most watched programming.",
      "The popularity of Netflix\u2019s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier.",
      "Netflix stopped providing quarterly updates on its total subscribers at the beginning of this year, but the company\u2019s revenue growth leaves no doubt that the number has grown from the 302 million reported at the end of 2024.",
      "It\u2019s gradually turning into an advertising magnet, too.",
      "Although Netflix still isn\u2019t selling enough commercials to require a disclosure of its advertising revenue, management continues to highlight the growth in its results. Netflix said its ad revenue for this year is on pace to double from last year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy.",
      "Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts.",
      "Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase.",
      "There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines.",
      "Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count the American consumer out yet,\" said Long in a statement. \"There\u2019s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.\u201d",
      "The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. For businesses, that has made it harder to manage supply and inventories. Americans are focusing more on necessities, when they do shop.",
      "The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month.",
      "Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates.",
      "Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs.",
      "Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes.",
      "One big litmus test was Amazon\u2019s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year.",
      "Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders.",
      "Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she\u2019s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn\u2019t see big fire sales.",
      "\u201dPeople aren\u2019t buying things that they don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a healthier retail environment.\u201d",
      "Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy\u2019s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies.",
      "Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren\u2019t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in three months, a sign that the U.S. labor market remains sturdy despite fears over the impact of widespread U.S. tariffs.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that jobless claims for the week ending July 12 fell by 7,000 to 221,000, the fifth straight weekly decline and the fewest since mid-April. Last week\u2019s number was also lower than the 232,000 that analysts forecast. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as representative of layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a surprising 147,000 jobs in June, adding to evidence that the American labor market continues to show resilience despite uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies. The job gains were much bigger than expected and the unemployment rate ticked down 4.1% from 4.2% in May. Analysts were expecting the unemployment to rise to 4.3%.",
      "Though the job market is broadly healthy by historical standards, some weakness has surfaced as employers contend with fallout from Trump\u2019s policies, especially his aggressive tariffs, which raise prices for businesses and consumers. Most economists believe the import duties make the economy less efficient by reducing competition. They also invite retaliatory tariffs from other countries, hurting U.S. exporters and potentially driving businesses to freeze hiring or cut staff.",
      "The deadline on most of Trump\u2019s stiff proposed taxes on imports were extended again until Aug. 1. Unless Trump reaches deals with other countries to lower the tariffs, economists fear they could act as a drag on the economy and trigger another bout of inflation.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Procter & Gamble, Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s report Thursday said that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out some of the weekly ups and downs, fell by 6,250 to 229,500.",
      "The total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the week of July 5 remained stable, ticking up by just 2,000 to 1.96 million.",

      "TOKYO -- Canadian retail chain Alimentation Couche-Tard is dropping its proposal to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, citing frustration in ongoing negotiations that showed \u201ca lack of constructive engagement.\u201d",
      "The 7-Eleven parent company rejected an offer last year, but Couche-Tard, which runs the global Circle K chain, was still interested and tried to coax a deal with the Japanese chain known here as \u201cconbini.\u201d",
      "In a letter dated July 16 and sent to the Seven & i board, Couche-Tard stressed it had made a good offer earlier this year in a proposal of 2,600 yen ($17.50) per ordinary share in cash, which it said represented a 47.6% premium to the stock price. The initial offer, made last year, was for 2,200 yen ($14.86) per share in cash.",
      "In the letter, sent to media Thursday and signed by its two top executives, including founder Alain Bouchard, Couche-Tard expressed exasperation at the response it was getting from Seven & i despite repeated attempts at dialogue.",
      "\u201cWe have been very patient and respectful throughout this process, beginning with our meeting on July 23, 2024,\u201d the letter said.",
      "\u201cYou have engaged in a calculated campaign of obfuscation and delay, to the great detriment of 7 & i and its shareholders. We believe this approach reinforces our concerns about your approach to governance. Based on this persistent lack of good faith engagement, we are withdrawing our proposal.\u201d",
      "Couche-Tard, which runs nearly 17,000 stores in more than 30 countries and territories, including the U.S., said the documents it got lacked key information, executives were no-shows at meetings, and the meetings it did have ended up being \u201creadouts\u201d of statements, not frank discussions.",
      "Seven & i acknowledged the dropped offer Thursday and said it considered talks \u201cin good faith and constructively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain fully committed to our standalone value creation plan, which we have been pursing in parallel, and to unlocking the value of our businesses, including our North American convenience store business. Our plan is concrete and actionable,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Some analysts say Seven & i management has not fully leveraged the business\u2019 global potential or delivered enough value to shareholders, and could use better marketing, although its bottom line is unlikely to be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "The 7-Eleven franchise, which spans more than 85,000 stores in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, has a new chief executive, Stephen Hayes Dacus, the first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven. Dacus, an American whose mother is Japanese, has promised a leaner business by focusing on the supply chain and tailoring shop offerings to various regions.",
      "For the first quarter of this fiscal year, Seven & i reported a doubling in profits to 49 billion yen ($330 million), mainly due to previously announced sales of property and equipment at its Ito-Yokado Co. retail chain.",
      "Quarterly sales held up, as a favorable exchange rate helped some overseas earnings, according to the Tokyo-based chain. The seemingly omnipresent 7-Eleven chain speckles the streets of Japan, offering everything from stationery items and rice balls to hot coffee and utility bill payments.",

      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart\u2019s plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company\u2019s annual report.",

      "HAVANA -- A Cuban minister who sparked criticism after saying that there are no beggars in Cuba, only people disguised as such, resigned Tuesday.",
      "Cuba's Presidency said in a post on X that Minister of Labor and Social Security Marta Elena Feit\u00f3 Cabrera \u201cacknowledged her errors and submitted her resignation.\u201d",
      "Feit\u00f3 made the comments Monday before deputies in a National Assembly committee. The comments went viral, prompting calls for Feit\u00f3's impeachment and a wave of criticism in a country experiencing a tough economic situation in recent years.",
      "Even Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel was critical. Without mentioning her by name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feit\u00f3 participated, D\u00edaz-Canel said on his X account: \u201cthe lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.\u201d",
      "The economic crisis in Cuba has increased social vulnerability and led to unusual scenes for the island, such as people \u2014 especially the elderly \u2014 begging or scavenging through garbage, or some cleaning windshields at corners.",
      "\u201cWe have seen people, apparently beggars, (but) when you look at their hands, look at the clothes these people are wearing, they are disguised as beggars, they are not beggars,\" Feit\u00f3 said before the National Assembly committee. \"In Cuba there are no beggars.\u201d",

      "The pension of a retiree is about 2,000 Cuban pesos per month, roughly $5 on the informal market, and just under the cost of a carton of eggs. For those who don\u2019t receive remittances from family abroad, it means going hungry.",

    "story": [
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two strong choices for those willing to sacrifice some interior space, especially in the third row, for exceptional fuel economy and a lower price",
      "The 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid and 2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two three-row SUVs with compelling attributes if you\u2019re shopping for a family-oriented vehicle. First, they\u2019re both hybrids and get excellent fuel economy. They\u2019re also smaller and less expensive than many other three-row SUVs, such as the Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander. Not everyone needs a giant vehicle with a third-row seat that can fit full-size adults \u2014 something for occasional use by bigger kids or teens can easily suffice.",
      "If any or all of that sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, the Sorento and Highlander hybrids should fit the bill. But which one should you buy? Edmunds\u2019 car experts have tested both to find out.",
      "We\u2019ve already indicated that the Sorento and Highlander have less third-row legroom than bigger three-row SUVs. They also have less cargo space when you raise their third-row seats. Of these two vehicles, the Highlander is bigger on the outside, although that doesn\u2019t entirely translate to a bigger interior. It\u2019s wider and comes standard with seating for six people. You can get a Highlander Hybrid with an optional second-row bench seat that increases capacity to seven.",
      "The Sorento Hybrid only comes with second-row captain\u2019s chairs and, as a result, it has a maximum six-passenger capacity. The Highlander can also fit slightly more stuff behind its third row \u2014 think an extra duffel or big grocery bag \u2014 and its advantage increases with each row lowered.",
      "On the other hand, the Sorento has slightly more third-row legroom and headroom. That\u2019s relative since only small people can fit in the way back of each. Indeed, the Highlander\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t that significant, and the Sorento\u2019s smaller exterior size is a benefit in terms of parking and maneuverability \u2014 two reasons one can contemplate this smaller three-row subset to begin with.",
      "Advantage: Toyota Highlander Hybrid",
      "The Sorento Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving in its standard front-wheel-drive configuration. Opting for all-wheel drive drops that slightly to 34 mpg combined. Every Highlander Hybrid has all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. You can pretty much consider this a tie.",
      "Performance differs, however. At the Edmunds test track, an all-wheel-drive Sorento Hybrid accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a respectable time for a three-row hybrid SUV. It feels quick, too, thanks to the ample torque provided by the turbocharged engine and electric motor. It also has a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts quickly and smoothly. Having front-wheel drive standard is also nice as it lowers the cost of entry for those who don\u2019t need the winter-ready traction of all-wheel drive.",
      "The Highlander Hybrid went from zero to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds, which is slower than non-hybrid SUVs by about a second. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, but Toyota\u2019s more typical hybrid powertrain features a continuously variable automatic transmission that makes the engine drone under hard acceleration. That engine is also not turbocharged.",
      "Advantage: Kia Sorento Hybrid",
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid starts at $40,105, or about $8,000 less than the $48,315 Highlander Hybrid \u2014 adding all-wheel drive to the Kia only reduces the gap by $1,800. The Highlander does come with a few extra standard features to partially offset its higher price, but we don\u2019t think they fully justify the price premium. Moreover, the Highlander continues to be similarly more expensive when you compare each vehicle\u2019s more well-equipped trim levels.",
      "The Sorento also has a better infotainment system as standard, with a 10.25-inch touchscreen packing integrated navigation. The Highlander\u2019s standard unit is only 8 inches and lacks navigation. You can, however, add the 12.3-inch touchscreen that\u2019s standard on upper trims to the base trim as a stand-alone option. Feature content within the infotainment systems is comparable, but the Kia has multiple USB ports in each row whereas the Highlander has none in the third row. In terms of functionality, we score both the Toyota and Kia tech interfaces similarly strong in terms of usability.",
      "Safety technology content is similarly robust in both SUVs, but the Sorento\u2019s are superior in terms of performance, especially the adaptive cruise control system.",
      "Advantage: Kia",
      "The Sorento and Highlander hybrids are similar in concept, but our testing team ultimately scores the Kia higher. Moreover, the Toyota is so much more expensive regardless of trim level that it makes the Kia look like that much stronger of a choice.",

      "Democrats also scoffed at the GOP's stated motivation for taking up the bill. The amount of savings pales compared to the $3.4 trillion in projected deficits over the next decade that Republicans put in motion in passing Trump's big tax and spending cut bill two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cNow, Republicans are pretending they are concerned about the debt,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \u201cSo concerned that they need to shut down local radio stations, so concerned they are going to cut off \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 ... The idea that that is about balancing the debt is laughable.\u201d",
      "With Republicans providing enough votes to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama. The House has already shown its support for the president\u2019s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote.",
      "Republicans who vote against the measure also face the prospect of incurring Trump's wrath. He has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the rescissions package. He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cAny Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump says he's finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation project",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation project.",
      "The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker, who has resisted the Republican president's calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration's tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation.",
      "Trump indicated Tuesday that Powell\u2019s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. \u201cI think it sort of is,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cWhen you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it\u2019s really disgraceful,\u201d Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a \u201cpalace.\u201d",
      "The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump\u2019s first term. But it only recently caught the White House\u2019s attention. Trump maintains Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs.",
      "The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America\u2019s financial markets, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "The Fed chair has been an obstacle in Trump's efforts to gain total control over the executive branch.",
      "Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House \u2014 other than for nominations of Fed officials \u2014 allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants.",
      "An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed\u2019s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy.",
      "The Supreme Court recently signaled that Trump can\u2019t fire Powell simply because the president disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or dereliction of duty.",
      "Trump's workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal.",
      "The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building's construction in the 1930s.",
      "The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and '40s, is located near some of Washington\u2019s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018.",
      "The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds this is the first \u201ccomprehensive renovation.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project's expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted.",
      "Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington's local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier.",
      "In 2024, the Fed's board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs.",
      "The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs \u201cover time\u201d because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now.",
      "Russ Vought, the administration's top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d about the Fed's \u201costentatious overhaul\u201d of its facilities.",
      "The Fed's renovation plans call for \u201crooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,\" Vought said in last week's letter.",
      "Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no VIP dining room,\" Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no new marble. ... There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. ... And there's no roof terrace gardens.\u201d",
      "Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says.",
      "The Fed's changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans.",
      "In its September 2021 approval of the project, the National Capital Planning Commission said it \u201cCommends\u201d the Fed for \u201cfully engaging partner federal agencies.\u201d But because the Fed changed its plans, the administration is indicating it needed to go back to the commission for a separate approval.",
      "Essentially, White House officials are saying Powell is being reckless with taxpayer money because of the cost of the renovation, but they are also accusing him of acting unethically by scaling back the project to save money.",
      "James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff whom Trump named to the commission, said in a post on X that Powell\u2019s June congressional testimony \"leads me to conclude the project is not in alignment with plans submitted to & approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.\u201d",
      "Speaking last Thursday at the planning commission meeting, Blair said he intends to tour the construction site, review materials from the Fed on how the approved 2021 renovation plans have changed and circulate a letter among his colleagues on the commission that would go to Fed officials.",
      "The central bank says, in a series of frequently asked questions on its website, that it is \"not subject to the direction\u201d of the commission and has only complied with its directives voluntarily.",
      "Instead, the Fed said it is accountable to the Senate and the House of Representatives and is overseen by an independent inspector general, not the White House. Powell has asked the inspector general to review the costs of the renovation project.",

    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise near Australia",
      "BEIJING -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting on Tuesday about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise off the Australian coast that forced commercial aircraft to change course.",
      "The exercise, held in February, saw a Chinese flotilla partially circumnavigate Australia in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.",
      "The mission was widely regarded as a display of Chinese military strength and was among several issues raised in what Albanese described as a \u201cvery constructive meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Xi said that China engaged in exercises, just as Australia engages in exercises,\u201d Albanese told reporters, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the way that it happened, including the live-fire exercises,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said the Chinese leader did not mention U.S. pressure on allies to declare positions on a potential war over Taiwan.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed on Taiwan Australia's position of support for the status quo,\u201d Albanese said. Australia has a one-China policy that recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and considers Taiwan a part of China.",
      "With the 10th anniversary of Australia's free trade deal with China falling this year, both governments have agreed to review the pact with an aim to improve economic relations.",
      "Following the meeting with Xi, Albanese met Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "At the outset of the leaders' meeting, Xi told Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with \"the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.\u201d",
      "Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying \u201cThat approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.\u201d",
      "There had been speculation that Xi would use the meeting to raise Albanese\u2019s plan to end a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year-lease on the strategically important Port of Darwin, which the United States is concerned could be used to spy on its military forces.",
      "Landbridge Industry Australia, a subsidiary of Rizhao-based Shandong Landbridge Group, signed the lease with the debt-laden Northern Territory government in 2015. That was three years after U.S. Marines began annual rotations through Darwin as part of the U.S. pivot to Asia.",
      "Chinese social media influencer Lu Wenxing had posted that China could retaliate against ending the lease with \u201ccountermeasures, such as restricting Australian companies\u2019 market access in China or tightening imports of key resources such as iron ore.\u201d",
      "But Albanese said Xi didn\u2019t raise the lease, nor did he discuss the broader issue of Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules that prevent Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure.",
      "Reporters questioned Albanese about Chinese security officials' treatment of Australian journalists who traveled to China with him.",
      "Reporter Stephen Dziedzic said he was with a camera crew on Tuesday recording a piece to camera for Australian TV news in front of a Beijing landmark when they were interrupted by security guards. The guard told them police would be called and the Australians weren't permitted to leave.",
      "Another reporter, Anna Henderson, said guards told journalists to delete their footage. Australian diplomats intervened and TV crews were permitted to leave.",
      "\u201cChina has a different system, obviously, with the media,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The state visit is Albanese's second visit to China since he was first elected prime minister in 2022.",
      "Australia, like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is caught between China and the United States. Its economy is heavily dependent on exports to China, including iron ore for the steel industry. But it also shares America's concerns about China\u2019s human rights record and its growing military activity in the Pacific, including in waters near Australia.",
      "Albanese is in Beijing at the midpoint of a weeklong trip to China that started in Shanghai \u2014 China\u2019s commercial capital \u2014 where government and business leaders from the two countries discussed deepening cooperation in tourism and reducing carbon emissions in iron ore mining and steel production.",

That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "The SEC Media Days this week highlighted the ongoing rivalry between the SEC and the Big Ten in college football",
      "ATLANTA -- There was not a Big Ten player, coach or fan was in sight this week as the College Football Hall of Fame hosted SEC Media Days. Still, the SEC\u2019s No. 1 rival found its way into conversations all week long.",
      "It\u2019s no secret the rivalry has intensified in recent years. Over the last decade, the SEC has won six of the 10 national championships. Two were won by Clemson in that stretch but the last two were won by Big Ten rivals, Michigan last year and Ohio State in January.",
      "The recent success has put a dent in the SEC\u2019s reputation as the nation's dominant conference. SEC coaches, players and Commissioner Greg Sankey have no question they\u2019re still No. 1.",
      "\u201cFor all those of you who like to speculate about super-conferences, welcome to one,\" Sankey said to open this week's event. \"We have common-sense geography, restored rivalries, record-breaking viewership. If you take the consumed viewership hours on linear TV, almost 40% of that viewership was focused on games involving Southeastern Conference universities and teams. Big Ten was next, right around 30%.\u201d",
      "The SEC also boasted 79 NFL draft picks in 2025, more than any other conference and beating the Big Ten by eight.",
      "No one put it more plainly this week than Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz when asked if he thought the SEC was the top conference in college football.",
      "\u201cThe top? The top, as in number of draft picks in the NFL? Top as in most viewership? Overall top, deepest conference in college football? Look, the more teams you add to the tournament, there\u2019s greater variance to it,\u201d Drinkwitz said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 16 of the toughest competitors in the world who are head coaches in this league. We\u2019re all driven to achieve the best, whether that\u2019s internally or externally.\u201d",
      "The Big Ten and SEC draw outsized attention in college football for other reasons. The two will soon have a bigger say over the format of the College Football Playoff \u2014 they currently differ on that \u2014 and their teams are in the mix for the top recruits every year.",
      "Early bragging rights this season between the two behemoths include Texas at Ohio State in a CFP rematch from last season, Michigan at Oklahoma and Wisconsin at Alabama, all before mid-September. The real measuring stick in this league rivalry is always going to be the postseason.",
      "Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer knows excellence is the expectation when it comes to SEC football.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility, to be at the top, right? That\u2019s the expectation. I know at Alabama, but also the expectation for the SEC as a whole. I still feel that the SEC top to bottom is as strong as you\u2019ll find,\u201d DeBoer said.",
      "DeBoer isn't wrong when he says it\u2019s the expectation. In fact, it\u2019s the standard and fan bases from Austin to Gainesville go beyond team cheers on game day. \u201cS-E-C, S-E-C\u201d chants on a fall Saturday are not a rare occurrence.",
      "The excitement is part of what drew Cam Ball to Arkansas.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, my father would wake me up on Saturdays. If we didn\u2019t go to the barber shop, we was at home, just sitting on the couch watching the game, mainly watching SEC games,\u201d he said.",
      "Playing in the conference he grew up watching still feels surreal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in a game, it\u2019s the first play, and I\u2019ll just look up and see an SEC opponent\u2019s helmet, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m really here. God is good.\u2019 This conference in general, it\u2019s just a blessing to be here,\u201d Ball said.",
      "Alex Afari Jr.'s recruiting journey ended promptly after receiving the call from Kentucky. It was his first and only SEC offer. The decision was easy: Who wouldn\u2019t want to play SEC ball?",
      "\u201cPlaying in the SEC means a lot,\" Afari said. \"I always want to play against the best players. When I got the SEC offer and that\u2019s my only one \u2014 I had like Big Ten offers or whatever, but this is my only SEC offer, and I took that chance.\u201d",
      "To Afari, no other conference compares.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even close, really. I feel like we just got the o-linemen, the d-linemen are just different, the skill players as well. We put the most players in the NFL,\" he said. \u201cEvery SEC team can beat each other, every SEC team is not weak, so I feel like that\u2019s the difference. We don\u2019t have any bad teams in the SEC.\u201d",

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers have made star outside linebacker T",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers made star outside linebacker T.J. Watt the NFL\u2019s highest-paid defensive player on Thursday, signing him to a pact that will keep the perennial All-Pro in black-and-gold well into his 30s.",
      "Watt, who was entering the final season of the four-year extension he signed in 2021, is scheduled to make $123 million over the course of the three-year agreement, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the contract had not yet been made public.",
      "ESPN first reported the extension.",
      "Watt appeared to celebrate by making a rare Instagram post on Thursday afternoon, sharing a picture of him flexing in his signature No. 90 jersey. Watt also posted a photo in his Instagram stories of him posing alongside prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and third-year Steelers outside linebacker Nick Herbig.",
      "The average annual value of $41 million eclipses the previous record contract for a defender set by Cleveland defensive lineman and reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett in March.",
      "The value also eclipses the average salary of Bengals wide receiver Ja\u2019Marr Chase, who became the league\u2019s highest-paid non-quarterback after agreeing to a new contract worth $40.25 million a season.",
      "The fact that Watt\u2019s extension is worth 2.5% more per season than Garrett\u2019s (whose overall total value of $204 million is still higher than Watt\u2019s) is not a coincidence. Watt, the 2021 Defensive Player of the Year and a four-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler, has long believed he is the best edge rusher in the NFL.",
      "For the second time in four years, he\u2019s being paid like it.",
      "Watt, who turns 31 in November, took the unusual step of skipping mandatory minicamp last month in hopes of putting pressure on Pittsburgh\u2019s front office to get something done. Head coach Mike Tomlin brushed off Watt\u2019s absence, saying it was only a matter of time before things worked themselves out.",
      "The timing couldn\u2019t be better. The new-look Steelers \u2014 now led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers \u2014 report to training camp at Saint Vincent College next Wednesday.",
      "They\u2019ll do it with a familiar face in tow. Watt, who tied an NFL record by racking up 22 1/2 sacks in 2021, is the linchpin of a defense that will be relied on heavily if the Steelers want to end a playoff drought that stretches back to the 2016 AFC Championship, a few months before the Steelers selected Watt with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 draft.",

      "OK, the returning hometown hero hadn\u2019t hit his drive out-of-bounds this time. No spectator's phone had been smashed. He hadn\u2019t made a quadruple bogey, either. So, for sure, this wasn\u2019t as bad as 2019.",
      "But McIlroy had just missed a par putt from 3 feet, eliciting groans from the spectators around the green who had flocked to the Dunluce Links on Thursday to welcome back their favorite son.",
      "Was it happening again?",
      "Not quite.",
      "Six years after opening with a 79 and missing the cut when the British Open returned to this corner of his native Northern Ireland, McIlroy made partial amends with a 1-under 70 in his first round that at least hasn\u2019t played him out of the tournament.",
      "\u201cI felt like I dealt with it really well today,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cCertainly dealt with it better than I did six years ago.\u201d",
      "Yet it was far from perfect.",
      "Starting with an opening shot that he pulled into wispy rough, McIlroy struggled off the tee throughout a turbulent round played in better-than-forecast conditions and to a backdrop of Rory mania.",
      "He hit just two fairways \u2014 on Nos. 8 and 9 \u2014 all day, losing his cool at No. 17 after another drive left into deep rough.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough enough day, especially either chopping out of the rough or out of the fairway bunkers most of the time,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cSo to shoot under par was a good effort.\u201d",
      "Yet the locals never stopped willing him on and the cries of \u201cCome on, Rory\u201d followed him around Portrush, even during a run of three bogeys in four holes from No. 11 when McIlroy's round was threatening to unravel as the wind picked up.",
      "From being 3-under par after 10 holes, McIlroy was at even par as he faced a tough second shot at the 17th. He somehow hit it to 12 feet and holed the birdie putt.",
      "There were throaty roars from the grandstand around No. 18 as he walked to the green for a 45-foot birdie putt that slipped by the hole. He tapped in, raised his putter and thanked his fans. They'll be back in droves on Friday morning, no doubt.",
      "\u201cI feel the support of an entire country out there, which is a wonderful position to be in,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the same time, you don\u2019t want to let them down. So there\u2019s that little bit of added pressure.\u201d",
      "Especially on the first tee, which McIlroy walked onto in 2019 not quite realizing the emotions he'd soon feel playing an Open on Northern Irish turf for the first time. He handled it badly and the wind that swept in off the North Atlantic coast wound up blowing him out of the tournament.",

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Altchek, who performed more than 2,000 Tommy John surgeries and was the New York Mets longtime medical director, died Thursday. He was 68.",
      "His death was announced by the Hospital for Special Surgery, where he was co-chief emeritus. Altchek told associates last year he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor.",
      "He was the Mets head team physician from 1991-2001 and medical director from 2005-24, physician of the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1999-2003 and North American medical director of the ATP Tour. Altchek was co-chief of HSS's sports medicine and shoulder service from 2005-14.",
      "\u201cWhile Dr. Altchek\u2019s intelligence and innovations certainly benefited his patients \u2014 and sports medicine in general \u2014 his biggest impact was his warm, friendly, caring personality,\u201d said Glenn S. Fleisig, biomechanics research director of the American Sports Medicine Institute. \u201cColleagues, friends, and patients all loved David and are thankful for the time we had with him.\u201d",
      "A son of orthopedic surgeon Martin Altchek, David attended Middletown High School in New York, received his undergraduate degree at Columbia and his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1982. He interned at The New York Hospital and became a resident at HSS, where he had a fellowship under Dr. Russell Warren, HSS's surgeon in chief from 1993-03 and a longtime team physician of the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cMy first Tommy John surgery was in 1993, and I did the procedure that Dr. Jobe, Dr. Frank Jobe prescribed,\u201d Altchek said during a 2024 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt took 2 1/2 hours and I was exhausted. And I realized then that we had to do something about Tommy John surgery. We had to make it a little bit easier.\u201d",
      "Working with residents and fellows, Altchek developed what was called a docking procedure and tested it on about 100 elbows.",
      "\u201cIt worked and it worked amazingly well,\u201d Altchek said. \u201cWe really did not change it at all for 20-something years.\"",
      "Altchek estimated last year he had performed more than 2,400 Tommy John surgeries. He was a preferred surgeon for the Tommy John procedure in recent years along with Texas Rangers physician Dr. Keith Meister and Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache.",
      "Part of Altchek's job was to reassure a player his baseball career was not over.",
      "\u201cYou tell them this is unfortunate, but this is your MRI. This is probably why it happened \u2014 meaning you threw outside the envelope of your tissue quality,\" he explained. \"But we have a procedure that can repair your ligament and reconstruct it in a kind of belt, suspenders way that once it heals the likelihood of you going back to pitching at the same level or above is 95%.\u201d",
      "Altchek received Columbia's John Jay Award for Distinguished Professional Achievement in 2003.",
      "He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Salmson, whom he married in 1981, sons Charles and Christopher, and daughters Chloe and Sophie. Charles is president of Major League Soccer's third-tier MLS Next Pro minor league and was the Ivy League men's soccer player of the year while at Harvard in 2005 and 2006.",

      "Bryan Braman, a key special teams player for the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 first Super Bowl championship team, has died from a rare and aggressive form of cancer. He was 38.",
      "Braman was diagnosed earlier this year and had multiple surgeries in recent months in an attempt to treat the illness. He died Thursday morning, according to a statement issued by the team.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Bryan Braman,\u201d the team said. \u201cDuring his four seasons in Philadelphia, Bryan was a loyal teammate, a supporter of the community, and a valuable member of our Super Bowl LII-winning team. More importantly, he was a devoted father who passionately loved his family and everyone around him. We extend our deepest condolences to Bryan\u2019s family and all who are grieving his loss during this difficult time.\u201d",
      "Signed as an undrafted free agent by the Texans in 2011, Braman played seven seasons in the NFL. He spent his first three in Houston and last four in Philadelphia. The Eagles beat the Patriots 41-33 to win the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl in Braman\u2019s final game on Feb. 4, 2018. He gave a fiery speech in the locker room before that game.",
      "Braman had 56 tackles, 1 1/2 sacks and two fumble recoveries in 97 career games.",

      "The Indiana Fever guard injured her right groin on Tuesday night in the final minute of the team\u2019s win over the Connecticut Sun. She said Thursday in a message posted on X that she had to rest her body.",
      "\u201cI am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can\u2019t participate in the 3-Point Contest or the All-Star Game,\u201d Clark said in the message posted by the Fever. \u201cI have to rest my body. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I\u2019m looking forward to helping (Liberty coach Sandy Brondello) coach our team to a win.\u201d",
      "Clark was supposed to compete in a loaded 3-point contest Friday night and is captain of one of the All-Star teams. The second-year guard was the leading vote getter from the fans and has been a huge reason the league has had a boon in attendance and ratings over the last two seasons.",
      "Clark sat out the team\u2019s 98-77 loss against New York.",
      "Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark had imaging done Wednesday afternoon and deferred to the team\u2019s training staff for more details except to say that she considered it good news.",
      "Clark got hurt with under a minute left. She walked downcourt holding her right groin after assisting on the Fever\u2019s final basket. As teammate Aliyah Boston tried to console her, Clark walked to the basket stanchion and banged her head against it before heading to the bench. During the timeout, she covered her head with a towel and appeared to be holding back tears.",
      "Clark had been durable throughout college and her first season in the WNBA, never missing a game. Now she\u2019s had four different muscle injuries so far this year.",
      "She missed the preseason opener with tightness in her quad but played the next day in an exhibition game at her alma mater, Iowa. She suffered a quad strain against New York on May 24 that kept her out for five games. Clark returned June 14 and played in five games before suffering another injury to her left groin that kept her out for four contests and the Commissioner\u2019s Cup final.",

      "Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood are offering reminders that the British Open doesn't discriminate against older players",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Phil Mickelson delivered more magic Thursday in the British Open, leaving one shot in a bunker and holing the next one from 75 feet away for an unlikely par. He tipped his cap. He gave a thumbs-up to the crowd.",
      "It looked like the Mickelson of old, especially with all that gray stubble in his beard.",
      "Mickelson, who opened with a 1-under 70 at Royal Portrush, already holds the major championship record for oldest winner, capturing the 2021 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island when he was 50.",
      "Now he's at the oldest championship in golf, the one that least discriminates against age. The Open is where 53-year-old Greg Norman had the lead going into the final round at Royal Birkdale in 2008, and more famously where 59-year-old Tom Watson was an 8-foot putt away from winning at Turnberry in 2009.",
      "\u201cThe Open gives the older gentlemen a chance to win more than any other tournament,\u201d 52-year-old Lee Westwood said after a day in which he was tied for the lead early in the round until a few bogeys dropped him back to a 69.",
      "Westwood is playing the British Open for the first time since he joined Saudi-funded LIV Golf in 2022, going through final regional qualifying three weeks ago to earn a spot in the field.",
      "He has yet to win in LIV Golf and his results would suggest he is riding out the rest of his career. And then he showed up at the major he first played in 1995 \u2014 Scottie Scheffler was not even born then \u2014 and found some form.",
      "Links golf helps.",
      "\u201cThere's not the premium on carrying traps. They don't make it unplayable for us older guys with length,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cYou can use your experience, guile and cunning on them.\u201d",
      "Westwood tripped over his words on the Sky Sports interview and then added, \u201cNot easy to say, but easy to use at our age.\u201d",
      "Mickelson, who has not won since that historic day at Kiawah Island, had missed the cut in all three majors this year. At age 55, he still has six more years playing the British Open as a champion at Muirfield in 2013.",
      "He started strong with a deft touch with his wedge to easy birdie range on the par-5 second, but the real Lefty showed up on the next hole when he put his tee shot into a bunker, plugged and not far from the steep lip.",
      "The first attempt barely got out, rolling on the edge of grass before tumbling back into the bunker. It looked like a bogey at best. But then he splashed out, carrying it some 25 yards and about 10 feet to the left, and the shot had enough side spin to drop into the cup.",
      "He raised both arms. Mickelson loves moments like these, and he's had plenty of them.",
      "\u201cThat was a crazy one,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt was really one of maybe two poor shots I hit, that bunker shot that buried in the lip. And then to make it was obviously a lot of luck. I was just trying to save bogey, and I got lucky it went in.\u201d",
      "And then his name stayed on the leaderboard the rest of the morning \u2014 a birdie on the par-5 seventh, a couple of bogeys on the back nine, a 20-foot birdie on the 17th hole.",
      "Mickelson had gone 21 consecutive rounds in a major without breaking par until Thursday in the British Open. Sure, he had the advantage of missing the rain for all but the last couple of holes. But it was good golf. It's still there.",
      "\u201cI played really well, and I had an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI really enjoy playing these conditions and playing this tournament. It\u2019s just a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Not all of the 50-and-older gang had the best of times.",
      "Padraig Harrington, coming off his win in the U.S. Senior Open, had the honor and thrill of hitting the opening tee shot. He made birdie on the first hole. That was the highlight on his card when he signed for a 74.",
      "\u201cI got a little emotional when I was clapped on, and then I calmed down, and I was kind of fine when I was hitting it,\u201d Harrington said.",
      "He three-putted two straight holes and had a lost ball on No. 10. It was an otherwise forgettable day, except for the unforgettable start of hitting the first shot.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was a tough day on the greens, and it just ate into my game,\u201d he said. \u201cMight have been a little bit of the fact that I was hyped up for the first tee box. Who knows? Certainly felt like I played better, could have played better, should have played better.\u201d",

      "It is the world's most popular sport and yet there is still debate over what it should actually be called.",
      "Is it football or soccer?",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump waded into the topic while at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey last Sunday. He joked that he could pass an executive order to bring the United States in line with much of the rest of the world and ensure that from now on Americans refer to it as football.",
      "\u201cI think I could do that,\u201d he said with a smile during an interview with host broadcaster DAZN.",
      "It was a light-hearted comment, but at a time when the U.S. is playing an increasingly significant role in soccer the question of why Americans continue to call it by a different name to the one by which it is most commonly known has been raised again.",
      "\u201cThey call it football, we call it soccer. I'm not sure that change could be made very easily,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Soccer keeps growing in the U.S. and so does its influence on the sport. It is co-hosting the men's World Cup with Canada and Mexico next year \u2014 the third year in a row that it stages a major tournament after the 2024 Copa America and this summer's Club World Cup.",
      "Other factors are keeping soccer more often in the U.S. consciousness -- and perhaps they will make saying \u201dfootball\" more commonplace in a tough sporting landscape.",
      "One of the greatest players of all time, Lionel Messi, plays for MLS team Inter Miami; the popularity of the Premier League and Champions League is booming; and the documentary series \u201cWelcome to Wrexham\u201d about a low-level Welsh club co-owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, has attracted new eyeballs.",
      "Despite \u201csoccer\u201d being widely associated with the U.S., it is commonly accepted that the word was actually coined in Britain, perhaps as far back as the 1880s.",
      "The exact date when it was first used is not known, but it is believed \u201csoccer\u201d was derived from \u201cassociation football,\u201d which was the first official name of the sport.",
      "The charity English Heritage says the nickname may have first been used by pupils at the iconic Harrow School to \u201cdistinguish the new association game from their older pursuit, known as \u2018footer.\u2019\u201d",
      "Numerous versions of football began to flourish, often involving handling a ball more than kicking it. One example dating back to the 1600s and still played today in England is Royal Shrovetide. Rugby is another example.",
      "The English Football Association was created in 1863 and drew up codified rules for associated football to set it apart from other versions being played elsewhere in Britain and, from there, soccer as we know it was born.",
      "Dr. Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan, wrote the book \u201cIt\u2019s Football, Not Soccer (And Vice Versa)\u201d and explored the origins of the name. In a lecture to the American University of Beirut in 2019 he said soccer was \u201cvery clearly a word of English/British origin.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd bear in mind that the name \u2018association football\u2019 doesn\u2019t really appear until the 1870s,\" he said, \u201cso it appears really very early on in the history of the game and the word 'soccer' has been used over and over again since it was coined at the end of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "\u201cSoccer\u201d is not a commonly used term in Britain these days but that has not always been the case.",
      "It was the title of a popular Saturday morning television show, \u201cSoccer AM,\u201d which ran from 1994 to 2023 on the Premier League's host broadcaster Sky Sports.",
      "England great and 1966 World Cup winner Bobby Charlton ran popular schools for decades, titled \u201cBobby Charlton's Soccer School.\u201d",
      "And Matt Busby \u2014 Manchester United's iconic manager who won the 1968 European Cup \u2014 titled his autobiography, which was published in 1974, \u201cSoccer at the Top, My Life in Football.\"",
      "That book title suggests the terms \u201csoccer\u201d and \u201cfootball\u201d were interchangeable in British culture at that time.",
      "Szymanski suggested the problem some people have with \u201csoccer\u201d isn't the word at all. But rather that it is specifically used in America.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s when Americans use this word that we get the outpourings of distress and horror, and one of the most popular thoughts that people throw at this is to say that American football is not really football,\u201d he said in his lecture.",
      "He argued that given the overwhelming popularity of the NFL in the U.S. it makes perfect sense to differentiate between soccer and its own version of football.",
      "The use of the word \u201csoccer\u201d is a bit more confused in other countries.",
      "Australia, which has its own Australian rules football along with both rugby codes, commonly uses the term and its national men's team are known as the Socceroos. It's soccer federation, however, is called Football Australia.",
      "It's a similar situation in Ireland, where Gaelic football is popular. The term \u201csoccer\u201d is used but the national soccer team is still governed by a body called the Football Association of Ireland.",
      "Canada, like the U.S. simply calls it soccer, which clearly distinguishes it from the NFL and Canadian Football League.",

      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- The oldest major championship has taken a step into the modern world by using a technological feature that British Open organizers hope will bring to life one of the most storied walks in golf.",
      "Spidercam \u2014 that's a camera, not a super hero \u2014 was used in golf for the first time at Royal Portrush on Thursday. It\u2019s a camera suspended above the 18th green using four pylons about 25 meters high, giving TV viewers unique views of the closing hole and its undulations.",
      "Held in a resting position high to the back of the green for approach shots, Spidercam swoops down as the players make their walk to the green and hovers just above them as they make their putts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool the way it can move and do all those swings,\u201d said Northern Irish golfer Tom McKibbin, who went out at 6:35 a.m. local time in the first group of the day with Nicolai Hojgaard and Padraig Harrington.",
      "They were the first players to experience in competition the technology which reportedly cost the R&A 300,000 pounds ($400,000) to install.",
      "\u201cIt was a little bit different,\u201d McKibbin said. \u201cI\u2019d never seen it before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s because the R&A is using the technology before any of the professional tours in golf.",
      "Spidercam has, though, operated widely in TV coverage of other major sports including soccer, rugby and cricket \u2014 and has occasionally gotten in the way.",
      "In 2017, India star MS Dhoni hit a shot in a cricket match against England that smashed into the hovering camera and broke it.",
      "In 2022, South Africa cricketer Anrich Nortje was knocked to the ground when he collided with a low-swinging Spidercam as he walked to his place in the field in a test against Australia. The camera operator responsible was stood down for the remainder of the match.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know what hit me,\u201d Nortje said at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be travelling at head height.\"",
      "At Royal Portrush, Spidercam will complement existing technology such as a plane camera, aerial drones and bunker cameras to enhance TV coverage.",
      "According to the Guardian newspaper, players were briefed last week about plans to use Spidercam at Royal Portrush and there were no complaints despite the potential for getting distracted while preparing to make a shot.",
      "As Hojgaard and Harrington walked alongside each other to the 18th green, Spidercam swung down and over them. As Harrington made his two putts, the camera almost circled him.",
      "Hojgaard said he didn\u2019t notice Spidercam.",
      "With Royal Portrush not having a clubhouse on the 18th green, there has been space to install the technology. Other venues on the Open rotation won't have that luxury, notably Royal Lytham St. Anne's, Royal Troon and Hoylake.",
      "Next year's Open is at Royal Birkdale, which has its clubhouse near the 18th green but should still have room for the Spidercam technology.",
      "\u201cWe ... believe that Spidercam will bring millions of fans a new perspective of the action from Royal Portrush,\u201d said Neil Armit, chief commercial officer at the R&A, \"with incredible detail and accessibility wherever they are in the world.\u201d",

      "Yu Zidi of China is only 12 years old and will race at the world swimming championships later this month in Singapore.",
      "That's amazing.",
      "But her age is only part of the picture.",
      "Not only is she very young, but her times in three events this year are among the best in the world. And here's the kicker. Those times would have been very close to medals in last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "Again, she's 12. That's a sixth- or seventh-grade student depending on the school system. Not yet a teenager.",
      "\u201cI think it's a great story. I don't know where it will lead,\u201d Greg Meehan, the national team director for the American squad in Singapore, told The Associated Press.",
      "As promising young swimmers do, Yu is clocking personal bests almost each time she competes. Her PBs are more than just confidence boosters, they put her in sight of records, medals and stardom.",
      "Yu has qualified in the 200- and 400-meter individual medleys, and the 200 butterfly. She could win a medal in all three.",
      "Her time of 2 minutes, 10.63 seconds in the 200 IM at the Chinese championships in May was the fastest ever by a 12-year-old swimmer \u2014 male or female \u2014 according to World Aquatics, the global governing body of the sport.",
      "That was only the start. Her time of 2:06.83 in the 200 butterfly in the same meet would have placed her fourth in last year's Paris Olympics. It was the fifth-fastest time in the world this year and would have been good enough for gold in the 2024 worlds.",
      "Again, Yu is 12 years old.",
      "To cap off the national championships she swam 4:35.53 in the 400 IM, the fifth-fastest time of the year in that event. That also would have been good for fourth place last year at the Olympics, just 0.6 behind bronze medalist Emma Weyant of the United States.",
      "The 400 IM is dominated by 18-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, who holds the world record of 4:23.65 and the 200 IM mark of 2:05.70. She's a generational talent, the winner of three gold medals in Paris.",
      "By comparison, Yu at 12 is swimming roughly 15 seconds faster in the 400 IM than McIntosh did at 12, and about 12 seconds faster in the 200 IM. In a 50-meter pool, 12 to 15 seconds would be a half-lap of the pool, depending on the event.",
      "Yu is not the first young swimmer to excel, but it's how she's doing it \u2014 the stunning times and the promise of more to come.",
      "Of course there are no guarantees of success, and young swimmers can burn out.",
      "Yu said she began swimming at 6 in a water amusement park.",
      "\u201cThe summer was too hot, and my dad took me to the water park,\" she told China's official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cI enjoyed the coolness of the water and spent a lot of time in different small pools for kids. One day, a coach approached me and asked if I wanted to swim faster.\"",
      "The rest is history, as they say, as she explained her event preference.",
      "\u201cSince I am not competitive in the sprint events, I have to choose the 400-meter individual medley and the 200-meter butterfly as my favorites,\u201d Yu told Xinhua. \"My age is currently an advantage and I hope to grow and develop more strength in the future.\u201d",
      "Yu trains at the Hebei Taihua Jinye Swimming Club in Hengshui City, south of Beijing in Hebei Province.",
      "Alzain Tareq of Bahrain swam in the 2015 worlds at only 10. She finished last in her event. World Aquatics now has stricter age rules than a decade ago. Swimmers must be at least 14 unless their times meet qualification standards. In effect, this means there is no age limit.",
      "If Yu were to win Olympic gold in three years in Los Angeles, she would be 15. But that wouldn't make her the youngest swimmer to take gold.",

      "Olivia Miles might have been playing this weekend along with WNBA rookie Paige Bueckers at the league's All-Star Game.",
      "But Miles decided to return to college this year instead of going to the WNBA draft as a projected lottery pick. The former Notre Dame star transferred to TCU to try to improve her game, earn some extra NIL money and continue to grow her brand.",
      "\u201cI think it was a mixture of me listening to my body and what I needed and also just another year to develop, you know be in a system where it\u2019ll favor me and I\u2019ll have great teammates and a great coach around me,\" Miles told The Associated Press. \u201dI\u2019ll have a lot of fun so I\u2019m just very excited for that.\"",
      "Miles missed the 2023-24 season while recovering from an ACL tear she suffered in the regular-season finale the year before to end her sophmore campaign. She became the first men\u2019s or women\u2019s freshman to post a triple-double in the NCAA Tournament in 2022, and was putting the final touches on a season that had made her an Associated Press second-team All-American when she crashed to the baseline after her right knee buckled on a drive at Louisville in 2023.",
      "\u201cI just felt like I had a lot more left in me in the tank,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing far, far removed from my injury, mentally, physically, emotionally, was what I was telling myself, so, it was a lot of back and forth.\u201d",
      "Miles said she literally waited until the last minute to decide what she wanted to do, something she'd love to see the WNBA change in the future.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t decide until the very end, as you know, we have 48 hours to make a huge life decision, which is really hard,\u201d Miles said.",
      "One thing she\u2019s happy about when she does enter the WNBA next season is that there will be a new collective bargaining agreement that should include an increase in player salaries. Right now the rookie salary is about $75,000 for top picks. She\u2019ll make a lot more than that in college this year. The low salaries were one factor in Miles\u2019 decision, but she said it wasn\u2019t a major one.",
      "Then when she decided to stay in school, Miles made another big choice to enter the transfer portal and leave Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cI knew it was gonna be a big story. I knew it was gonna (upset) a lot of people,\" she said. \u201cI knew it was gonna cause a lot of commotion, but I ultimately was selfish one time with my career. I was talking to a bunch of power schools and then ultimately I really just wanted to go somewhere where I\u2019d be able to showcase my abilities the best that I can.\"",
      "Miles didn't get into specifics on why she decided to leave Notre Dame, but did say it was hard to tell Irish coach Niele Ivey that she was leaving.",
      "\u201cI was her first recruit so there was always a special kind of connection there, so when you have to have a hard conversation about people you care about, it's tough, but it had to be done,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to find out, apart from me, so I had to grow up in that moment we had the conversation and we kept it going.\u201d",
      "Miles said that Ivey reassured her that she'd \u201calways be a part of the family and that she loves me. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for me, she\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for her so there\u2019s always respect there from my end.\u201d",
      "She said she liked a lot of what TCU has done the last few years under coach Mark Campbell.",
      "\"I won\u2019t be restricted anywhere, I\u2019ll be able to kind of flow and have fun and really showcase before I get to the league,' she said.",

      "ATLANTA -- The Southeastern Conference's evolving quarterback situations continued to be a focal point of SEC media days on Wednesday.",
      "Florida quarterback DJ Lagway went 6-1 after taking over as the starter midway through 2024, creating some buzz around the Gators heading into year four of the Billy Napier era.",
      "Mississippi State quarterback Blake Shapen is back after a shoulder injury ended his 2024 season in September, and the Bulldogs are looking to respond from a winless league campaign in year two under Jeff Lebby.",
      "Meanwhile, Tennessee has an ongoing quarterback battle with three participants, headlined by Appalachian State transfer Joey Aguilar.",
      "Tennessee underwent one of the highest profile quarterback changes. Former five-star recruit Nico Iamaleava started all 13 games for the Volunteers last season as they reached the College Football Playoff, but departed the week of the spring game before eventually transferring to UCLA.",
      "Coach Josh Heupel \u2014 a former National Championship winning quarterback himself \u2014 confirmed three quarterbacks are still in the mix to earn the job heading into preseason camp.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve found a way to win with a lot of different quarterbacks throughout my career,\u201d Heupel said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to find a way to win with the guy that earns a starting spot as we go through training camp here in August.\u201d",
      "Aguilar initially transferred from Appalachian State to UCLA in December, but re-entered the portal and enrolled at Tennessee following Iamaleava\u2019s exit. He started 11 games for the Mountaineers in 2024, throwing for 3,002 yards and 23 touchdowns with 14 interceptions. Jake Merklinger appeared in two games last season while redshirting, and George MacIntyre is an incoming true freshman.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s about getting to training camp and going and competing,\u201d Heupel said. \u201cSomebody is going to earn the opportunity to be our starting quarterback through that process.\u201d",
      "As Napier enters his fourth season, only one player on his roster has appeared in every single game of his tenure. Center Jake Slaughter brings a streak of 38 consecutive games played and 21 consecutive starts into 2025, and was the only 2024 AP All-America selection in attendance at SEC media days.",
      "\u201cHe was voted team captain by his teammates last year, and he very much lives it out,\u201d Napier said about Slaughter. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that sets the tone every day.\u201d",
      "The battery between Slaughter and Lagway sparked a late charge last fall, helping Florida rebound from a 4-5 start to win its final four games including upsets of then No. 22 LSU and No. 9 Ole Miss. Lagway's 6-1 mark as a starter tied Chris Leak for the most wins by a true freshman quarterback in program history.",
      "\u201cHe treats everything like it\u2019s the last thing he\u2019s ever going to do,\u201d Slaughter said on Lagway. \u201cBut then on game day, he\u2019s got a different type of swag to him. He\u2019s getting everybody fired up. You don\u2019t see that from Sunday through Friday, just Saturday.\u201d",
      "Lebby has nowhere to go but up after a winless conference season and a 2-10 overall record in 2024. Part of Mississippi State\u2019s struggles last season spiraled from Shapen\u2019s injury. The Baylor transfer fractured his right scapula in week four and the Bulldogs went 1-7 in his absence.",
      "\u201cI am 100% healthy,\u201d Shapen said. \u201cObviously it was tough not playing last year, but I\u2019m back now and I feel better than ever.\u201d",
      "Shapen threw eight touchdowns and only one interception with 974 passing yards in his limited sample size, creating some belief his return combined with an extra year of experience in Lebby\u2019s offense can help the Bulldogs in 2025.",
      "\u201cInside our walls right now we have great belief,\u201d Lebby said. \u201cOur guys are incredibly intent on getting better and changing the outcome this fall.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Four years without a national championship feels like a severe drought for veteran Alabama players.",
      "Similarly, one year of missing the College Football Playoff has second-year coach Kalen DeBoer feeling the pressure to restore the Crimson Tide's status as one of the nation's top teams in 2025.",
      "When asked Wednesday at the Southeastern Conference media days if a 9-4 finish in his 2024 debut season met the Alabama standard, DeBoer said: \u201cI mean, if you internally ask us, no. We fell short of making the playoffs. It\u2019s as simple as that, right? Giving yourself a chance to go compete for a championship.\u201d",
      "DeBoer's task is especially difficult because he's the coach who followed Nick Saban, who led Alabama to its last national championship in 2020. It was Alabama's sixth championship under Saban since 2009.",
      "Junior offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor said Wednesday the Crimson Tide players have endured a painful wait to reach the standard set by Saban.",
      "\u201cFor the whole team honestly we obviously know that we haven\u2019t won a championship in a long time,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s everybody\u2019s goal at the end of the season.\u201d",
      "Included in Alabama's 9-4 season under DeBoer was a 5-3 SEC mark that included road losses at Vanderbilt, Tennessee and Oklahoma. Alabama was No. 17 in the final AP Top 25 following a 19-13 loss to Michigan in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Florida.",
      "DeBoer, who coached the 2023 Washington team to the national championship game, says added familiarity and continuity on his staff are reasons to expect improvement.",
      "Defensive lineman Tim Keenan said another reason the Crimson Tide will be better is players believe in DeBoer. Keenan hinted the shadow of Saban followed DeBoer in 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed,\" Keenan said. \u201cYou definitely see guys definitely bought in. If they\u2019re not here, no knock to them, but everyone who is here now, they believe in the system. They believe in Coach DeBoer.\u201d",
      "Ryan Grubb, who worked on DeBoer's staff at Washington, was hired as Alabama's offensive coordinator after one season with the Seattle Seahawks.",
      "Keenan said he respects DeBoer for having the confidence to follow Saban.",
      "\u201cI know a lot of people say they want to do that, but they ain\u2019t got the courage enough to do it,\u201d Keenan said. \"So I\u2019m gonna go hard for my coach, always.",
      "\u201cJust, you know it\u2019s Coach Saban, like the greatest coach of all time. The GOAT. You know, greatest of all time. So to take that responsibility, saying. \u2018I\u2019m going to take over for him now.\u2019 ... I believe in him. And also, I know that God was going to put the right person in the right place at the right time, and he\u2019s in the right place at the right time.\u201d",
      "DeBoer said Alabama \u201cfell short\u201d last season.",
      "\u201cWe've got to be better in the big moments,\u201d DeBoer said. \"We lost some close games last year. We had chances maybe not even in the fourth quarter, but early in the game to separate ourselves or make a play here or there. Whether it was the belief or whether it was the confidence, a lot of that just comes through repetitions. We really had a great offseason understanding where we fell short, why we fell short. Not just the what and the how but the why.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited about our guys taking those next steps, understanding when we get in those moments this year, those critical times, how to come through and make the play that\u2019s necessary to go win football games.\u201d",

      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- The crowds following Rory McIlroy for three days at Royal Portrush have been enormous, a reminder of the expectations. On banners and flags and buntings of grandstands there are images of the claret jug, a reminder of what's at stake at the British Open.",
      "But add this to the list of what makes golf's oldest championship so distinct from the other majors: Every year it feels like a new experience.",
      "Justin Thomas contemplated that Wednesday when he finished up his third day playing the course, a practice schedule that is never this full at any other major.",
      "\u201cI came to the realization the last couple of years that playing is better, because your ball goes into weird places,\u201d he said. \"I can go out and chip all day, and get used to the turf and the speed of the greens. But the more you play, the more shots you're hitting in places where you never would in practice.",
      "\u201cYou get out here in a different wind and it can be, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t think I'd be here.'\u201d",
      "There is another element to this major that stands out from the U.S. Open and PGA Championship. Amid the nerves and the pressure of a major is the true joy of playing links golf.",
      "\u201cI feel like I'm learning more and more each time I come over here,\u201d said Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player who is in his fifth British Open. \"Each golf course is different, too. Irish links so far is quite a bit different than Scottish links. It's a bit greener over here. You have to play more shots in the air. ... There's a lot of different shots you have to play.",
      "\u201cIt's an interesting course,\" he said. \"And from what I've seen, it seems to be really fun to play and very fair.\u201d",
      "Fair is a loose word in these parts, with all of the humps and crazy bounces, with pot bunkers to be avoided on so many shots, with a hole like the par-3 16th known as \u201cCalamity Corner\u201d that lives up to the name by looks alone.",
      "McIlroy isn't sure he got a fair deal in 2019 when his opening tee shot went left, normally not a big deal except at Royal Portrush there is internal out of bounds, and McIlroy went just beyond the stakes, which sent him into a downward spiral \u2014 a quadruple bogey, a 79 and a short week.",
      "He did not return to the Portrush links in his native Northern Ireland until Monday morning, and then he was out playing all three days of practice.",
      "\u201cI have a real appreciation for how well bunkered it is off the tee,\u201d McIlroy said. \"It's like, \u2018OK, I can't hit 2-iron off the tee, but that brings this bunker into play. But then if I hit driver, it\u2019ll bring in this bunker.' So you have to take on the shot.",
      "\u201cSome courses that we go to in the Open rota, you can just take the bunkers out of play,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, there's always one bunker or another bunker in play. So I think off the tee, it provides a very, very good test.\u201d",
      "McIlroy was among those who felt refreshed when he finished the meat of the PGA Tour season \u2014 five signature events, The Players Championship, three majors, all in a span of three months \u2014 and arrived in the United Kingdom. The scenery, the temperature, the brand of golf, all of it felt so new, almost like he was starting a new season.",
      "Thomas felt the same way. There is a buzz in the heavy, seaside air off the North Atlantic, no matter how stiff the challenge and how much the weather changes.",
      "The forecast? It's generally been referred to as \u201cmixed,\u201d which in these parts tends to mean it changes without notice. The final day of practice was sunshine and breezy.",
      "Thomas was playing the 16th while his father showed video of them watching in the final round in 2019, wind and rain ripping so hard that umbrellas were useless.",
      "Thomas remembers standing on the 17th tee and calling over a rules official to ask if they were meant to be playing. He wanted to hit 3-wood off the tee, but it was 209 yards to the fairway and the wind was so strong he didn't think he could get there. So he went with driver, hit some 75 yards off line and made triple bogey.",
      "On his final day of practice, with sunshine and a helping wind, he hit a mini-driver that would have stopped near the front of the green on the 409-yard hole if it hadn't found a bunker.",
      "This is what he loves about links golf.",
      "\u201cNot only do the holes change, how easy or hard they are, your lines off the tee can change,\u201d he said \u201cYou have elevation. You're never writing \u2018uphill\u2019 or \u2018downhill\u2019 in the yardage book like you are at an Open Championship. You have a game plan, but you really can't until you're out there and whatever the weather is giving you.\"",
      "Thomas looked back on the 18th green before going to sign autographs for a group of children.",
      "\u201cIf I could only play one course the rest of my life it would be links,\u201d Thomas said. \"Because you could play the same course every day for a month and get something different.",
      "\u201cI love The Open. Every time I've played it, I love the tournament more and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to have a chance to win the tournament and walk up the 18th hole. Seems like it would be the coolest thing in the world.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",
      "In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document.",
      "While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches.",
      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",
      "More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.",
      "Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes.",
      "Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost.",
      "The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, \u201cdue to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.\u201d",
      "San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers \u201cin the bowels of bureaucracy\u201d to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we would deprive those who are struggling in our country from the benefits of the leading edge solutions is unacceptable,\u201d Hooks said.",

      "The Trump administration has revoked $4 billion in federal funding for California's long-delayed high speed rail project",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "That difficulty may explain why it's rare \u2014 with only about 5% of the dolphin population studied by the researchers in Shark Bay doing it. That\u2019s about 30 dolphins total, said Jacobs.",
      "\u201cIt takes them many years to learn this special hunting skill \u2014 not everybody sticks with it,\u201d said marine ecologist Boris Worm at Dalhousie University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.",

      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The International Space Station\u2019s first visitors from India, Poland and Hungary headed back to Earth on Monday, wrapping up a private mission and catching a ride home with SpaceX.",
      "Their capsule undocked from the orbiting lab and aimed for a splashdown the next morning in the Pacific off the Southern California coast.",
      "The short, privately financed mission marked the first time in more than 40 years that India, Poland and Hungary saw one of their own rocket into orbit. The three astronauts were accompanied by America\u2019s most experienced space flier, Peggy Whitson, who works for Axiom Space, which chartered the flight. They launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 25.",
      "India's Shubhanshu Shukla, Poland's Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski and Hungary's Tibor Kapu conducted dozens of experiments during their stay. They also fielded calls from their countries' prime ministers as well as schoolchildren.",
      "\"We will spread the word in our countries that these things are within our reach. These things are possible even for smaller countries like ours,\u201d Kapu said during Sunday\u2019s farewell ceremony, which ended in an emotional group hug.",
      "Shukla noted that \u201cit\u2019s truly a miracle\u201d when humanity comes together for a common goal.",
      "\u201cThe sky is no longer the limit. We can explore space,\u201d added Uznanski-Wisniewski.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski took special pride in the first pierogies in space. He took up the cabbage and mushroom-stuffed dumplings, which were freeze-dried in advance for easy cooking in zero gravity.",
      "Their three countries shared the cost of the mission, paying more than $65 million apiece.",
      "It was Axiom's fourth station trip since 2022. The Houston company's clientele includes the wealthy as well as countries seeking representation in space. NASA embraces commercial spaceflight, helping to set the stage for private space stations in the works by Axiom and others, as well as lunar landers.",
      "The space station's seven full-time residents remain behind in orbit, representing the U.S., Russia and Japan. Four of them will be replaced in a few weeks by a fresh crew launched for NASA by SpaceX.",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

    "story": [
      "The president was diagnosed after experiencing \"mild\" swelling in his legs.",
      "President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, the White House announced on Thursday.",
      "Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a letter from Trump's physician in a news conference, which said Trump was examined after he noticed \"mild\" swelling in his legs.",
      "Leavitt said the physician described the condition as \"benign\" and \"common,\" particularly among adults above age 70.",
      "Leavitt added that the president is in \"excellent health\" and that the doctor's full letter would be released soon.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the condition, what symptoms it causes and how it's treated.",
      "What is chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a circulatory condition in which the veins in the leg have difficulty returning blood back to the heart due to damaged valves.",
      "\"Unlike the arteries, the veins have valves that help return blood to the heart,\" Dr. Andrea Obi, vascular surgeon at University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center and associate professor of vascular surgery at University of Michigan Medical School, told ABC News.",
      "She explained that there are larger veins, called deep veins, which return the bulk of blood to the heart, and there are superficial veins, which are just under the skin surface.",
      "\"When the valves fail, meaning they don't adequately return blood to the heart, the blood can back up into the leg, and that's essentially what venous insufficiency is,\" Obi said.",
      "This can cause blood to pool in the legs and lead to leg swelling.",
      "CVI is fairly common, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, according to the Society for Vascular Surgery.",
      "Obi said this figure may be an underestimation because CVI is not detected on any routine screening test, and patients often require a duplex ultrasound -- a non-invasive imaging technique to assess blood flow and blood vessel structure -- for diagnosis.",
      "What are the symptoms?",
      "Obi said most CVI patients have mild symptoms and the most common manifestation is varicose veins, which occur when the blood pools into the superficial veins just under the skin.",
      "The veins become swollen, which can be heavy, uncomfortable or painful for patients.",
      "If patients have CVI in the deeper veins, they may experience leg swelling around the ankle area and it can extend up towards the knee, Obi said.",
      "In more severe cases, darkening of the skin can occur and an open sore or ulcer could develop.",
      "\"When the blood pools down near the ankle level, you'll get discoloration, and it's a brown discoloration \u2026 and that brown discoloration is the result of the iron from the red blood cells that sort of pools there and gets picked up by your immune cells,\" Obi said.",
      "Over time, this can make the skin thick and unable to heal from minor trauma, which is when ulcers form, she said.",
      "How is it treated?",
      "Treatments are typically nonsurgical and are mainly to prevent swelling and ulcers from forming, according to the Society for Vascular Surgery.",
      "Obi said if a patient is found to have CVI incidentally and they don't have symptoms, there is no need for treatment unless symptoms arise.",
      "First-line treatment can include compression, such as wearing compression stockings or an elastic wrap. There are also supplements patients can take to relieve symptoms, Obi said.",
      "\"Compression is the very first thing that you prescribe and then, generally, if a patient desires surgical intervention or something like that, you would try compression first to see if they get relief,\" she said. \"If they're still symptomatic or not able to live their daily life, then you might proceed down the pathway of doing an intervention to try and help them improve their quality of life.\"",
      "If superficial veins are affected, patients may receive vein ablation, which is a minimally invasive procedure to close the veins off, and removal of the varicose veins.",
      "If deep veins are affected, some patients may require an angioplasty to widen the narrow or blocked veins, or stenting to restore blood flow.",
      "Obi said even if someone's vein valves are prone to failing due to genetics or aging, walking can help overcome this.",
      "\"Your calf muscle will substitute for your valves, and your calf muscle will actually push the blood back up to your heart,\" she said. \"We tell all our patients, 'You should do some sort of walking program to keep that calf pump strong. The worst thing you can do is stand on your feet for long periods of time and allow the blood to pool.\"",

      "The fugitive father has been on the run for over a month.",
      "As the search for Travis Decker -- the father accused of murdering his three daughters -- reaches well over the one-month mark, video released by police shows the fugitive father three days before he picked up his kids and vanished.",
      "The video, obtained by ABC News from the Wenatchee Police Department, shows Decker in the parking lot of a grocery store in Wenatchee, Washington, after rear-ending another individual's vehicle.",
      "Throughout the 20-minute video, Decker -- seen wearing a white t-shirt and dark shorts -- leans against his white pickup truck, crosses his arms and talks to a police officer and the individual whose car he hit.",
      "Officials described the incident as a fender bender and that Decker would receive a ticket in the mail for \"no insurance and following too closely,\" police said in the incident report.",
      "Before Decker leaves the scene, he shakes the hand of the individual he rear-ended.",
      "This interaction was captured on May 27 -- just three days before Decker picked up his daughters for a planned visit on May 30. Several days later, on June 2, the three girls -- Paityn Decker, 9; Evelyn Decker, 8; and Olivia Decker, 5 -- were found dead near the Rock Island Campground in Chelan County, Washington, police said.",
      "Ever since then, Decker, an Army veteran accused of murdering the three girls, has not been seen since.",
      "Mike Morrison, the Chelan County Sheriff leading the search efforts, told ABC News officials are \"of course frustrated like the rest of our community\" that Decker has not been located.",
      "\"It could be several weeks, several days or years before we find him. But we don't give up, we haven't closed this out. We're still pursuing,\" Morrison said.",
      "While the search efforts have slowed down in the past month, Morrison said the U.S. Marshal Service and the Chelan County Sheriff's Office -- along with partners in Canada -- are the agencies currently partaking in the manhunt for Decker.",
      "But to ensure officials are not \"aimlessly deploying taxpayer dollars,\" Morrison said authorities are leaning more on the investigative side of the case and only searching if credible leads arise -- like the instance in Idaho earlier this month, which turned out not to be Decker. Groups that are training this summer -- specifically search and rescue teams and swift water rescue teams -- will also search for Decker in the Washington area during their already scheduled training times, Morrison said.",
      "After conducting thorough searches of the surrounding land and water -- along with interviewing friends and family members -- Morrison said, \"We just don't have anywhere specifically to go\" to look for Decker. But, he said, they remain \"hopeful\" and are aware that this hunt could be a \"long haul.\"",
      "\"We could be in for a fight for five years, 10 years, 20 years. I certainly hope we're looking at a couple weeks and it closes out, but it could be a long time and we are committed to staying with it,\" Morrison told ABC News.",
      "The Chelan County Sheriff's Office revealed earlier this month that DNA found at the scene of the crime matched the DNA profile \"that we believe is Decker's\" and that they had no \"reason to believe there are any other suspects,\" the sheriff said in a press release at the time.",
      "Morrison confirmed once again that the DNA evidence to ABC News on Wednesday, and also revealed that the non-human blood found at the scene of the crime belonged to Decker's dog, which was recovered \"in good health\" at the scene and was taken to a humane society.",
      "Regardless of when they locate Decker, Morrison said he wants \"closure for the family.\"",
      "\"We want the voices of Peyton, Evelyn and Olivia to be heard,\" Morrison told ABC News.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service is still offering a $20,000 reward for information leading directly to Decker's arrest. He is currently wanted for three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping, police said.",
      "Officials said anyone who has information on Decker or knows of his whereabouts should not attempt to contact him, but instead call 911 or the U.S. Marshals Communication Center immediately.",

      "And experts say consumers shouldn't expect much relief soon either.",
      "The average price of a pound of ground beef rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",
      "But this is not a recent phenomenon. Beef prices have been steadily rising over the past 20 years because the supply of cattle remains tight while beef remains popular.",
      "In fact, the U.S. cattle herd has been steadily shrinking for decades. As of Jan. 1, the U.S. had 86.7 million cattle and calves, down 8% from the most recent peak in 2019. That is the lowest number of cattle since 1951, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Many factors including drought and cattle prices have contributed to that decline. And now the emergence of a pesky parasite in Mexico and the prospect of widespread tariffs may further reduce supply and raise prices.",
      "Here's a look at what's causing the price of beef to rise.",
      "The American beef industry has gotten better at breeding larger animals, so ranchers can provide the same amount of beef with fewer cattle, said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M.",
      "Then in 2020, a three-year drought began that dried out pastures and raised the cost of feed for cattle, according to the American Farm Bureau. Drought has continued to be a problem across the West since then, and the price of feed has put more pressure on ranchers who already operate on slim profit margins.",
      "In response, many farmers slaughtered more female cattle than usual, which helped beef supplies in the short term but lowered the size of future herds. Lower cattle supplies has raised prices.",
      "In recent years cattle prices have soared, so that now animals are selling for thousands of dollars apiece. Recent prices show cattle selling for more than $230 per hundredweight, or hundred pounds.",
      "Those higher prices give ranchers more incentive to sell cows now to capture profits instead of hanging onto them for breeding given that prices in the years ahead may decrease, Anderson said.",
      "\u201cFor them, the balance is, \u2018Do I sell that animal now and take this record high check?\u2019 Or \u2018do I keep her to realize her returns over her productive life when she\u2019s having calves?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s this balancing act and so far the side that\u2019s been winning is to sell her and get the check.\u201d",
      "The emergence of a flesh-eating pest in cattle herds in Mexico has put extra pressure on supply because officials cut off all imports of cattle from south of the border last year. Some 4% of the cattle the U.S. feeds to slaughter for beef comes from Mexico.",
      "The pest is the New World screwworm fly, and female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals. The larvae that hatch are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material. American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses as they did decades ago before the U.S. eradicated the pest.",
      "Agricultural economist Bernt Nelson with the Farm Bureau said the loss of that many cattle is putting additional pressure on supply that is helping drive prices higher.",
      "President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to have a major impact on beef prices but they could be another factor that drives prices higher because the U.S. imports more than 4 million pounds of beef every year.",
      "Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the U.S. to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want. Much of that lean beef comes from Australia and New Zealand that have only seen a 10% tariff, but some of it comes from Brazil where Trump has threatened tariffs as high as 50%.",
      "If the tariffs remain in place long-term, meat processors will have to pay higher prices on imported lean beef. It wouldn't be easy for U.S. producers to replace because the country's system is geared toward producing fattier beef known for marbled steaks.",
      "It's the height of grilling season and demand in the U.S. for beef remains strong, which Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said will help keep prices higher.",
      "If prices remain this high, shoppers will likely start to buy more hamburger meat and fewer steaks, but that doesn't appear to be happening broadly yet \u2014 and people also don't seem to be buying chicken or pork instead of beef.",
      "Nelson said that recently the drought has eased \u2014 allowing pasture conditions to improve \u2014 and grain prices are down thanks to the drop in export demand for corn because of the tariffs. Those factors, combined with the high cattle prices might persuade more ranchers to keep their cows and breed them to expand the size of their herds.",
      "Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. And it wouldn't be clear if that is happening until later this fall when ranchers typically make those decisions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of barriers in the way to grow this herd,\u201d Nelson said. Just consider that a young farmer who wants to add 25 bred heifers to his herd has to be prepared to spend more than $100,000 at auction at a time when borrowing costs remain high.",
      "There is typically a seasonal decline in beef prices as grilling season slows down into the fall, but those price declines are likely to be modest.",

      "If the tariffs remain in place long-term, meat processors will have to pay higher prices on imported lean beef. It wouldn't be easy for U.S. producers to replace because the country's system is geared toward producing fattier beef known for marbled steaks.",
      "It's the height of grilling season and demand in the U.S. for beef remains strong, which Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said will help keep prices higher.",
      "If prices remain this high, shoppers will likely start to buy more hamburger meat and fewer steaks, but that doesn't appear to be happening broadly yet \u2014 and people also don't seem to be buying chicken or pork instead of beef.",
      "Nelson said that recently the drought has eased \u2014 allowing pasture conditions to improve \u2014 and grain prices are down thanks to the drop in export demand for corn because of the tariffs. Those factors, combined with the high cattle prices might persuade more ranchers to keep their cows and breed them to expand the size of their herds.",
      "Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. And it wouldn't be clear if that is happening until later this fall when ranchers typically make those decisions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of barriers in the way to grow this herd,\u201d Nelson said. Just consider that a young farmer who wants to add 25 bred heifers to his herd has to be prepared to spend more than $100,000 at auction at a time when borrowing costs remain high.",
      "There is typically a seasonal decline in beef prices as grilling season slows down into the fall, but those price declines are likely to be modest.",

      "A Wisconsin judge has approved the conditional release of Morgan Geyser, who as a child nearly stabbed a classmate to death to please the fictional horror character Slender Man",
      "A judge has approved a conditional release plan for a Wisconsin woman who nearly killed her classmate years ago to please the fictional horror character Slender Man.",
      "Waukesha County Circuit Judge Scott Wagner signed off Thursday on the plan to release Morgan Geyser, now 22, from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute, a psychiatric hospital where she has spent the last seven years.",
      "In April, prosecutors objected to Geyser\u2019s original conditional release plan after the mother of the victim, Payton Leutner, expressed concern that Geyser\u2019s group home was located eight miles away from Leutner. The judge then ordered the Department of Health Services to draft a new plan, which was approved Thursday. Details of the plan were not shared in court.",
      "Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier, lured Leutner to a Waukesha park after a sleepover in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier egged her on. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.",
      "Geyser and Weier fled after the attack but were arrested as they were walking on Interstate 94. They told investigators they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man\u2019s servants and feared he would hurt their families if they didn\u2019t follow through. They had planned to walk to Slender Man\u2019s mansion in northern Wisconsin after the attack, they said.",
      "Leutner barely survived the attack. Geyser ultimately pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in 2017 but claimed she wasn\u2019t responsible because she was mentally ill. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren committed her to a psychiatric hospital for 40 years in 2018, but the judge ruled in January she could be released after three experts testified she has made progress battling mental illness.",
      "State health officials argued in March that Geyser couldn\u2019t be trusted after learning that she hadn\u2019t told her therapists that she had read a novel about murder and black market organ sales. They also alleged that she had been communicating with a man who collects murder memorabilia and sent him her own sketch of a decapitated body and a postcard saying she wants to be intimate with him.",
      "Cotton countered that Geyser only read what the facility allowed, and staff knew she had been communicating with the collector. He added that she stopped talking to the man in 2024 after she discovered he was selling things she sent him. Bohren concluded that Geyser wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything and ordered state health officials to continue developing a release plan.",
      "Wagner took over Geyser\u2019s release request after Bohren retired this past April.",
      "Weier pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon in 2017, but like Geyser claimed she was mentally ill and not responsible for her actions. She was committed to 25 years in a mental hospital but was granted release in 2021 after agreeing to live with her father and to wear a GPS monitor.",
      "The case has drawn widespread attention in part because of the girls\u2019 fascination with the Slender Man character. Slender Man was created online by Eric Knudson in 2009 as a mysterious specter photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He\u2019s typically depicted as a slim, spidery figure in a black suit with a featureless white face. He has grown into a popular boogeyman and has appeared in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to hire 10,000 employees over five years, echoing a Border Patrol expansion in the 2000s",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- In 2006, top U.S. Border Patrol officials were asked how long it would take to hire 6,000 agents, a roughly 50% increase at the time. Michael Fisher, then deputy chief in San Diego, says the officials concluded they would need five years.",
      "\u201cYou have 2 1/2 years,\u201d Fisher recalls being told.",
      "With Immigration and Customs Enforcement now preparing to add 10,000 employees within five years to assist with President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts, the Border Patrol\u2019s torrid expansion in the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. Hiring and training standards were changed and arrests for employee misconduct rose. Pressure to turbo-charge growth can also lead to attrition.",
      "\"If they don\u2019t uphold pretty rigorous standards and background checks, you can end up hiring the wrong people, and then you pay a huge price in how the public perceives them,\u201d said Gil Kerlikowske, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, from 2014 to 2017.",
      "ICE, the main agency responsible for arresting and deporting people within the U.S., is set to get $76.5 billion, nearly 10 times its annual budget, under a bill Trump signed on July 4. Most of that money is for detention, but some is for hiring and other uses. The White House says ICE will grow from 20,000 employees to about 30,000.",
      "\u201cTo do it today is an effort that needs to start years ago,\u201d said Matthew Hudak, former Border Patrol deputy chief. \u201cThe funding is there, but it is nearly impossible to bring in that many people that quickly because you hit challenges.\"",
      "The Border Patrol nearly doubled its workforce from 11,264 agents in October 2005 to 21,444 agents six years later.",
      "To recruit officers, the agency sponsored a NASCAR race car and bull riding contests. It aired ads during Dallas Cowboys football games. It advertised at military bases. Billboards and job fairs hundreds of miles from the border promised fulfilling careers, resulting in thousands of applications a week.",
      "The agency also loosened some hiring guidelines and training requirements. The age limit for new hires was raised to 40 years old from 37. Spanish language training was cut by up to 30 days, some training was moved online and other instruction was shifted to the field to lessen time at a training academy that the agency opened in Artesia, New Mexico, during the hiring surge, according to a Government Accountability Office report.",
      "Arrests for illegal crossings fell to their lowest levels in decades \u2014 a sign for some that the strategy succeeded.",
      "But other measurements were more troubling.",
      "In 2008, the Border Patrol struggled to keep new agents, with about 20% failing to graduate from the academy and more leaving after returning to their stations.",
      "Arrests of CBP employees for misconduct increased to 336 in the 2012 fiscal year from 190 seven years earlier. The agency saw a spate of high-profile corruption cases, including agents accused of smuggling people across the border or working with drug cartels to bring illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "The polygraph pass rate for new applicants tumbled to 33% in 2012 from 58% four years earlier. While the accuracy of the tests came under scrutiny, one applicant admitted that his brother-in-law, a known Mexican drug smuggler, asked him to use his employment to facilitate cocaine trafficking. Another admitted to using marijuana 9,000 times, including the night before the exam.",
      "A 2015 Homeland Security report found that the number of investigators assigned to internal wrongdoing was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d for the agency\u2019s growth.",
      "\"Any time you have massive political pressure to beef up overnight, it never turns out well,\" said T.J. Bonner, the former president of the Border Patrol agents union who retired in 2011. \"Too many corners have to be cut. Then when things go wrong. the fingers get pointed.\u201d",
      "ICE and Homeland Security did not respond to questions about lessons that the Border Patrol's hiring spree or detailed plans for hiring at ICE.",
      "\u201cThe unprecedented funding for ICE will enable my hard-working officers and agents to continue making America safe again by identifying, arresting and removing criminal aliens from our communities,\u201d Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, said after Trump signed the bill.",
      "Critics say the administration\u2019s policy to target anyone in the country illegally, not just those with criminal records, could lead to abuses. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff and lead architect of his immigration policies, had set an aggressive target of at least 3,000 arrests a day even before any additional hiring.",
      "\u201cWhen there are no priorities, everybody\u2019s a priority,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council. \u201cYou\u2019re very likely to see confusion, delay, wrongful arrest, more mistakes when law enforcement agencies, especially large ones, don\u2019t have clear direction and guidance for prioritization.\u201d",
      "Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said competition for qualified law enforcement is tough, with departments now offering signing bonuses of $10,000 to $100,000.",
      "Border Patrol staffing has yet to return to its peaks of the early 2010s. Trump tried to increase staffing in his first term. A contract with consulting firm Accenture PLC cost $13.6 million to set up in 2018 and resulted in only two hires over 10 months.",
      "Trump's bill allocates about $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement, with $4.1 billion for CBP hiring that includes 3,000 more Border Patrol agents. It comes at a time of historically low crossings after they reached a record high in December 2023.",

      "The Ventura City native was detained during chaotic raids at two Southern California farms where federal authorities arrested more than 360 people, one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office in January.

      "Retes was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where he said he was put in a special cell on suicide watch and checked on each day after he became emotionally distraught over his ordeal and missing his 3-year-old daughter's birthday party Saturday.",

      "Just 1 in 4 U.S. adults say President Donald Trump\u2019s policies have helped them",
      "WASHINGTON -- Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults say that President Donald Trump's policies have helped them since he took office, according to a new poll that finds underwhelming marks for him on key issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care.",
      "In fact, the Republican president fails to earn majority approval on any of the issues included in the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. He's even slipped slightly since earlier this year on immigration, which has consistently been a strength for him in his second term.",
      "And while a majority of Americans do see Trump as at least \u201csomewhat\u201d capable of getting things done following the passage of his sprawling budget bill, fewer believe he understands the problems facing people like them.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults report that Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cdone more to hurt\u201d them since his second term began six months ago, the survey found. About 2 in 10 say his policies have \u201cnot made a difference\u201d in their lives, with about one-quarter saying his policies have \"done more to help\u201d them.",
      "The vast majority of Democrats and about half of independents say Trump\u2019s policies have had a negative impact, while even many Republicans say they haven't seen positive effects.",
      "\u201cAs it sits today, I don\u2019t know his policies have made much of a difference in my day-to-day life,\u201d said Landon Lindemer, a 29-year-old logistics manager from suburban Atlanta who voted for Trump three times.",
      "Lindemer said he generally approves of Trump's job performance, even if he has concerns about the massive spending in the big bill the president signed into law on July 4.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sold it\u2019s really going to help,\" he said.",
      "The mixed reviews on Trump's policies come as he struggles to follow through on key campaign promises, including lowering costs for working-class Americans, preserving popular social welfare programs like Medicaid, ending foreign wars and lowering government spending.",
      "Inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the cost of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Separately, Trump\u2019s budget bill included Medicaid cuts that will lead to 11.8 million more Americans becoming uninsured and add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.",
      "At the same time, violent conflicts still rage in Israel and Ukraine.",
      "Overall, the new poll finds that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump's job performance, a figure that's in line with his June approval but historically weak compared with recent presidents. Closer to half of U.S. adults approved of President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama at roughly the same point in their Democratic presidencies, according to polls from AP-NORC and Gallup, although Biden's approval rating declined in the second half of his first year and remained low for the rest of his time in office.",
      "Poll respondent Bailey Neill, a 42-year-old attorney from San Antonio, said he was \u201cterrified\u201d of Trump.",
      "Neill, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cstudent of history,\u201d cast Trump as an authoritarian who has followed the controversial playbook outlined in Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for transformative changes across the federal government that Trump tried to distance himself from before the November election.",
      "\u201cIn terms of my day-to-day life, I really haven\u2019t seen a change, except for the general fear and anxiety I feel at a core level,\u201d Neill said.",
      "Trump earned less than 50% approval on every issue included in the new AP-NORC poll, including the economy, government spending, trade, taxes, immigration, health care and his handling of the conflict in the Middle East.",
      "Only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.",
      "Trump also appears to have lost some support for his spending decisions. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of Trump's handling of government spending, down from 46% in March.",
      "On the economy overall, roughly 4 in 10 adults approve of Trump's performance, which hasn't changed measurably in the last few months.",
      "Timothy Dwyer, of Dyersburg, Tennessee, a 26-year-old self-described independent who works in retail sales and leans Republican, said Trump's work on the economy, especially his tariffs, has \u201creally sucked.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s turned us into a toilet and has absolutely made us the laughing stock of the world,\u201d Dwyer said of Trump's trade policies, while also lamenting the president's work on reducing grocery prices and health care.",
      "Despite such criticism, most U.S. adults think Trump is at least somewhat effective.",
      "About 6 in 10 say \u201ccapable of getting things done\u201d describes Trump at least \u201csomewhat\u201d well. And about half of U.S. adults say the same about the phrases \u201cgood negotiator\u201d or \u201ccapable of handling a crisis.\"",

    "story": [
      "A spokesman for Camp Mystic, the Texas enclave devastated by a July 4 flash flood, is raising concerns about communication failures during the disaster",
      "The leader of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather before the deadly Texas floods, but it is now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesman for camp\u2019s operators said Wednesday.",
      "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, began taking action after more than 2 inches of rain had fallen in the area along the Guadalupe River, said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the family and the camp. He said Eastland had a \u201chome weather station\u201d and was monitoring the rain on July 4.",
      "But after initially portraying to the media this week that Eastland got the weather alerts about a flash flood, Carr told The Associated Press that critical moment in the timeline of the tragedy isn\u2019t as clear as the family and staff first thought. No one in the family or camp staff, Carr said, could now say whether Eastland got the alert at 1:14 a.m.",
      "\u201cIt was assumed that just because he had a cellphone on and shortly after that alert, he was calling his family on the walkie-talkies saying, \u2018Hey, we got two inches in the last hour. We need to get the canoes up. We got things to do,' \u201d Carr said.",
      "The new account by the family comes as Camp Mystic staff has come under scrutiny of their actions, what preventive measures were taken and the camp's emergency plan leading up to a during the catastrophic flood that has killed at least 132 people.",
      "The flash-flood warning that the National Weather Service issued at 1:14 a.m. on July 4 for Kerr County triggered an emergency alerts to broadcast outlets, weather radios and mobile phones. It warned of \u201ca dangerous and life-threatening situation.\u201d The weather service extended the warning at 3:35 a.m. and escalated it to flash-flood emergency at 4:03 a.m.",
      "Eastland died while trying to rescue girls and was found in his Tahoe that was swept away by the floodwaters, Carr said.",
      "Even without a storm, the cellphone coverage at Camp Mystic is spotty at best, so campers and staff turn on their Wi-Fi, Carr said. He called ridiculous criticism that Eastland waited too long before beginning to evacuate the campers, which he said appears to have begun sometime between 2 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.",
      "\u201cCommunication was a huge deficiency,\u201d Carr said. \"This community was hamstrung, nobody could communicate. The first responder, the first rescue personnel that showed up was a game warden.\u201d",
      "According to Carr, Eastland and others started evacuating girls from cabins nearest the overflowing river and moved them to the camp's two-story recreation hall. Of the 10 cabins closest to the river, the recreation hall is the furthest at 865 feet (264 meters) with the closest cabin about 315 feet (96 meters), according to an Associated Press analysis of aerial imagery.",
      "To reach Senior Hill, which was on higher ground , they would have had to cross an overflowing creek, Carr said. At times the young campers were climbing hills in bare feet, he said.",
      "Some of the camp\u2019s buildings \u2014 which flooded \u2014 were in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency considered a 100-year flood plain. But in response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county\u2019s flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area. Carr said there were \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons for filing appeals and suggested that the maps may not always be accurate.",
      "Just before daybreak on the Fourth of July, destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. Crews in helicopters, boats and drones have been searching for victims.",
      "Officials say 97 people in the Kerrville area may still be missing.",

      "President Donald Trump will not recommend a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will not recommend a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, a White House spokeswoman said Thursday, turning aside calls for further action in an inquiry that has roiled the Justice Department and angered supporters who had been expecting a treasure trove of documents from the case.",
      "The rejection of a special counsel is part of an effort by the White House to turn the page from continued outrage from corners of Trump's base over the Justice Department's refusal last week to release additional records from the investigation into Epstein, a well-connected and wealthy financier who killed himself in jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Officials also said Epstein did not maintain a much-hyped \u201cclient list\u201d and said the evidence was clear he had died by suicide despite conspiracy theories to the contrary.",
      "Trump on Wednesday sought to clamp down on criticism from his own supporters about his administration's handling of the Epstein-related records, calling them \u201cweaklings\" who were being duped and characterizing the investigation as a \u201choax\" \u2014 even though his hand-picked leaders at the FBI and Justice Department had long stoked public expectations that important information was being hidden.",
      "The news organization Just the News published excerpts Wednesday from a Trump interview in which Trump said he would be open to having a special counsel look into \u201canything credible\u201d related to Epstein, as well as other long-standing grievances he and his supporters have long raised.",
      "But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to close the door Thursday on a special counsel for the Epstein investigation, saying \"the idea was floated from someone in the media to the president.\u201d",
      "\"The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case,\u201d she said.",
      "Justice Department regulations allow for the attorney general to appoint and supervise an outside special counsel to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing in instances when prosecutors might face a potential or perceived conflict of interest.",
      "The department in recent years has appointed a succession of special counsels \u2014 sometimes, though not always, plucked from outside the agency \u2014 to lead investigations into politically sensitive matters, including into conduct by President Joe Biden and by Trump.",
      "Last year, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers launched an aggressive, and successful, challenge to the appointment of Jack Smith, the special counsel assigned to investigate his efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "A Trump-appointed judge agreed, ruling that then-Attorney General Merrick Garland had exceeded his bounds by appointing a prosecutor without Senate approval and confirmation, and dismissed the case.",
      "That legal team included Todd Blanche, who is now deputy attorney general, as well as Emil Bove, who is Blanche\u2019s top deputy but was recently nominated to serve as a judge on a federal appeals court.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- With record temperatures hitting the U.S., pet owners have to protect their four-legged family members from dangers like heat stroke and dehydration.",
      "But keeping an animal the size of a small car cool isn\u2019t as easy as bringing it inside to the air conditioning. That\u2019s why Alicia Grace, owner of Pink Flamingo Stables, has to take extra steps to keep her horses safe and healthy in South Florida\u2019s hot and humid climate.",
      "Grace cares for eight full-size horses and three ponies on her Lake Worth Beach property. South Florida has a large equestrian community, especially in Palm Beach County with the National Polo Center located in Wellington. But the climate isn\u2019t ideal for horses, which generally do better in drier, cooler environments, Grace said.",
      "\u201cNot only do we have the heat, but we also have all the humidity,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAnd with that comes the bugs \u2014 flies and mosquitoes \u2014 which can actually breed in their cuts and cause all sorts of issues.\u201d",
      "Grace said it\u2019s important to keep the horses hydrated and out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day. All paddocks have shaded areas, and barns are equipped with large fans.",
      "\u201cThey always have constant access to water,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe bathe them daily, and we have cooling blankets that you can actually put on after a ride.\u201d",
      "While cats and dogs can be brought inside to cool, conditioned air on especially hot days, that\u2019s not as easy for horses and other large animals.",
      "\u201cThey actually do now make air conditioning units for horses, but they are quite expensive,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIt is definitely a different animal and definitely requires a lot more care.\u201d",
      "Besides concerns about overheating or dehydration, horses are also vulnerable to algae and fungus that thrive in the South Florida climate.",
      "\u201cWe get a lot of flooding during our rainy season, and if the horses are out in that and their hooves get saturated, they can get abscesses, which are pus pockets, and get a lot of problems with their feet,\u201d Grace said.",
      "Cats, dogs and other house pets are easier to keep cool, but pet owners still have to remain vigilant during the summer, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control spokeswoman Arielle Weinberger said. Just like horses, any cats and dogs kept outside need shade and water.",
      "Officials are especially concerned about pet owners leaving dogs and cats inside vehicles. Local laws might vary throughout the state, but it's illegal to leave animals unattended in vehicles for any amount of time in Palm Beach County, Weinberger said. During hot weather, she said the temperature inside a vehicle can increase 20 degrees in just 10 minutes.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that no animals are left unattended, and that includes even if the window is cracked, even if the A/C is on,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cAnimals cannot be unattended in a vehicle, it is for their safety.\u201d",
      "Dog owners especially need to check pavement, Weinberger said. Concrete and asphalt can reach temperatures of up to 125 degrees (52 degrees) during the summer months, so finding grass or dirt for pets to walk on is ideal. If that's not practical, pet owners might need to invest in booties or paw wax.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too hot for you to touch with a bare foot or a bare hand, it\u2019s too hot for your pets, as well,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "People who don't actually own pets can also help to keep animals safe, whether it's community cats or local wildlife, by leaving water outside, Weinberger said. Animal control officers will respond to pets and livestock suffering from signs of dehydration or heat stroke, but Weinberger said residents should call local wildlife rescue facilities if they see a raccoon or other wild animal in bad shape.",
      "If an animal seems overheated, it can be cooled down with water on their head, stomach and feet. But if they start to experience symptoms like diarrhea, lethargy, dizziness and vomiting, it's time to seek medical attention, Weinberger said.",
      "\u201cWe want to take them to the vet as soon as possible, because heat stroke can lead to organ failure, and we want to make sure that it doesn\u2019t get to that,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "Matthew Puodziukaitis, 19, of Wellington, regularly brings his mini goldendoodle, Hazel, to the Okeeheelee Park dog area. He said he always brings a bottle of cold water and a bowl for Hazel and any other dogs who might need it.",
      "\"The last thing you want is a dog passing out or something bad happening to them out here,\" Puodziukaitis said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically like a little kid. You want to make sure they\u2019re okay.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials will allow Juul to keep selling its electronic cigarettes",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is allowing vaping brand Juul to keep its e-cigarettes on the market, providing relief to a company that has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "FDA regulators said Thursday that studies from Juul show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\u201cThis is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\u201d Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Parents, politicians and antitobacco groups are certain to oppose FDA\u2019s decision. They have argued for years that Juul should be permanently banned from selling its products due to its role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping",
      "Juul was once valued at over $13 billion and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul\u2019s application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "Juul said that regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Thursday\u2019s announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original product, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to FDA for more flavors.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on traditional cigarettes, while rejecting more than a million other vaping products that failed to meet agency standards. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their e-cigarettes benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced earlier brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored vape cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company\u2019s rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. high schools and middle schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored cartridges for its device.",
      "By then the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by Congress, state and local officials and class action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company has separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits with most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by Reynolds American.",
      "Teens have also shifted away from the brand amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal survey. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

      "Legal advocates have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to restore deportation protection for migrant children and youth who suffered parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment",
      "Attorneys representing migrant children who were abused, neglected or abandoned by a parent asked a federal court on Thursday to restore their deportation protections after the Trump administration ended them.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, was filed on behalf of nine young people and their legal advocates who want a judge to keep the protections for up to nearly 150,000 beneficiaries.",
      "\u201cThese young people have survived abuse, abandonment, and neglect only to be retraumatized now by the constant threat of detention and deportation from the same agencies that vowed to keep them safe,\" said Rachel Davidson, plaintiff attorney with the National Immigration Project.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services were both named in the lawsuit. USCIS Spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said, \u201cAs a matter of practice, USCIS does not comment on pending litigation.\u201d DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Migrant children who suffered parental abuse, neglect or abandonment are designated through state courts and the federal government with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, which was created by Congress in 1990 with bipartisan support.",
      "SIJS, as it is known, does not grant legal status. But it lets qualifying young people apply for a visa to become legal permanent residents and obtain a work permit. It can take years for a visa to become available due to annual caps. In 2022, the Biden administration allowed children to be shielded from deportation while waiting for a visa.",
      "In June, the Trump administration ended deportation protection for SIJS beneficiaries. Without it, they can still wait in the U.S. for a visa but cannot receive work authorization. And if they are deported while they are waiting, they will no longer be eligible to become legal permanent residents.",
      "Though overshadowed by higher-profile moves to end birthright citizenship and halt asylum at the border, the policy shift is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration system overhaul intended to make it more difficult for people to legally remain in the U.S.",
      "A Guatemalan teen who is living in New York and living with her older brother is one of the plaintiffs. She said through attorneys, who omit using the names of minors, that her dreams of becoming an astronaut one day may be cut short if she's unable to continue high school for fear of deportation.",
      "\u201cI felt that I was finally in a safe environment, but if I had to return to (Guatemala), I would be very afraid of the violence and abuse from my mother and father,\u201d she said in a statement shared by the attorneys without her name.",
      "The policy shift may shut down a legal pathway to possible citizenship for nearly 150,000 migrants who attorneys estimate have received this classification and are stuck in the visa backlog.",
      "It could keep them from obtaining Social Security cards, driver\u2019s licenses, medical treatment, health insurance, higher education, bank accounts, and, for older youth, legal and safe employment opportunities.",

      "Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration\u2019s secretive third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration's third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time, a government spokesperson said.",
      "Thabile Mdluli, the spokesperson, declined to identify the correctional facility or facilities where the five men are, citing security concerns. She said Eswatini planned to ultimately repatriate the five to their home countries with the help of a United Nations agency.",
      "In cell phone messages to The Associated Press on Thursday, Mdluli said it wasn't clear how long that would take.",
      "The men, who the U.S. says were convicted of serious crimes and were in the U.S. illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos. Their convictions included murder and child rape, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said, describing them as \"uniquely barbaric.\"",
      "Their deportations were announced by Homeland Security on Tuesday and mark the continuation of President Donald Trump's plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it was stalled by a legal challenge in the United States.",
      "Here's what we know and don't know about the deportations:",
      "Eswatini, a country of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa, is the latest nation to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, and deported eight men earlier this month to South Sudan, also an African country.",
      "The deportees to South Sudan are citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan. They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in the nearby country of Djibouti until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for them to be finally sent to South Sudan. The U.S. also described them as violent criminals.",
      "Eswatini's government confirmed on Wednesday that the latest five deportees were in its custody after landing on a deportation plane from the U.S.",
      "Local media reported they are being held at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, outside the country's administrative capital of Mbabane, which includes Eswatini's top maximum-security prison.",
      "The Eswatini government said the men are \u201cin transit\u201d and will eventually be sent to their home countries. The U.S. and Eswatini governments would work with the U.N. migration agency to do that, it said.",
      "The U.N. agency \u2014 the International Organization for Migration or IOM \u2014 said it was not involved in the operation and has not been approached to assist in the matter but would be willing to help \u201cin line with its humanitarian mandate.\u201d",
      "Eswatini's statement that the men would be sent home was in contrast to U.S. claims they were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to take them back.",
      "It's unclear how sending the men to Eswatini would make it easier for them to be deported home. There was also no timeframe for that as it depends on several factors, including engagements with the IOM, Mdluli said.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to determine the timelines for the repatriation,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Four of the five countries where the men are from have historically resisted taking back some of their citizens deported from the U.S., which has been a reoccurring problem for Homeland Security. Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration was happy the men were \u201coff of American soil\u201d when she announced their deportations.",
      "There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said \"the terms of the agreement between the U.S. and Eswatini remain classified.\u201d",
      "Eswatini has said it was the result of months of negotiations between the two governments. South Sudan has also given no details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees and has declined to say where the eight men sent there are being held.",
      "Some analysts say African nations might be willing to take deportees from the U.S. in return for more favorable relations with the Trump administration, which has cut foreign aid to poor countries and threatened them with trade tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it's seeking more deportation deals with other countries.",
      "Rights groups have questioned the countries the U.S. has chosen to deal with, as South Sudan and Eswatini have both been criticized for having repressive governments.",
      "Eswatini is Africa's only absolute monarchy, meaning the king has power over government and rules by decree. Political parties are banned and pro-democracy protests have been quelled violently in the past.",
      "Several rights groups have criticized Eswatini since pro-democracy protests erupted there in 2021, citing deadly crackdowns by security forces and abusive conditions in prisons, including at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, where pro-democracy activists are held.",

      "During a hearing Thursday morning, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler agreed that lifting the gag order would protect the First Amendment rights of the public and press.",
      "\u201cThe primary purpose of the non-dissemination order, which is to ensure that we can seat an impartial jury, is no longer at play,\u201d Hippler said. He said he couldn\u2019t not justify continuing the gag order because the public has the right to receive information about the case, and those rights are \u201cparamount.\u201d",
      "A different judge in Moscow, Idaho, originally issued the gag order early in the case, saying additional publicity could harm Kohberger\u2019s right to a fair trial.",

      "Prosecutors said he spent months carefully planning the attack, and that his studies as a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University helped him take steps to cover up his tracks.",

      "Brett Hankison is the only officer who fired his weapon the night of the March 2020 botched drug raid who has faced criminal charges. His shots didn't hit or injure anyone, though they flew through Taylor's walls into a neighboring apartment.",
      "A federal judge will decide Hankison's sentence, which could amount to several years, on Tuesday at a hearing. If the judge heeds the Justice Department's request, it would mean that none of the Louisville police officers involved in the botched raid would face any prison time.",

      "Prosecutors at his previous federal trials aggressively pursued a conviction against Hankison, arguing that he blindly fired 10 shots into Taylor's windows without identifying a target.

      "President Donald Trump is countering criticism of the Justice Department\u2019s failure to release much-hyped records around the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, trying to place blame on former government officials.",
      "On Tuesday, he accused former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as former FBI Director James Comey, of making up such documents.",
      "\u201cI would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden ... ,\u201d Trump told members of the press at the White House before departing for an event in Pennsylvania.",
      "The president on Wednesday posted on Truth Social blaming Democrats in general for a \u201cnew SCAM\u201d that \u201cwe will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\u201d",
      "Epstein was arrested in 2019 and found dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York City about a month later. Investigators concluded that he killed himself.",
      "Trump presented no evidence in claiming that Democrats and Comey tampered with documents related to Epstein\u2019s case. Comey was fired in 2017, two years before Epstein\u2019s arrest, and has not returned to the government since. Obama was long gone from the White House by the time of Epstein\u2019s death. During Biden\u2019s presidency, the Justice Department put on trial Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and secured a conviction against her, but there is zero indication that he or anyone from the White House had anything at any point to do with that case.",
      "Comey was a Republican for most of his adult life, but said in 2016 that he was that he was no longer registered with the party.",
      "Trump suggested last year that he was considering releasing information about the Epstein case if he won a second term. In February, the Justice Department released some government documents regarding the case, but there were no new revelations. Then, earlier this month, it acknowledged that a months-long review of additional evidence in the government\u2019s possession had not revealed a list of clients and said no more files related to the case \u2014 other than a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself \u2014 would be made public. The announcement led to outcry from Trump supporters.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared to intimate in a Fox News interview in February that a client list was \u201csitting on my desk\u201d to be reviewed for release. She said last week that she was referring to the Epstein case file generally, as opposed to an actual client list. Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino then had a contentious conversation at the White House as backlash grew to the Justice Department\u2019s decision to withhold records.",
      "Trump, members of his administration and conservative influencers have spread unsubstantiated claims surrounding Epstein for years. Conspiracy theories about Epstein\u2019s death are a popular trope in right-wing spheres, playing on Trump\u2019s repeated promises to reveal and dismantle the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 a supposed secret network of powerful people manipulating government decisions behind the scenes.",
      "Trump\u2019s rivals have recently taken advantage of right-wing fissures over Epstein. Several Democratic lawmakers are calling for the release of all Epstein files and suggesting Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them. ___",

      "Twenty Democratic-led states have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency over the cancellation of a disaster mitigation grant program",
      "Twenty Democratic-led states filed suit Wednesday against the Federal Emergency Management Agency, challenging the elimination of a long-running grant program that helps communities guard against damage from natural disasters.",
      "The lawsuit contends President Donald Trump's administration acted illegally when it announced in April that it was ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. FEMA canceled some projects already in the works and refused to approve new ones despite funding from Congress.",
      "\u201cIn the wake of devastating flooding in Texas and other states, it\u2019s clear just how critical federal resources are in helping states prepare for and respond to natural disasters,\u201d said Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, where the federal lawsuit was filed. \"By abruptly and unlawfully shutting down the BRIC program, this administration is abandoning states and local communities that rely on federal funding to protect their residents and, in the event of disaster, save lives.\u201d",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. It said in April that the program was \u201cwasteful and ineffective\u201d and \u201cmore concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\u201d",
      "The program, established by a 2000 law, provides grants for a variety of disaster mitigation efforts, including levees to protect against floods, safe rooms to provide shelter from tornadoes, vegetation management to reduce damage from fires and seismic retrofitting to fortify buildings for earthquakes.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed a law shoring up funding for disaster risk reduction efforts. The program then got a $1 billion boost from an infrastructure law signed by former President Joe Biden. That law requires FEMA to make available at least $200 million annually for disaster mitigation grants for the 2022-2026 fiscal years, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit contends the Trump administration violated the constitutional separation of powers because Congress had not authorized the program\u2019s demise. It also alleges the program's termination was illegal because the decision was made while FEMA was under the leadership of an acting administrator who had not met the requirements to be in charge of the agency.",
      "The lawsuit says communities in every state have benefited from federal disaster mitigation grants, which saved lives and spared homes, businesses, hospitals and schools from costly damage.",
      "Some communities have already been affected by the decision to end the program.",
      "Hillsborough, North Carolina, had been awarded nearly $7 million to relocate a wastewater pumping station out of a flood plain and make other water and sewer system improvements. But that hadn't happened yet when the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal damaged the pumping station and forced it offline last week.",
      "In rural Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, town officials had hoped to use more than $4 million from the BRIC program to improve stormwater drainage and safeguard a vulnerable electric system, thus protecting investments in a historic theater and other businesses. While the community largely supports Trump, assistant town manager Erin Burris said people were blindsided by the lost funding they had spent years pursuing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had downtown property owners saying, \u2018What do we do?\u2019\u201d Burris said. \u201cI\u2019ve got engineering plans ready to go and I don\u2019t have the money to do it.\u201d",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggests changes to the amount of liquids travelers can carry on planes may be coming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Travelers giddy about being able to keep their shoes on while walking through TSA checkpoints at the airport again may have something else to look forward to: changes to how much liquid they can carry.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday during a conference hosted by \u201cThe Hill\u201d that she is questioning \u201ceverything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\u201d",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Under the Transportation and Security Administration's current guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag. Those containers must be placed in a one-quart resealable plastic bag. Bigger containers must go in checked baggage, though there are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "Noem announced on July 8 that travelers were no longer required to take their shoes off while going through screening after a pilot program showed TSA had the equipment needed to keep airports and aircraft safe while allowing people to keep their shoes on.",
      "That policy had been in place since 2006, several years after \u201cshoe bomber\u201d Richard Reid\u2019s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001.",
      "The limits on liquids were triggered by a 2006 incident where authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIt takes you one minute.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "The new \"Superman\" film has soared to the top of the box office. It made a $122 million domestically in its\u00a0debut over the weekend.",
      "James Gunn, the director of the movie, has worked on the film for the past three years.",
      "\"Then the movie is released and you're like, 'is the public gonna like it? Are the critics gonna like it? And is it gonna make money?' Fortunately with this one, it went well on all three of those,\" Gunn told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The movie depicts Superman, while still powerful, as more human. An initial image shows him bloodied in the snow. Actor David Corenswet plays Superman in the film.",
      "\"As a child, the reason I liked Batman better than Superman was because Superman was just too strong at times,\" Gunn explained. \"I think that this is, we're building a whole universe of characters and I didn't want to have one guy who was so much stronger than anybody else that, you know, a guy with a bow and arrow didn't matter.\"",
      "Gunn also dove into Superman's relationship with Lois Lane, played by Rachel Brosnahan, saying Lane was more cynical and less idealistic than Superman.",
      "\"Lois is a journalist to her core and \u2026 what's her high key value? It's truth. What's Superman's key value? It's life. \u2026 Those are two really important things, but they aren't always, you know, they don't always go together so well,\" he said.",
      "Gunn also delved into Superman's status as an immigrant, its impact and the importance of kindness.",
      "\"For me, the center of it was about kindness in a world that isn't kind. There's no doubt that this story was created by the children of immigrants by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938.\"",
      "He used an example from the film where Superman shows compassion for the character, Lex Luthor, comparing it to everyday life, \"No matter what our beliefs are, if Superman can show Lex Luthor kindness, the guy who wants nothing more than to kill him, why can't we do it to a neighbor who has a different set of political beliefs than we do.\"",

      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",
      "An international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.",
      "But he worked his way onto a Soviet factory ship in the Bering Sea and somehow charmed the captain. Smith's brief stay aboard the Sulak, out of Vladivostok. became the basis of his sequel to \"Gorky Park,\" \"Polar Star.\"",

      "Smith worked to keep himself interested as a writer because, he said, \"writing is so boring. I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you. So, you know, if you aren't really fascinated by it, it's not going to happen.\"",
      "He abandoned his Russian hero for long periods over the years to tackle other characters and settings (including in \"Stallion Gate,\" \"Rose,\" and \"The Girl From Venice\"), but kept going back, in part to reflect on the changes in Russia between Brezhnev and Putin. While he was preparing for the release of his \"December 6\" \u2014 a non-Renko novel set in Tokyo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \u2014 Smith said he could feel the presence of his most famous character lurking over his shoulder: \"You know, I can feel him sort of pacing; you know, smoking cigarettes and pacing \u2026 'When is he going to be done with this Japanese book and we can get back to work?'\""

    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",

      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

    "summary": "Arkansas State Sen. Bryan King has been trying to repeal a 2011 mandate that added fluoride to most public drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",
      "The EPA in 2011\u00a0lowered\u00a0the recommended limit for fluoride in water to cut down on fluorosis \u2014 when spots appear on kids' teeth \u2014 and in the wake of a 2006\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Academy of Sciences that found a lifetime of overconsumption of fluoride can lead to weakened, brittle bones and teeth.",
      "At Arkansas' Fort Smith water system, Lance McAvoy, who oversees the system, told CBS News it's monitored 24/7.",
      "\"We actually take samples every 15 minutes to verify the online equipment,\" McAvoy said, adding there had never been an instance of significantly higher fluoride levels to date.",
      "Dentists such as Kenton Ross, who also serves as president of Arkansas' dental association, say the science supporting fluoride is indisputable.",
      "\"You're gonna see a 25% reduction in tooth decay,\" Ross said of adding fluoride to drinking water. \"We have over 75 years of research over community fluoridation.\"",
      "For dentists, losing fluoride could mean losing the battle against tooth decay.",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested that changes might be coming to the rules limiting liquids in carry on-bags.",
    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:39:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins are a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill regulating the digital currency .",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",

The\u00a0average retirement age\u00a0in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits.",
      "The longer a person waits to claim Social Security, the higher benefit they'll receive from the program. The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks.",
      "Among the 23% in the F&G study who plan to delay claims on their Social Security benefits, half cited financial uncertainties or economic volatility as the reason for their decision to delay retirement \u2014 a 10% increase from last year. Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn.",
      "They're not the only ones, according to David John, a senior policy adviser at AARP.\u00a0 The majority of Americans nearing retirement age are unsure of whether they will have enough money to make it through retirement as they fret over inflation and general economy uncertainty, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Along those lines, Johns said he's also observed that people are cutting back on their retirement savings or pulling money out of retirement savings to deal with unexpected costs or inflationary pressures.",
      "\"Of course, that helps in the short run, but that means that you have even more people who have worries once they start to get to retirement,\" he said.",
      "Unlike 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Social Security benefits are protected from inflation because the agency institutes a cost-of-living adjustment each year, John pointed out. To guard against disruptions to retirement plans, John suggests that people consistently put away money \u2014 even if it's just a small amount each month.",
      "\"Save and continue to save,\" he said. \"Because any amount of retirement savings is going to be better than no retirement savings.\"",

    "summary": "New legal documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein's former net worth and how he amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released legal documents are renewing the focus on Jeffrey Epstein, with public scrutiny of the court papers reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The roughly 60 documents released as of Thursday mostly mention names already known. In fact, the judge who made the call last month to release the information said she was doing so largely because much of it was already public.",
      "Still, the plan to make the papers public fueled rumors that they contained a list of clients or co-conspirators, and misinformation about their content continues to run rampant on social media, the Associated Press reported.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has also proved politically sensitive\u00a0after President Trump returned to office in January of 2025.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank last year. Payouts are expected to be made to nearly 200 women.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

      "The park was built on what was once orange groves in Anaheim, just outside Los Angeles. It opened on July 17, 1955 \u2014 a year that also saw Ray Kroc start his first McDonald's restaurant and Jim Henson introduce his original version of Kermit the Frog.",
      "Disneyland's first day was famously a disaster, all broadcast on a live television special. The park opened just a year after its groundbreaking and simply wasn't ready for its big day.",
      "Attractions broke down, there weren't enough restrooms, food and drinks were in short supply, traffic backed up for miles and the shoes of the first guests sank into freshly paved asphalt.",

    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "Beside them are used electric vehicle batteries under white plastic, whose job is to keep two data centers for Crusoe, an artificial intelligence cloud platform, running day and night.",
      "\"The whole AI industry is struggling with how to access more reliable power on a fast time scale,\" Cully Cavness, co-founder, president and chief operating officer of Crusoe, told CBS News.",
      "That struggle is real. As the use of AI grows, a 2024 Department of Energy study found that U.S. data centers could swallow up to 12% of all U.S. electricity use by\u202f2028, approximately triple today's share.",
      "In Texas alone, developers have filed plans for more than 100 new gas-fired plants, mostly for servers.",
      "\"Gas power is a great solution that data centers are turning to for speed, for speed to megawatts. This is an alternative way to accomplish that speed, but with a renewable power source,\" said Cavness on why he believes that recycled EV batteries offer a solution that gas power does not.",
      "The recycled batteries powering Crusoe's two data centers come from Nevada-based Redwood Materials. The company said it recovered more than 20 gigawatt hours of lithium-ion batteries in 2024, enough to power 250,000 new electric vehicles.",

Maybe your electric vehicle's a little bit slower. And so that's appropriate that you don't want it in your car anymore. But it still works great. So we just looked at that and we were like, 'Hey, why don't we use it to store energy for the grid?'\"",
      "The Redwood Materials engineers kept the system simple: no pipes and no pumps.",
      "\"That's been a fun engineering effort for the engineering team to make something that is robust, that is incredibly useful, but also very cheap and quick to put in the field,\" Campbell said.",

This is very modular.\"",

      "\"I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,\" he said.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump made the comments to the Republican House members in the Oval Office on Tuesday night, after they blocked a procedural vote that would have advanced cryptocurrency legislation in the House favored by Mr. Trump.",
      "The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested\u00a0\u2014 federal law says the chair can only be fired \"for cause.\" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets.",
      "Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, \"Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding.\"",
      "\"I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,\" Mr. Trump said. He added there are \"many people\" who want the chair role.",
      "Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an \"ostentatious\" yearslong office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\"",
      "Sources inside the administration told CBS News the president has been socializing the possibility of a for-cause firing in public and private remarks, but the White House has not yet formally built a legal predicate.",
      "The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters \u2014 an allegation Powell has pushed back on.",
      "For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians.",
      "Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, \"Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source.\"",
      "In a later post, she wrote, \"I'm 99% sure firing is imminent.\"",
      "Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment.",

      "But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell \u2014 who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump \u2014 \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "\"I think he's terrible,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. \"You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a \u2014 nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality.\"",
      "\"I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,\" he said, referring to the building renovation.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,\" the president said June 12.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike.",
      "Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and a \"numbskull\" in a Truth Social post last month.",
      "Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022.",
      "A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",

Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay a $5.1 billion penalty to settle FTC charges. The social media giant also faced significant fines in Europe and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users. Now shareholders want Zuckerberg and others to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine and other legal costs, which the plaintiffs estimate total more than $8 billion.",

      "\"Facebook's privacy disclosures were misleading,\" said Richards, a professor at Washington University Law School.",
      "In later testimony, Jeffrey Zients, who served on Facebook's board from 2018 to 2020, testified that consumer privacy and user data were priorities for both management and the board.",
      "Nonetheless, he supported settling with the FTC as it investigated potential violations of the 2012 consent order, so the company could move forward.",
      "\"It was difficult because this was a lot of money, but I think it was better than the alternative,\" Zients said.",
      "Asked if the board considered making its founder a party to the settlement, he said Zuckerberg was \"essential\" to running the company.",

Other witnesses expected in Delaware Chancery Court, where Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is incorporated, include board member Marc Andreessen and former board member Peter Thiel. The judge is not expected to rule for several months.",

      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",

      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites.

    "summary": "The latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development.",
    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",

      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",

      "Bondi toured Alcatraz, currently part of the National Park Service, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, arriving on a Coast Guard vessel. They were joined by a contingent of administration officials and Secret Service staffers who walked in the chilly bay air among the crumbling buildings, many dating back to the late 19th century.",

      "Trump administration's push to reopen Alcatraz",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",

      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, 6 were shot and killed during their escape, and 2 drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service and the city.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

    "summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official, to serve as a federal circuit judge.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.",
      "The GOP-led panel voted 12-0 to favorably report Bove's nomination to the full Senate, surmounting a key hurdle amid staunch opposition from a host of former federal prosecutors and judges, as well as allegations of unethical conduct by a Justice Department whistleblower.",
      "But as Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley called Bove's nomination for the vote, Democrats erupted in protest because not all were allowed to speak. Grassley also refused to consider a motion by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to delay consideration of Bove's nomination and allow the whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, to testify before senators.",
      "All Democratic members of the committee then left the meeting. Grassley and Republicans continued to tick through nominations, including Bove's, while Booker criticized his GOP colleagues before joining his fellow Democrats in walking out.",
      "\"This lacks decency. It lacks decorum. It shows that you do not simply want to hear from your colleagues. It is absolutely wrong,\" Booker said, accusing Republicans of trying to rush Bove's nomination through the committee.",
      "At the start of the hearing, Grassley accused his Democratic colleagues of \"unfair rhetoric and treatment\" of Bove.",
      "\"Mr. Bove has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably. He deserves fair treatment,\" Grassley said. \"The vicious partisan attacks and obstruction of nominees that we've seen from Democrats this Congress has to stop. One day, roles will reverse again, and my colleagues will want the same fairness for nominees of their president that they refuse to extend to President Trump's nominees.\"",
      "But Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said Bove shouldn't be seriously considered by the upper chamber for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.",
      "\"He led this administration's embarrassing efforts to strike a corrupt bargain with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and he's been trailed by a history of complaints long predating his affiliation with President Trump about his temperament, poor judgment and lack of candor before the court,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said.",
      "Bove's path to winning approval from the Judiciary Committee became easier earlier this week, when Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters that he was inclined to back his nomination. But it's less clear whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning the nomination would fail if Bove loses the support of four GOP senators.",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May that he had selected Bove to fill a vacancy on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bove was part of the legal team that represented the president in his criminal cases, including the New York hush-money trial and the two federal cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "After Mr. Trump won a second term, he selected Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove also worked as the acting deputy attorney general while Todd Blanche, the current deputy, awaited confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Bove has been embroiled in controversy since joining the Justice Department. He was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for commitments on immigration. Several prosecutors resigned in the wake of the move regarding Adams' case.",
      "Bove defended the decision to drop the charges against Adams, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that it was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.\" He also argued that Adams' submissions to the court \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Reuveni, a former Justice Department attorney who handled immigration cases, filed a whistleblower claim with the Senate that accused Bove of suggesting that the administration ignore court orders. Reuveni worked for more than a decade at the Justice Department and was most recently the acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation.",
      "He was fired in April after he told a federal judge that the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador had been an administrative error. A top immigration official with the administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Reuveni wrote in his report that during one meeting about Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act, Bove said that the Justice Department would need to consider telling the courts \"f**k you\" if a judicial order blocked removals under the law.",
      "Emails and text messages shared with the Senate by the whistleblower include exchanges between Reuveni and a colleague at the Justice Department in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding court orders.",
      "But Grassley said the documents were not enough to delay the vote on Bove's nomination, and he accused Democrats of mischaracterizing them.",
      "\"Government lawyers aggressively litigating and interpreting court orders isn't misconduct. It's what lawyers do all the time,\" the Iowa Republican said.",
      "But Durbin said senators could have questioned Reuveni about his claims themselves, since he volunteered to appear before the Judiciary panel.",
      "\"If you question the veracity of Mr. Reuveni, he's ready to stand before you, raise his right hand, take an oath and testify under oath. What more can you ask about credibility than that?\" he said.",
      "Booker attempted to have the committee vote on a motion to delay the vote on Bove's nomination and allow Reuveni to testify before senators, but Grassley said the proposal wasn't on the agenda.",
      "\"There's no need to rush this. What are you afraid of?\" Booker said.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Bove and sought to paint Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Blanche said the claims about Bove and other top Justice Department officials are \"utterly false.\"",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields has also praised Bove as an \"incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in June, Bove denied Reuveni's allegations that he urged department attorneys to violate a court order.",

      "The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in \"excellent\"\u00a0overall health.",

      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",

      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republican leaders expected to vote Thursday on a package to claw back $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funding, but possible amendment votes to force the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein stalled movement on President Trump's request.",
      "The House is facing a Friday end-of-day deadline to pass the bill, which is known as a rescissions request, after which the money must be spent as originally intended.",

All but one Republican on the committee voted against similar amendments when they were first presented earlier this week, further fueling criticism from those who want documents on Epstein released.",
      "The controversy has divided Mr. Trump's base since his administration released a memo earlier this month saying that Epstein had no \"client list\" and died by suicide in 2019. Some Republicans have pushed for more disclosures in the Epstein case, though Mr. Trump has called the controversy a \"hoax.\"",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not say Thursday afternoon whether he planned to delay a final vote past the deadline by exercising his right under House rules to speak for as long as he'd like, a power he used to make a record-breaking speech earlier this month.",
      "\"I expect that I will speak longer than a minute,\" the New York Democrat quipped.",
      "After an hourslong vote series, the Senate narrowly passed an amended version of Mr. Trump's rescissions request earlier Thursday, sending it to the House, which approved a larger package of cuts last month.",
      "The Senate version is about $400 million smaller after the Trump administration agreed not to cut funding for a global AIDS prevention program to alleviate some of the concerns of Republican dissenters.",
      "The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in funding cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",
      "Some senators also worried about the implications for rural areas, where many residents depend on public radio stations for emergency alerts. The administration promised to find funding elsewhere to alleviate the cuts to the rural stations to win over critics.",
      "Though all but two Republican senators ended up supporting final passage, some said they had reservations about doing so, especially because they had not received details from the administration about how the broader cuts would impact specific programs.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said Wednesday before voting for the package.",
      "Republican Sens.

    "story": [
      "A group of 20 states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of a program that provided federal funding for natural disaster mitigation projects.",
      "\"By unilaterally shutting down FEMA's flagship pre-disaster mitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of power principles,\" the lawsuit alleges, arguing that the executive branch doesn't have the authority to shut down the program funded by Congress.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, targets Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson for their role in shutting down FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, also known as BRIC, program earlier this year. The lawsuit argues the power to make such a decision falls to Congress.",
      "Before it was halted in April, the BRIC program helped fund local infrastructure projects like stormwater control systems and relocating or elevating buildings in flood-prone areas.",
      "\"Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened,\" the lawsuit states. \"And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.\"",
      "A CBS News investigation last month revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. Two-thirds of the counties losing funding voted for Mr. Trump. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "The lawsuit calls the impact of the BRIC program's shutdown \"devastating\" and says it will force communities across the country to delay, scale back or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects because of their inability to access their already-approved federal dollars.",
      "Alongside the lawsuit, the states also filed a request for a preliminary injunction asking the court to temporarily block the federal government from reallocating FEMA funds designated for disaster preparedness, arguing states will suffer irreversible damage if the funds are spent before the court rules.",
      "In an April press release announcing the cuts, which has since been removed from the FEMA website, the disaster response agency said the BRIC program was \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\"",
      "The multibillion-dollar BRIC program was established in 2018 under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"Resiliency is a priority for DHS, but over the last four years the Biden Administration used the BRIC program as a piggy bank for its green new deal agenda,\" a FEMA spokesperson told CBS News on Thursday. \"We will make sure we do right by the taxpayers by bringing integrity to all our spending. If these States take issue with that, we will see them in court.\"",
      "The states suing are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Most have Democratic state leadership and have filed other lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions. North Carolina was ravaged by mudslides and flash flooding last fall after Hurricane Helene made landfall in late September.",
      "The lawsuit comes as FEMA in recent weeks has faced scrutiny about its response to floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, including at least 37 children. It also comes just days after heavy rains and flooding inundated communities in states ranging from New York and New Jersey to New Mexico.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",

Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.

    "summary": "Three Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding for extreme heat.",
    "story": [
      "There have been 27 major disaster declarations issued by President Trump so far in 2025. The disasters range in size and scope, from the L.A. wildfires to Midwest tornadoes and the Texas flooding as well as several winter storms. Many of them have resulted in fatalities and billions of dollars in damage to property and businesses, but one major deadly weather event that occurred in June hasn't been declared: an extreme heat wave.",
      "Between June 20-24, a heat dome, or the presence of high heat over a region that lingers for an extended period of time, exposed nearly half of the country to dangerously high temperatures. On June 24, seven states tied or broke monthly high temperature records, many exceeding triple digits. One of those states, Maryland, reported that 472 people needed medical assistance for heat-related illnesses during that time when the heat index topped 110 degrees in some places. But there's no disaster declaration for the event listed on the FEMA website.",
      "That's because extreme heat is not considered a \"disaster\" that is eligible for federal funding, according to the Stafford Act, which is the guiding law that outlines when and how the president can declare disasters and direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance to state and local governments.",
      "Now, three Democratic lawmakers are attempting to change that. Senators Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, along with Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia of Texas, have proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding to flow into areas where hotter temperatures cause significant physical and economic distress. Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"Last year, more than 500 people died in one single county in Nevada from heat-related illnesses,\" Rosen said in a statement. \"Current federal policy ignores the physical and health risks that such extremely high temperatures have on our communities, which is why I'm introducing a bill to change that. By classifying extreme heat as a major disaster, our communities will be able to receive the federal funding needed to respond and prepare for future extreme heat events.\"",
      "It's not the first time Rosen has proposed the legislation. She introduced a similar bill in 2024 that passed through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee rather quickly, before being blocked by a Senate Republican.",
      "Under the Stafford Act, there are 16 types of natural disasters listed, defined as \"any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought, fire, or other catastrophe in any part of the United States which causes, or which may cause, substantial damage or injury to civilian property or persons.\" It does not explicitly list extreme heat.",
      "In a statement, Gallego said that more Americans are killed by extreme heat than any other form of extreme weather incident combined, according to the National Weather Service. \u00a0\"By adding extreme heat to FEMA's list of major disasters, we can unlock the funds and support our communities desperately need,\" he added.",
      "According to Rosen's office, declaring extreme heat a major disaster would enable states and local governments to request federal funds that could provide additional cooling centers, air conditioning to communities that need it, money for water infrastructure projects, as well as a mechanism where communities can request money for heat adaptation projects, such as planting more trees, or building shade structures to reduce urban heat.",
      "But there are some who do not agree that adding extreme heat to the Stafford Act is necessary.",
      "\"It is already eligible under the Stafford Act,\" says Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA administrator under President Biden, \"There's nothing that excludes a governor from requesting a declaration for extreme heat.\"",
      "There have been at least three previous times when a governor requested a major disaster declaration for extreme heat: in 1980 by the governor of Missouri; in 1995, when the Illinois governor requested it over a heat wave that killed more than 700 people; and most recently in 2022, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a major disaster declaration for a heat dome and resulting wildfires. In all instances, the requests were denied at the time by the sitting president.",
      "According to Criswell, the Stafford Act is designed to pay for impacts to infrastructure caused by a natural disaster, but the majority of resources a state might need for extreme heat \u2014 like cooling centers, tree shade, and air conditioning \u2014 are things that can be addressed ahead of an extreme heat event through existing hazard mitigation grants.",
      "\"What damaged infrastructure do you have from an extreme heat situation?\" Criswell told CBS News, \"You might have power issues, but is it damaged or is it just a temporary situation because of the overload on it?\"",
      "While Criswell doesn't see the need for extreme heat to be added to the Stafford Act to qualify for disaster funding, she does believe there needs to be a greater emphasis on supporting hazard mitigation projects and funding, which have been subject to cuts under the Trump administration.",
      "\"This administration has not been granting the hazard mitigation grant programing to these disaster declarations,\" says Criswell. The reasoning behind that, she says, is because much of the mitigation money that was given in previous disaster declarations hasn't been utilized.",
      "The White House has not commented on extreme heat being added as a disaster risk, and President Trump has focused on overhauling FEMA and shifting disaster response and recovery to states.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently concluded a series of public hearings as it debates whether to institute the first federal rule to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat, which would mandate employers provide paid breaks, water and shade.",
      "The rule has faced criticism from business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which says the rule would \"impose unreasonable burdens.\" Business groups have backed efforts in some Republican-led states, like Florida and Texas, to block local municipalities from passing heat protection rules for workers.",
      "Despite the pushback, seven states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota and Maryland \u2014 have adopted independent heat protection rules for workers, but significant federal legislation to address extreme heat, both in the workplace and for disaster declarations, remains an uphill battle for Democrats.",

      "CBS News and other outlets reported her firing Wednesday evening, and Comey confirmed her departure in a note to colleagues that CBS News obtained on Thursday.",

      "\"Every person lucky enough to work in this office constantly hears four words to describe our ethos: Without Fear or Favor.

    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funding early Thursday, culminating an hours-long \"vote-a-rama\" and sending it back to the House ahead of a Friday deadline.",
      "In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes\u00a0Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote.",
      "Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended.",
      "The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations.",
      "The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts.",
      "The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",
      "Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the \"small modification.\"",
      "When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters \"we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did.\"",
      "\"We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,\" Johnson added.",
      "But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski.",
      "The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented.",
      "\"To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,\" Collins said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight.",
      "\"I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\"",
      "Cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating \"without interruption.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago \u2014 the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday. The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.",
      "Britain will join a short list of countries where the voting age is 16, including Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures.",
      "The move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign finance rules to stop shell companies with unclear ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics. There will also be tougher sentences for people convicted of intimidating political candidates.",
      "Additionally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. The law ironically caught out the man who had helped to usher it onto the books, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station last year after forgetting to bring his photo ID.",
      "Britain's elections watchdog agency, the Electoral Commission, estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year's election because they lacked ID.",

      "The changes must be approved by Parliament, but Starmer's Labour Party currently holds an overwhelming majority of the seats, so it is likely to pass easily. The next national election must be held by 2029, but it could, theoretically, be called before that by the government.",
      "\"For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. \"We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.\"",
      "Stuart Fox, a politics lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied youth voting, said it's \"far from clear\" whether lowering the voting age actually increases youth engagement.",

      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "In June, the White House asked Congress to cancel $9.4 billion in appropriations that had previously been approved. The request, known as the rescissions package, passed in the House in mid-June and would cut roughly $8 billion from international assistance, including organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The Senate added an amendment to exempt $400 million in global health funding for PEPFAR, a program started during the Bush administration to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries.",
      "The revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
      "\"My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution,\" Murkowski told reporters after voting against an earlier procedural vote\u00a0Tuesday. \"So I look at the Constitution and say that it is \u2026 the legislative branch that has the power of the purse. I take that charge personally, and so I'm going to execute on it.\"",
      "In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, the package includes $1.1 billion in reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.",

      "\"I take all criticism seriously, as I think any news organization should,\" Maher said. \"And if there's a perception that we are not serving the full range of American political life, well we need to, we need to respond to that.\"",
      "Ahead of a Friday deadline, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to support the clawbacks or risk losing his support.",
      "\"It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post this month, using a nickname designed to mock MSNBC. \"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican senators have voiced concerns about cuts to public broadcasting, especially for those serving rural and Native communities. During Wednesday's vote-a-rama, Sen. Maria Cantwell warned that eliminating funding for CPB could endanger those who rely on radio for emergency information.",
      "\"We're not just putting PBS at risk here, we're putting millions of Americans who depend on local media for life-saving information [at risk],\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in a floor speech. \"And what's in this rescission request is really making sure that public broadcasters don't have that ability, at least in 20 states where they have emergency plans.\"",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a GOP holdout who initially expressed skepticism about the rescissions package, said this week he intends to support it after working with the White House to reallocate unused funding through the Department of the Interior to tribal stations.",
      "\"It will keep them in operation. It will be for one year at a time,\" Rounds said.",
      "The rescissions package comes on the heels of the devastating July 4 floods on Texas' Guadalupe River, which left more than 130 dead and search efforts are still ongoing for more than 100 still unaccounted for.",
      "Since the tragedy, there have been questions about the efficiency of emergency alert systems \u2014 many of which, Maher said, rely on public broadcasting.",
      "Maher said communities in rural areas like that would feel the largest impacts of the funding cuts. She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funds and could face tough decisions, from staffing layoffs to potential station closures.",
      "WDIY, a public radio station in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, has a mix of news and musical programming that is produced by a staff of four along with a host of community volunteers. About 15% of its overall budget comes from CPB funding.",

      "Back on June 11, six Republican lawmakers who are members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons to urge the Trump administration to prioritize the detention of violent offenders, convicted criminals and national security threats. ICE has now responded to that inquiry for the first time with figures of those deported since Jan. 1.",
      "The Republicans who signed the letter include the conference's chair, Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, along with Reps. Monica De La Cruz of Texas, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, David Valadao of California, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida and Gabe Evans of Colorado.",
      "ICE arrests have soared since Mr. Trump took office, averaging 1,200 per day in the first three weeks of June, according to internal figures previously reported by CBS News. White House adviser Stephen Miller has pushed the agency to aim for 3,000 arrests per day, a more-than-twofold increase that has led to pressure on ICE leadership.",
      "An increasingly large share of people held in ICE deteintion do not have criminal records, CBS News has previously reported. Around 40% of the agency's detainees since Mr. Trump took office had criminal convictions of some kind with 8% of them convicted of violent crimes.",
      "Mr. Trump and top administration officials have said their focus is on arresting and deporting people with serious criminal records.",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters last month.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan says the administration's primary focus is on the \"worst\" offenders, but he has long said any undocumented immigrant could be subject to arrest.",
      "\"If you're in the country illegally, you are not off the table,\" Homan said at an event in Texas this week. \"We prioritize the worst, first. That makes sense. But it doesn't mean you prioritize this group and everybody else is good to go.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***,\" criticizing members of his own party who are calling for more transparency as \"weaklings.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country's history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",
      "\"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. I mean, you see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats' work. They're stupid people.\"",
      "On Thursday, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt if the president has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to appoint a special prosecutor in the Epstein case.",
      "\"The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case,\" Leavitt said. \"That's how he feels.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements highlight the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said that senators \"ought to call her in the Judiciary Committee, put it under oath and have her testify.\"",
      "The president has tried to tamp down the controversy within his party since last week, saying on Tuesday that the Epstein case is \"pretty boring stuff.\"",
      "\"I don't understand it, why they would be so interested. He's [been] dead for a long time, he was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is,\" he told reporters. \"I really don't, and the credible information has been given.\"",

      "An ongoing purge of federal prosecutors from the Justice Department has impacted the criminal case against a Florida businessman accused of fleecing children with special needs.",
      "The latest wave of firings included the prosecutor who was helping lead the criminal case against\u00a0Leo Govoni, whose scheme allegedly bilked approximately $100 million from a fund to help people with disabilities. Michael Gordon, who also handled a series of U.S. Capitol riot prosecutions, was among several prosecutors fired in recent weeks, CBS News has learned. Gordon had recently taken over formal duties for prosecuting Govoni's case in Florida.",
      "Critics have accused the Trump administration of seeking political retribution for the U.S. Capitol insurrection cases by firing prosecutors, investigators and at least one administrator who worked on the cases. The Justice Department also fired investigators and prosecutors who helped former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified records and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "More than 20 total firings have been confirmed by CBS News. The Justice Department has not commented on the firings.",
      "Gordon's dismissal risks complicating the timeline for the Govoni case. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, is urging the Justice Department to reverse course and rehire Gordon.",
      "Castor said in a statement, \"The victims of Govoni's alleged fraud number in the thousands\u2014each with painful and personal stories. Mr. Gordon's removal places this case, and their hope for accountability, in jeopardy.\"",
      "Govoni is accused of being part of a scheme to embezzle money from an organization that was established to help manage money for people with special needs. The Justice Department said earlier this year,\u00a0 \"The defendants conspired to use the funds of special needs clients as a personal piggy bank, stealing $100 million dollars meant for the most vulnerable members of our society to enrich themselves.\"",
      "Amparo Perales, a mother whose son Javier has needed care for blindness and severe encephalitis, said her family lost $2 million in the scheme. Perales told CBS News she was \"shocked\" by Gordon's firing.",
      "\"These victims already have difficult lives and futures. A delay in the legal process is detrimental to the well being of the victims,\" Perales said.",
      "Rebekah Bowman of Florida, whose son, Kienen Freeman, suffers from a severe seizure disorder, said she lost more than $1 million in funds for her son because of Govoni's alleged scheme.",
      "\"It took long enough to get him arrested. People have been through a lot and don't want any more delays,\" Bowman said.",
      "Govoni was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and multiple counts of fraud. He has not yet entered a plea, and an arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. Govoni's lawyers asked for him to be released pre-trial, noting he has \"no prior criminal history\" and describing him as a \"67-year-old in poor physical health.\" CBS News has reached out to his attorney for comment.",
      "An accountant for Govoni's company was also charged as part of the alleged conspiracy, and a not-guilty plea was entered in his case.",
      "Prosecutors said Govoni founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in 2000 and helped manage approximately $200 million in funds and more than 2,000 special needs trusts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Govoni used the organization's accounts as a \"slush fund.\" Federal investigators said Govoni used the money to \"purchase real estate, travel via private jet, fund a brewery, make deposits into his personal bank accounts, and pay personal debts.\"",
      "In a series of letters filed with the federal court in Tampa last month, one parent of a person with special needs wrote, \"I wish you could look into the eyes of my son and the many other medically needy victims and tell them that you're going to do the right thing and keep that man behind bars where he belongs.\"",
      "Another parent wrote, \"Please do not let this horrible criminal out of jail. He is clever and surely has money hidden and plans to go into hiding if released. All his victims have breathed a sigh of relief when we heard he was finally arrested. The first relief any of us have felt since this has happened.\"",
      "Another victim wrote, \"Who steals from victimized children in foster care? The disabled? The most vulnerable amongst us? Someone who has no conscience, compassion, or mercy.\"",
      "Gordon is listed in court records as a Tampa-based prosecutor for the Justice Department. Like many federal prosecutors, he brought cases related to the Jan. 6 riots \u2014 which was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, with more than 1,500 defendants. Hours after Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he pardoned almost everybody convicted in the riot and ordered the Justice Department to drop charges against any remaining defendants.",
      "Gordon had a role in prosecuting one of the best-known Jan. 6 defendants, Ray Epps, who was at the center of conspiracy theories claiming \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 he was a government-planted agitator. Epps pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on restricted grounds and was sentenced to probation.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Gordon's firing and its possible impact on Govoni's prosecution. Gordon did not offer a comment to CBS News.",
      "Many of the prosecutors who were fired were identified by a \"weaponization working group\" set up by the Trump administration to review Biden-era law enforcement policies, CBS News previously reported. Other prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases resigned their posts with the Justice Department, ahead of the recent firings.",

      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",

      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact.

      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",

      "The Perseids meteor shower begins this week and is expected to offer one of the best shows in the sky of 2025.",
      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But as NASA explains, the meteors don't actually originate from the constellation.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:45:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",

    "story": [
      "The Perseids meteor shower begins this week and is expected to offer one of the best shows in the sky of 2025.",
      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But as NASA explains, the meteors don't actually originate from the constellation.",

    "summary": "Two black holes merged into one massive one, scientists from an international collaborative group said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland. Data from the observation window will be published later in the summer.

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins are a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill regulating the digital currency .",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death.

      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",

      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",

      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, 6 were shot and killed during their escape, and 2 drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service and the city.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official, to serve as a federal circuit judge.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.",
      "The GOP-led panel voted 12-0 to favorably report Bove's nomination to the full Senate, surmounting a key hurdle amid staunch opposition from a host of former federal prosecutors and judges, as well as allegations of unethical conduct by a Justice Department whistleblower.",
      "But as Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley called Bove's nomination for the vote, Democrats erupted in protest because not all were allowed to speak. Grassley also refused to consider a motion by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to delay consideration of Bove's nomination and allow the whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, to testify before senators.",
      "All Democratic members of the committee then left the meeting. Grassley and Republicans continued to tick through nominations, including Bove's, while Booker criticized his GOP colleagues before joining his fellow Democrats in walking out.",
      "\"This lacks decency. It lacks decorum. It shows that you do not simply want to hear from your colleagues. It is absolutely wrong,\" Booker said, accusing Republicans of trying to rush Bove's nomination through the committee.",
      "At the start of the hearing, Grassley accused his Democratic colleagues of \"unfair rhetoric and treatment\" of Bove.",
      "\"Mr. Bove has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably. He deserves fair treatment,\" Grassley said. \"The vicious partisan attacks and obstruction of nominees that we've seen from Democrats this Congress has to stop. One day, roles will reverse again, and my colleagues will want the same fairness for nominees of their president that they refuse to extend to President Trump's nominees.\"",
      "But Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said Bove shouldn't be seriously considered by the upper chamber for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.",
      "\"He led this administration's embarrassing efforts to strike a corrupt bargain with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and he's been trailed by a history of complaints long predating his affiliation with President Trump about his temperament, poor judgment and lack of candor before the court,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said.",
      "Bove's path to winning approval from the Judiciary Committee became easier earlier this week, when Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters that he was inclined to back his nomination. But it's less clear whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning the nomination would fail if Bove loses the support of four GOP senators.",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May that he had selected Bove to fill a vacancy on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bove was part of the legal team that represented the president in his criminal cases, including the New York hush-money trial and the two federal cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "After Mr. Trump won a second term, he selected Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove also worked as the acting deputy attorney general while Todd Blanche, the current deputy, awaited confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Bove has been embroiled in controversy since joining the Justice Department. He was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for commitments on immigration. Several prosecutors resigned in the wake of the move regarding Adams' case.",
      "Bove defended the decision to drop the charges against Adams, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that it was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.\" He also argued that Adams' submissions to the court \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Reuveni, a former Justice Department attorney who handled immigration cases, filed a whistleblower claim with the Senate that accused Bove of suggesting that the administration ignore court orders. Reuveni worked for more than a decade at the Justice Department and was most recently the acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation.",
      "He was fired in April after he told a federal judge that the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador had been an administrative error. A top immigration official with the administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Reuveni wrote in his report that during one meeting about Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act, Bove said that the Justice Department would need to consider telling the courts \"f**k you\" if a judicial order blocked removals under the law.",
      "Emails and text messages shared with the Senate by the whistleblower include exchanges between Reuveni and a colleague at the Justice Department in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding court orders.",
      "But Grassley said the documents were not enough to delay the vote on Bove's nomination, and he accused Democrats of mischaracterizing them.",
      "\"Government lawyers aggressively litigating and interpreting court orders isn't misconduct. It's what lawyers do all the time,\" the Iowa Republican said.",
      "But Durbin said senators could have questioned Reuveni about his claims themselves, since he volunteered to appear before the Judiciary panel.",
      "\"If you question the veracity of Mr. Reuveni, he's ready to stand before you, raise his right hand, take an oath and testify under oath. What more can you ask about credibility than that?\" he said.",
      "Booker attempted to have the committee vote on a motion to delay the vote on Bove's nomination and allow Reuveni to testify before senators, but Grassley said the proposal wasn't on the agenda.",
      "\"There's no need to rush this. What are you afraid of?\" Booker said.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Bove and sought to paint Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Blanche said the claims about Bove and other top Justice Department officials are \"utterly false.\"",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields has also praised Bove as an \"incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in June, Bove denied Reuveni's allegations that he urged department attorneys to violate a court order.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has been diagnosed with a \"benign and common\" vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed swelling in his legs, the White House said Thursday.",
      "The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in \"excellent\"\u00a0overall health.",
      "Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause.",
      "The president's doctor said he was \"thoroughly evaluated\" by the White House medical unit \"out of an abundance of caution\" after noticing swelling in recent weeks.",
      "\"The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,\" the memo said. Barbarella said there was \"no evidence\" of blood clots or arterial disease.",
      "The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said.",
      "\"All results were within normal limits,\" the memo said. \"An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified.\"",
      "The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand.",
      "\"This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,\" the memo said.",
      "What is chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should.",
      "\"Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,\" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website.",
      "Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic, with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age.",
      "Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing.",
      "The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling.",
      "Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option.",

      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen.

      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",

Police did not find any narcotics at the apartment \u2014 and afterward Taylor's death became a rallying cry for racial justice across the country.",
      "Hankison was cleared of a federal charge of using excessive force on Taylor's neighbors, and during a 2022 state trial, he was acquitted of all charges after a jury deliberated for three hours. His first federal civil rights trial in 2023 ended in a mistrial.",

      "Bryan Braman, a former Houston Texans and Eagles linebacker who won the Super Bowl with Philadelphia\u00a0in 2018, has died after a battle with a rare, aggressive form of cancer, his agent Sean Stellato confirmed Thursday. He was 38.",
      "Braman was diagnosed with cancer in February. His agent Sean Stellato told CBS Sports\u00a0earlier this month that the 38-year-old was \"in the fight of his life.\"",
      "Stellato said Thursday Braman loved being an Eagle and being a dad to his two daughters.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Bryan Braman. During his four seasons in Philadelphia, Bryan was a loyal teammate, a supporter of the community, and a valuable member of our Super Bowl LII-winning team,\" the Eagles wrote on social media. \"More importantly, he was a devoted father who passionately loved his family and everyone around him. We extend our deepest condolences to Bryan's family and all who are grieving his loss during this difficult time.\"",
      "In February, Williams Jones started an online fundraiser to help offset some of his friend's medical costs. Braman underwent CAR T-cell therapy in June in Seattle, according to the GoFundMe page.",
      "One of the largest donations came from JJ Watt, a former teammate of Braman's in Houston, who contributed $10,000.",
      "Watt posted on social media Thursday, \"Rest in Peace brother. Gone far too soon,\" along with a photo of Braman as a Texan.",
      "Braman and Watt were teammates for three seasons in Houston, starting in 2011 when they were both rookies. Braman signed with the Texans as an undrafted free agent out of West Texas A&M, while Watt was Houston's first-round pick.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Bryan Braman. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Braman family during this difficult time,\" the Texans wrote on social media.",
      "Braman entered the NFL as a long shot to make the Texans' roster, but he carved out a role on special teams on the team for three seasons from 2011 to 2013. He left Houston in 2014 to sign with the Eagles\u00a0when Chip Kelly was the team's head coach.",
      "When the Eagles signed Braman, Kelly raved about Braman's size (6-foot-5, 230) and athleticism.",
      "\"You don't find many players of Bryan's size with the ability to run down the field and make plays on special teams,\" Kelly said in 2014. \"It's an area of the game that we always have our eye on and look to improve.\"",
      "Braman left Philly for a brief stint with New Orleans in 2017, but was released by New Orleans in September. He rejoined Philadelphia in December 2017 and contributed on special teams in the Birds' Super Bowl LII run. In the Eagles' 15-10 divisional round win\u00a0over the Falcons, Braman blocked a punt by Atlanta punter Matt Bosher, leading to a Jake Elliott field goal.",
      "Braman played 24 special-teams snaps in the Eagles' 41-33 win over the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, recording one tackle.",

Then I read the news on my teammate, Bryan Braman.  Love you Braman. You lived a hard life, and you never complained about it. A champion in life and a warrior in death.  It is forever, indeed.\"",

      "While it's not known specifically what type of cancer Braman had, the 38-year-old is part of a new trend where young people are being diagnosed with cancer.",
      "According to the GoFundMe page to help pay for Braman's treatments, the former NFL special-teams standout had multiple surgeries and CAR T-cell therapy, \"which is a way of using a patient's own immune system and re-engineering those cells to fight the cancer,\" Dr. Shazia Nakhoda, with Fox Chase Cancer Center, said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it was not successful for him,\" Nakhoda said.",
      "Braman is part of a growing trend of people under the age of 50 being diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\"It's probably not a single cause, likely a lot of things contributing,\" Nakhoda said.",
      "The NIH says 14 types of cancer have increased in young people. The largest increase is with female breast cancer, followed by colorectal, kidney, uterine and pancreatic cancers.",
      "\"One thought is potentially obesity and sedentary lifestyle, perhaps environmental exposures like ultra-processed foods,\" Nakhoda said. \"Things like that may be contributing. There is a thought in the last few decades, there's a new ENV exposure that we haven't identified that could be increasing cancer risk.\"",
      "Nakhoda said to lower your cancer risk, it's important to know your family history and discuss unusual symptoms with a doctor while also getting the recommended screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies.",
      "\"Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is so important,\" Nakhoda said. \"Avoiding excess alcohol, not smoking are good ways to keep your health in check.\"",
      "She says the HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines can also lower the risk of developing certain cancers.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 16:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GENIUS Act is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",
      "\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor debate.",
      "The broader market structure bill also passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the Senate. The legislation banning a central bank digital currency was approved largely along party lines.",

Puerto Rican Gov. Jennifer Gonzalez approved the law late Wednesday, following a wave of similar legislation passed across the U.S.",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday. The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.",
      "Britain will join a short list of countries where the voting age is 16, including Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures.",
      "The move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign finance rules to stop shell companies with unclear ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics. There will also be tougher sentences for people convicted of intimidating political candidates.",
      "Additionally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. The law ironically caught out the man who had helped to usher it onto the books, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station last year after forgetting to bring his photo ID.",
      "Britain's elections watchdog agency, the Electoral Commission, estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year's election because they lacked ID.",
      "Turnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.",
      "Harry Quilter-Pinner, head of left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the changes were \"the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,\" when the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21.",
      "The changes must be approved by Parliament, but Starmer's Labour Party currently holds an overwhelming majority of the seats, so it is likely to pass easily. The next national election must be held by 2029, but it could, theoretically, be called before that by the government.",
      "\"For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. \"We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.\"",
      "Stuart Fox, a politics lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied youth voting, said it's \"far from clear\" whether lowering the voting age actually increases youth engagement.",
      "\"It is right to help young people be heard,\" he said. \"But there are other measures which are more effective at getting young people to vote - particularly those from the poorest backgrounds who are by far the least likely to vote \u2014 such as beefing up the citizenship curriculum or expanding the provision of volunteering programs in schools.\"",

    "summary": "The site where the remains were found was once home to a beloved ice cream shop.",
    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

    "summary": "A prosecutor has asked Brazil's Supreme Court to find ex-president Jair Bolsonaro guilty of plotting a violent coup after a trial that saw President Trump try to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "Brasilia\u00a0\u2014 A prosecutor asked Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday to find ex-president Jair Bolsonaro guilty of plotting a coup, in closing arguments after a trial that saw President Trump try to intervene on behalf of his right-wing ally. Bolsonaro is accused of seeking to overturn the 2022 election won by his left-wing opponent, current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.",
      "The prosecution told the court that Bolsonaro, a former army officer, and seven others were guilty of participating in \"armed criminal association\" and had sought to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\"",
      "After the defense presents its closing arguments, a five-justice panel will decide the fate of the former president. If found guilty, Bolsonaro and his co-defendants could face up to 40 years in prison.",
      "Bolsonaro says he is the victim of political persecution, echoing Mr. Trump's defense when he faced criminal charges before his White House return.",
      "\"It's not about imprisoning me; they want to eliminate me,\" Bolsonaro told news website Poder360 on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors say Bolsonaro tried to overturn his 2022 loss in a plot that only failed because the military did not side with him. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "After the plot failed, violent Bolsonaro supporters rioted, rampaging through government buildings in the capital Brasilia in scenes that echoed the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Mr. Trump's supporters after the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "The trial has attracted attention from Mr. Trump, who returned to power in the 2024 election and continues to claim \u2014   despite this being rejected repeatedly by the courts \u2014   that he won in 2020. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on social media for Bolsonaro's trial to be stopped, accusing the authorities in Brazil of mounting a \"witch hunt\" and a \"disgrace.\"",
      "On July 9, he took his campaign to extraordinary new levels by announcing plans to tariff Brazilian imports to the U.S. at 50%, again citing what he called a \"witch hunt\" against Bolsonaro. And on Tuesday, Washington said it was opening an investigation into \"unfair trading practices\" by Brazil, a move that could provide a legal basis to justify imposing tariffs on South America's largest economy.",
      "Unlike the tariffs that Mr. Trump is slapping on countries around much of the world, including top U.S. allies, the measures against Brazil \u2014   which are set to take effect on August 1 \u2014   were announced in openly political terms.",
      "Mr. Trump cited \"Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections,\" among other issues, warning of further escalation if the country retaliated \u2014 something Lula indicated would happen.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated his claim that Bolsonaro was being unfairly treated.",
      "\"They're treating President Bolsonaro very unfairly,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, calling him \"a good man.\"",
      "\"I know the honest ones, and I know the crooked ones,\" he added.",
      "Lula has hit back at Mr. Trump's \"interference,\" insisting that \"no one is above the law.\"",

Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",

      "Scandals involving monks surface a few times a year in Thailand but usually don't involve senior members of the clergy.

    "summary": "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was discovered more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands.",
    "story": [
      "A famed Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal battle in World War II has been discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean more than 80 years after it sank, an exploration team has revealed. The warship was found still armed with unused depth charges, according to the explorers.",
      "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was located by a remotely operated vehicle more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands, the Ocean Exploration Trust announced on Saturday.",
      "\"Lying on the seabed at over 800 meters in the Solomon Islands, this is the first time anyone has laid eyes on Teruzuki since it was sunk in WWII's naval battles off Guadalcanal,\" said the trust, which released images and video of the wreck.",
      "Teruzuki (which translates to \"Shiny Moon\" in Japanese) was under the command of Rear Admiral Raizou Tanaka. The legendary naval leader earned the moniker \"Tenacious Tanaka\" among U.S. forces for leading dangerous attacks and so-called \"Tokyo Express\" supply missions during the middle of the night.",
      "Weeks before descending to its watery grave, the Teruzuki used its state-of-the-art weaponry to great effect. In November 1942, the 400-foot-long Akizuki-class destroyer used its rapid-fire 100mm guns to help sink two U.S. destroyers,\u00a0according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The Teruzuki's torpedoes also severely damaged two other U.S. battleships.",
      "But on Dec. 12, 1942, the Teruzuki was targeted by American PT boats as it tried to protect a convoy of supply ships on Guadalcanal's northern coast, according to historians. The Teruzuki was hit by two U.S. torpedoes, breaking its rudder and disabling the ship. Most of the crew were rescued or swam ashore, but nine men died as the Teruzuki plunged to the bottom of the ocean.",
      "A remotely operated camera launched by the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus brought the first glimpse of the ship since that day when it spotted the wreck on July 10, the trust said. The massive warship had been severed, with its stern and hull 650 feet apart on the seafloor \u2014 but its munitions were still intact.",
      "An eerie video released by the trust shows the stern armed with multiple depth charges. One scientist can be heard on the video saying that an expert warned the team to be \"extra careful as some Japanese ordnance at this time of the war had a reputation for being really sensitive.\"",
      "The team also noted that the ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward.",
      "\"When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate,\" the trust said in a separate news release.",
      "Ship located in Iron Bottom Sound",
      "Iron Bottom Sound in the Solomon Islands was the site of five pivotal naval battles between August and December 1942.",
      "Located about 600 northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands became coveted territory for both Japan and the Allied Forces during World War II. The tiny island of Guadalcanal was key because of its airfield and its location, which offered command over shipping lanes in the region.",
      "\"Recognizing this island and airfield's strategic value, both sides would soon commit substantial naval and air resources to control the island, the airfield, and its surrounding waters,\" the Ocean Exploration Trust  said.",
      "Dozens of warships were sunk in Iron Bottom Sound, and the Teruzuki is just the latest to be discovered. Earlier this month, the same researchers found the severed bow of the American warship USS New Orleans during seafloor mapping operations in the area.",
      "In addition to the Teruzuki, at least six Japanese warships were lost off Guadalcanal between August and December 1942, according to the trust, and at least 10 Allies ships were lost during the same period.",
      "One of the American vessels lost in the area was the USS Laffey, a Benson-class destroyer that survived a major battle in October 1942 but was sunk in Guadalcanal on Nov. 12, 1942. One of the ships that sank USS Laffey was in fact the Teruzuki, which had only seen combat for a few months until its demise.",
      "The designs and details of Japanese naval ships were cloaked in secrecy during World War II. There are no historical images of the\u00a0  Teruzuki, making the new discovery especially revealing, the trust said.",

      "ENCINO, Calif. \u2013 A suspect, identified as 22-year-old Raymond Boodarian, has been arrested for double homicide after Robin Kaye, a longtime \"American Idol\" music supervisor, and her husband were found murdered inside their Los Angeles mansion on Monday, according to a press release from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).",
      "Kaye and husband Thomas Deluca were found dead inside their home after officers responded to a call around 2:30 p.m. on July 14 for a welfare check in the 4700 block of White Oak Avenue in Encino. Both victims were 70.",
      "It is believed the murders may have occurred on July 10 after the investigation revealed the LAPD had received two calls that day reporting a possible burglary suspect at the house around 4 p.m., according to police.",

      "\"They did request a flyover by our airship, which did happen. There were no signs of forced entry during this flyover. And again, that the suspect entered the property without force and entry. So there were no signs of burglary. And regarding what evidence there was in the front porch, it was not visible by air due to the foyer having a kind of a cover over it there at the front of the house. So the airship was not able to see what the officers observed during the welfare check.\"",
      "On Monday, LAPD officers responded after a friend of the victims called for a welfare check, Golan said during a press conference on Tuesday. The friend became worried after she had not heard from the victims for several days. The officers met the friend at the home and were able to gain access with a key code that she had to the vehicle gate in front of the house.",

    "summary": "Mental health experts discuss the hidden toll of the Texas floods that victims will face long after emergency crews leave. Dr. Sabrina Browne shares warning signs with parents.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS LOOK FOR GOD IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY",
      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "Texas professionals like Browne aren\u2019t alone in their work to help flood victims recover, Spring Health, a company focused on providing mental health solutions, recently committed $500,000 in free services for flood victims in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico.",
      "\"Recovering from a disaster isn\u2019t just about rebuilding what was lost. It is also about caring for the emotional toll that follows. We want people to know they are not alone,\" Spring Health CEO April Koh told Fox News Digital. \"This program is here to ensure that those impacted have a way to access high-quality, confidential mental health support at no cost.\"",

      "When it comes to knowing if your child needs professional help, Browne told Fox News Digital that it comes down to noticing changes in day-to-day behavior. She said that there are reactions parents can expect to see, such as their child regressing and maybe wanting to sleep in their room to feel safe.",
      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, the Health and Human Services Department took the view that taxpayer dollars \u2013 even though prohibited by Congress from being used to pay for abortions directly under the Hyde Amendment \u2013 could be used to provide transportation services for patients seeking an abortion. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), charged with interpreting the laws for the president and executive branch agencies, agreed at the time under the Biden administration.",

      "\"Where such transportation services are necessary for an individual to obtain an abortion, the associated costs constitute the kind of indirect expense that the post-1993 Hyde Amendment limits,\" the opinion continues. \"Under current circumstances, interstate transportation expenses could dwarf the cost of the abortion procedure itself. It would thus be inconsistent with longstanding congressional policy \u2013 as reflected in the Hyde Amendment\u2019s textual bar on \u2018expend[itures] for any abortion\u2019 \u2013 for HHS to fund such expenses merely because they do not go directly to the person or entity performing the abortion.\"",

      "Los Angeles GOP Chair Roxanne Hoge explains how Los Angeles is politically responding to recent ICE activity, including Republican and Independent voters.",
      "The federal immigration operations in Los Angeles have created a sense of \"political irony\" in the Golden State, according to Los Angeles County Republican Party Chair Roxanne Hoge.",
      "The region continues to make waves after anti-ICE riots in June, as well as authorities recently conducting a massive operation on a cannabis farm in Southern California that resulted in a riot, hundreds of illegal immigrant arrests and a child labor investigation into the company. The operation was the result of a criminal search warrant, and the company, Glass House Brands, has denied intentional wrongdoing.",
      "\"The political irony of the Trump administration coming in to clean up the mess that the California Democrats has made, is it will make Los Angeles livable, right?\" Hoge said.",

      "A law enforcement officer fires a less-lethal projectile during a protest on Saturday, June 14, 2025 in Los Angeles. (Noah Berger)",
      "\"They're gonna end up looking better because the traffic will be easier, ERs will be easy to get to, and people will realize that there isn't a two-tiered justice system,\" Hoge continued. \"If you want to open a restaurant in Los Angeles, you're looking at years before you can get the permits and build something. Just look at the poor people in the Palisades. If you're illegal, Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom have rolled out the welcome mat for you and your cart on the street. And people are noticing that.\"",
      "In a deep blue area, Republicans generally have an uphill battle, and Hoge said that the message for the party to Independents and \"disaffected Democrats\" is to \"continue to espouse public safety.\" In November, Los Angeles County voters ousted progressive District Attorney George Gascon and swapped him out with Nathan Hochman, an independent, by a wide margin.",
      "\"That really is the number one role of government, and it is the thing that the Democrats have completely failed at,\" Hoge said. \"They own Los Angeles, all of it. The encampments, the inability to run a business, the inability of your kids to get a good education. That all lies on the feet of California Democrats, and we're just going to keep pointing out that we can do better.\"",
      "The fires in Los Angeles brought heightened scrutiny to California leadership earlier this year, but the attention on them quickly shifted to immigration nationally. Mayor Bass and Gov. Newsom have been vocal opponents of the administration, with the mayor even directly meeting with ICE during a sweep earlier this month near MacArthur Park.",

      "\"I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a deal to be made. Like I told you, the deal that needs to be made is for them to go home,\" the Democrat said at the press conference.",

      "Newsom has also remained firm in his stance against the administration, including a lawsuit against National Guard troop deployment by President Donald Trump over the riots in June.",
      "\"For more than a month, [Trump] has been exploiting [the California National Guard] as his political pawns,\" Newsom posted to X on July 15, as some of the troops were taken off their orders. \"Thousands of members are still federalized in Los Angeles for no reason and unable to carry out their critical duties across the state. End this theater and send everyone home.\"",

      "\"My message is the same to everyone, including disaffected Democrats, of which I was a classic liberal. I'm an immigrant. I came here legally and became a naturalized citizen,\" Hoge said, adding that Democrats are \"taking advantage\" of people coming to the country illegally and opening the door to \"exploitation by employers,\" sex crimes, and \"all sorts of horrible things.\"",
      "\"I would say just remember that the fruit of the poison tree is the original sanctuary laws,\" Hoge said.",

      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",

Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",

      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",

      "The development of the Vanguard underwater habitat starts with dry assembly. All parts, including the wet porch and pressure vessel, are built, tested and put together on land. Then, the team conducts dry testing by pressurizing the vessel with air to check for leaks and confirm it can maintain the necessary ambient pressure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "After that, dockside testing begins. The habitat is placed in water beside a dock for gradual submersion, which makes it easy to test for water-tightness and electrical safety.",
      "Finally, the team conducts full underwater testing. In this phase, Vanguard operates on the seafloor and receives air, power, water, and communications from the surface. This final step offers key feedback on how people live and work in the habitat, helping DEEP improve Vanguard and design the larger Sentinel system.",

French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out.

      "Bank of America and other big institutions are seeing major customer engagement with their AI-powered chatbots.",
      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",

      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web.

      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "How Gmail\u2019s \u2018Manage Subscriptions\u2019 tool works",
      "Recently, Google expanded its Android unsubscribe feature to Gmail's desktop version, introducing a new \"Manage Subscriptions\" button. This feature compiles every email list you're subscribed to, showing the sender's name, email address, and how many messages you've received recently, all in one convenient place. With just a click, you can unsubscribe from any or all of these lists without leaving the page. The tool offers several key benefits. You can quickly unsubscribe from dozens of mailing lists in just a few seconds.",
      "All of your active subscriptions are displayed on a single page, so there's no need to hunt through your inbox or open individual emails. It's also safer, as it avoids the risks of clicking on unknown or potentially malicious unsubscribe links found in some messages.",
      "Gmail's Manage Subscriptions tool also provides a secure and convenient way to reduce inbox clutter without depending on third-party services. Unlike those apps, Gmail's feature doesn't ask for access to your inbox, helping protect your personal data. It's built directly into Gmail, works with your current setup, and doesn't require any extra downloads or paid plans. In some cases, you may still need to visit a sender's website to complete the unsubscribe process, and Gmail will give you options like \"Go to website\" or \"Block\" on mobile.",
      "The new \"Manage subscriptions\" tool is being gradually released across the web, iOS and Android, so if it's not visible yet, it should appear soon.",

      "Make a habit of visiting Gmail's Manage Subscriptions page every few weeks. This tool shows you all the mailing lists you're currently subscribed to and how frequently each sender contacts you. Unsubscribing from irrelevant or annoying lists only takes a click and helps prevent your inbox from being overrun with marketing emails.",
      "Set up Gmail filters to automatically archive, label, or delete certain types of messages. For example, you can filter out promotional offers that arrive too often. This keeps your inbox focused without manually sorting through messages every day.",
      "Think twice before clicking on \"unsubscribe\" links in unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Some of these links are used in phishing attacks to confirm your email address or trick you into handing over personal information. If you're unsure, it's safer to use Gmail's built-in tools instead.",
      "For Android devices, Google Play Protect offers built-in malware protection and can automatically remove known threats. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. That's why it's important to add a trusted antivirus app.",
      "The same goes for iPhones, Macs, and PCs. While Apple and Microsoft have built-in defenses, adding reputable antivirus software gives you extra layers of protection against phishing, ransomware, and other digital threats.",

      "See my picks for the best antivirus protection of 2025 for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Consider creating an alias email address for online shopping, newsletters, and one-time sign-ups. This keeps promotional messages out of your main inbox and makes it easier to manage subscriptions. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "When you receive an unwanted email, don't just delete it, mark it as spam. Gmail uses this feedback to improve its filtering system and automatically catch similar messages in the future. This helps protect not only your inbox, but other users' too.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gmail's new Manage Subscriptions tool is a long-awaited upgrade for anyone tired of inbox overload. With the ability to see all your subscriptions in one place and unsubscribe in bulk, you can reclaim your inbox, and your attention, in just a few minutes. If you haven't spotted the feature yet, keep an eye out as Google continues to roll it out to more users. In the meantime, enjoy a cleaner, more focused email experience, one click at a time.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/why-you-should-think-twice-before-joining-power-saver-program",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "Turn on alerts from your utility so you receive notifications about peak demand events by email, text or app. Check your utility\u2019s website for schedules or forecasts and opt out in advance if needed. Staying informed gives you more control over how your system behaves.",

Customers may experience reduced comfort, equipment wear, and loss of control, sometimes without realizing they\u2019ve opted in. There are also valid concerns around data privacy and security.

      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back.

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower.

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",

      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them.

      "AI AND LEARNING RETENTION: DOES CHATGPT HELP OR HURT?",
      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",
      "A man on the phone with customer service\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person. The best approach is not to replace humans but to use both people and technology in the right ways. Let the chatbot handle the quick stuff. Bring in the human when the conversation really matters.",

There simply aren't enough people willing to do the backbreaking work of weeding fields, and the weeds themselves are getting harder to kill with chemicals. Many farmers would rather avoid using herbicides, but until now, they haven't had a practical alternative.

      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Tesla delivers on solar Supercharger vision with off-grid charging station",
      "Tesla has long promised to integrate solar panels and battery storage into its Supercharger stations. CEO Elon Musk envisioned a network where most stations could operate off-grid, powered by renewable energy. While a few stations received solar upgrades over the years, most remained reliant on conventional electricity sources. Now, with the Oasis project, Tesla is finally delivering on that promise in a big way.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Inside the Oasis Supercharger: Tesla\u2019s largest solar EV charging hub",
      "The Oasis Supercharger is truly massive. It will eventually offer 168 charging stalls, with half of them already operational. The station is powered by an impressive 11 megawatts of solar panels, which include both ground-mounted arrays and solar canopies. These panels cover 30 acres of land, making it one of the largest solar-powered EV charging stations in the world. To store the energy generated by the solar farm, Tesla has installed 10 Megapacks, which together provide 39 megawatt-hours of battery capacity.",
      "What makes Oasis especially remarkable is its ability to operate completely off the grid. This means it can provide reliable charging even during power outages or in remote locations where grid access is limited. Tesla brought 84 stalls online just in time for the busy Fourth of July travel weekend, and the remaining stalls, along with a new driver lounge, are expected to open later this year.",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Why Tesla\u2019s solar-powered Oasis Supercharger is a game-changer",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger sets a new standard for the industry. It shows that EV charging stations can be fully powered by renewable energy and operate independently from the grid. This approach could transform how we think about fueling electric vehicles and help accelerate the transition to clean transportation.",
      "Regulatory challenges could slow future off-grid EV charging projects",
      "Despite this impressive achievement, challenges remain. Recent changes in U.S. legislation have reduced incentives for solar energy and battery storage projects. These policy shifts could slow down the development of similar off-grid charging stations across the country. As a result, the expansion of renewable energy and EV infrastructure might face headwinds in the near future.",

      "Pulling into a station, swapping your electric car battery and getting back on the road in under two minutes is now a reality.",
      "In China, CATL's swappable EV batteries are making this possible. This innovation is transforming the way drivers think about electric vehicle charging by making it fast, easy and as convenient as refueling with gasoline.",

      "ENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",
      "CATL's Choco-SEB battery system is focused on speed and flexibility. It is designed to support a wide range of electric vehicles, from compact city cars to larger sedans. The system lets drivers swap batteries quickly and choose the setup that matches their needs best. With this technology, a single battery swap can deliver up to 373 miles of range, depending on the vehicle.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The Choco-SEB batteries are available in two sizes, making them adaptable for different car models. Drivers can install one, two or even three battery blocks, depending on how much driving range they want. For compact cars, the system can provide up to 311 miles of range, while midsize vehicles can achieve as much as 373 miles per swap. This flexibility makes the Choco-SEB system a practical solution for a wide variety of drivers and travel needs.",
      "Illustration of where swappable EV batteries are placed in a vehicle\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "CATL swappable EV batteries offer high-efficiency and safe chemistry",
      "The battery uses a blend of lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt. This mix offers a balance of performance and safety, with an energy density of more than 160 Wh/kg and 325 Wh/L. The first car to launch with a Choco-SEB swappable EV battery is the Changan Oshan 520. It starts at around 166,800 yuan, or roughly $23,100. The vehicle offers a 320-mile range and is already gaining traction. Changan has delivered over 1,000 units and has received more than 15,000 orders.",

      "Battery swapping stations are expanding across China",
      "CATL is actively building a network of battery swap stations across China. As of now, 34 stations are operating in Chongqing. More than 50 are expected by the end of the year.",
      "By the end of 2025, CATL plans to have 1,000 stations across 31 cities. Each station is compact, requiring the space of just three parking spots, and they can hold up to 48 swappable EV batteries.",
      "CATL is working with major automakers, including GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW and BAIC. The company holds almost 29% of the global EV battery market. With the addition of swappable EV batteries, it is strengthening its position as a leader in the industry.",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

Scenes of hurried passengers chugging water or tossing full bottles into trash bins have become routine \u2014 and agents are required to confiscate anything that doesn\u2019t comply, often to the frustration of everyday travelers.",
      "The move comes a week after Noem ended the shoe-off requirement, citing newer technology that can scan for potentially dangerous items. She said the TSA wants to keep people safe, but also provide some hospitality as well.",

      "Though the U.S., which, alongside the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, signed the 2015 deal, was deemed by the U.N. and other JCPOA members unable to utilize the mechanism after Washington withdrew from the agreement in 2018 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Despite repeated calls by the U.S. to enforce snapback \u2013 which would legally enforce all 15 U.N. members on the council, including Russia, to reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2013 no one on the UNSC or JCPOA has yet taken steps to enforce the sanctions.",
      "\"I would say one of the few good things about the JCPOA is that it reverse engineers the veto in the sense that you really only need one of the permanent members to be able to do this,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Iran orogram told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"But why is no one doing it? It's because it's a risky move.",
      "\"I think it's a worthwhile move, but we have to be honest \u2013 it's a risky move,\" he added.",
      "Ben Taleblu explained that Iran\u2019s most likely response to the severe sanctions under the snapback mechanism would be its abandonment of the\u00a0Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u00a0(NPT) \u2013 an international agreement that over 190 nations have signed, pledging either not to transfer weapons to another recipient by nuclear-capable nations, or not to develop atomic arms by non-nuclear nations, among other commitments.",

      "The terms of the agreement are monitored by the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency \u2013 which Iran has already suspended cooperation with following U.S. and Israeli strikes against its nuclear program last month.",
      "\"In a world in which Iran's most likely response is to leave the NPT, one has to be confident in at least the ability of military threats to deter Iran further, or at least the credibility of America's and Israel\u2019s, or the international community's, military options against Iran moving forward,\" Ben Taleblu said.",
      "\"The problem is the lack of a game plan. Has America provided Europe with a game plan, a road map for post-snapback?\" he added, noting there needs to be a much larger strategy for next steps should sanctions be reinforced.",
      "Though the U.S. assesses that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been stunted by up to two years, experts remain convinced that Tehran\u2019s atomic ambitions have not been deterred, and its ties to terrorist networks and adversarial nations mean it remains a top security concern.",
      "Trump has said he is still committed to negotiating with Iran on its nuclear program, though questions remain over how long he will continue to allow negotiations to drag out before a European nation like the U.K., France or Germany must step in to enact snapback sanctions not only before the October deadline, but before Russia takes over control of the UNSC presidency that month.",
      "Pushing through the snapback mechanism is expected to be a roughly six-week process.",

      "Negotiations to secure a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seem to have hit an impasse amid hopes from top mediators, including President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, that a deal can be reached soon.",
      "There are several issues that remain major hurdles in securing lasting peace in the Gaza Strip and the return of all the hostages, according to multiple sources that Fox News Digital has spoken with.",
      "But one of the top sticking points has reportedly been the question of aid to the Palestinians and who exactly should be distributing the direly needed support.",

      "TRUMP SAYS 'VERY CLOSE' TO SECURING ISRAEL, HAMAS CEASEFIRE, RETURNING HOSTAGES",
      "\"This is a complex political environment right in the middle of a ceasefire negotiation,\" Chairman for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) Rev. Johnnie Moore told Fox News Digital. \"I understand on the first night of the ceasefire negotiation, one of the primary issues that Hamas and their negotiators brought up was they wanted to see the elimination of the GHF.",
      "\"Which ought to tell you something,\" he continued. \"Hamas didn't want 70 million meals of food in the Gaza Strip for the people they allege they care about \u2013 this is absurd.\"",
      "Following Israel\u2019s near-three-month blockade on aid to the Gaza Strip, the GHF \u2013 a U.S. and Israeli-backed aid mechanism \u2013 was, in late May, permitted to initiate food delivery with the assistance of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) as a means to ensure food trucks were not overrun and ransacked by the Hamas terrorist group.",
      "The GHF, which has faced stiff backlash for its divergence from traditional humanitarian assistance methods, has argued that its convoys have been far better secured from Hamas attacks than United Nations\u2019 delivery trucks, and therefore ensured the aid has actually ended up in the hands of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Hamas has long used humanitarian assistance as a means of control over Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and as a tool for recruitment, going so far as to threaten starving civilians from accepting\u00a0GHF food aid for their families in late May, telling them they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"",
      "The GHF has delivered some 70 million meals to between 800,000 and 1 million Palestinians, Moore confirmed.",
      "But reports have repeatedly surfaced claiming that Palestinians flocking to the four distribution sites have faced insurmountable dangers and on Friday the U.N. Human Rights Office said it believed nearly 800 people had been killed near aid sites.",

      "The U.N. did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether it was the IDF or Hamas that was on the firing end of the gun, and whether these deaths occurred as a direct result of civilians seeking aid, chaotic eruptions that ensued outside of distribution centers, or if these were deaths occurred amid the continued war as civilians were in the process of heading to distributions centers.",
      "The IDF earlier this month said that following an investigation into civilian casualties reported at aid distribution sites, it had issued new orders to its South Command based on \"lessons learned.\"",
      "The GHF this week announced a second phase in its aid delivery system that could lower the threats civilians face when seeking aid, by distributing supplies directly through community leaders across Gaza \u2013 meaning there could be less travel involved for civilians in need.",
      "But the GHF also fervently rejects the U.N. death toll figures and Moore maintains that no deaths have occurred on or near their distribution sites.",
      "\"The U.N. is lying. They're just lying. They're taking statistics that originate from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, and they're sharing those statistics without any scrutiny at all,\" Moore told Fox News Digital.",

We know that Hamas doesn't distinguish between the death of Hamas militants and between civilians, and\u2026we know that from the very beginning of the operation of GHF, Hamas made an intentional decision that the best way to see the end of GHF was to say that our sites were these death traps,\" he added.",
      "The U.N., on the other hand, maintains that it vets its own informants and obtains evidence through \"various reliable sources, including medical, human rights and humanitarian organizations.\"",
      "But critics of the U.N. continue to question its trustworthiness following the apparent discovery of at least nine employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), who were reportedly involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, which saw the death of some 1,200 Israelis and the abductions of another 250 \u2013 50 of whom remain hostage.",
      "Though Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, terminated those employees in October 2024, there remains open hostility between the U.N. agency and Israel, and now the GHF.",
      "Lazzarini, along with more than 200 other humanitarian organizations, has also personally called for the removal of the GHF from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Moore accused the U.N. of employing \"mafia\"-like tactics by ganging up on the aid program despite the success it has seen by supplying millions of meals.",

      "\"We want to work with these organizations, but instead of engaging with us, what they've been doing is they've been working behind the scenes to sabotage us,\" Moore said. \"There's no other way to describe it. The U.N. is behaving like a mafia.\"",
      "While the U.N. has not officially called for the removal of the GHF, it has criticized the organization\u2019s \"militarized\" approach to delivering aid, which is not viewed as acceptable by the Sphere Association, which sets the international standards for humanitarian aid.",
      "Both the GHF and the U.N. have said more aid is not only needed, but it would help eliminate the intense security risks affiliated with obtaining humanitarian supplies.",
      "\"I have been very clear that the U.N. cannot do humanitarian work alone in Gaza, we need partners,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Digital. \"All that we ask is that these partners operate under the globally accepted humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\"",
      "Though both sides ultimately have the same goal, there appears to be an increasing impasse over how to provide stable aid for Palestinians who continue to live in extremely dire situations.",
      "\"My mission, and the mission of GHF is really, really simple. It's just to feed people. And it should not be as controversial as it has been,\" Moore said. \"My interest has always been in the in the \u2018day after\u2019. We have to do both.\"",

      "Publish the client list \u2014 if it exists",

But she clarified this month at a Cabinet meeting that she was speaking more broadly about documents related to Epstein, not a specific list of clients.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the Republican Party\u2019s top inquisitors in Congress, is expected to be deposed Friday about allegations that he failed to protect the wrestlers he once coached at Ohio State University from a sexual predator, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News.",
      "Jordan, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, has repeatedly and publicly denied any knowledge that the team\u2019s doctor, Richard Strauss, was preying on the athletes.",
      "It will be the first time Jordan has be questioned under oath by lawyers representing hundreds of former OSU students, both athletes and nonathletes, who are suing the school for damages in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio. Jordan is not a defendant, but he is referred to in some of the lawsuits alleging he was aware of the abuse.",
      "Jordan, the powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, is known for his combative questioning of witnesses and for avoiding suit jackets during it.",
      "Reached for comment, Jordan spokesperson Russell Dye released a variation of the statement Jordan\u2019s team has been using since July 2018, when three former OSU wrestlers told NBC News that Jordan was lying when he claimed he did not know that Strauss molested them under the guise of giving physical examinations.",
      "\u201cAs everyone knows, Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Mike DiSabato, who wrestled for Jordan and was the first former OSU student who publicly accused him of having turned a blind eye to the abuse Strauss inflicted on him and his teammates, said he does not expect Jordan to say any more than he already has.",
      "\u201cI assume he\u2019s going to triple down and follow the same script he followed back in 2018 when he went on Fox and denied knowing about any abuse, denied being told of any abuse, never heard the word \u2018abuse,\u2019\u201d DiSabato said.",
      "DiSabato was referring to an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in which Jordan also insisted that he did not hear any locker room banter about Strauss.",
      "Still, said DiSabato, who previously reached a settlement with OSU, he hopes Jordan \u201cwill finally come out and admit that he knew Strauss was doing unnecessary prostate exams, doing unnecessary genital exams, taking multiple showers with athletes, all while being employed by a university funded by the state of Ohio.\u201d",
      "Jordan will sit down for a deposition about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called \u201cSurviving Ohio State,\u201d in which one of the wrestlers he once coached flat-out called him a liar.",
      "Another Strauss survivor, Steve Snyder-Hill, said he will watch the deposition Friday at his lawyer\u2019s office in Columbus. While he is not a former athlete, Snyder-Hill is one of the former OSU students suing the university.",
      "\u201cI expect him to lie under oath,\u201d Snyder-Hill said. \u201cI don\u2019t know a nicer way to put it.\u201d",
      "Snyder-Hill said Strauss abused him at a campus clinic in 1995. He said that what the doctor was alleged to have been doing to young men under the guise of giving physical examinations eventually became an open secret throughout campus, extending beyond the athletes\u2019 locker rooms.",
      "\u201cJordan had a locker two down from Strauss, and Jordan claims he didn\u2019t know?\u201d Snyder-Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d",
      "Strauss, who died in 2005, worked at OSU from 1978 through 1998.",
      "Prompted by allegations from DiSabato and other former OSU wrestlers, the university agreed to an independent investigation by the Perkins Coie law firm, which concluded in 2019 that coaches and athletic administrators knew for two decades that Strauss was molesting male athletes and other students but failed to sound the alarm or stop him.",
      "Jordan\u2019s former communications director, Ian Fury, insisted in 2019 that the report absolved Jordan. All of the coaches and administrators\u2019 names were redacted in the version of the report released to the public.",
      "Fury cited as proof a line in the report that said investigators \u201cdid not identify any other contemporaneous documentary evidence indicating that members of the OSU coaching staff, including head coaches or assistant coaches, received or were aware of complaints regarding Strauss\u2019 sexual misconduct.\u201d",
      "Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized \u201cto each person who endured\u201d abuse at the hands of Strauss.",
      "Several of the lawsuits mention Jordan by name.",
      "Still facing at least five active lawsuits from 236 men alleging Strauss molested them, too, OSU, which had apologized to Strauss\u2019 victims and had reported in 2019 that Strauss committed 1,429 sexual assaults and 47 rapes, walked back its previous position in October 2023 and denied having admitted any wrongdoing. The settlements it paid out were without admission of liability and were reached through mediation.",
      "OSU also argued that the statute of limitations in the case against it had run out.",
      "But in June 2023, the Supreme Court refused to reconsider a lower court ruling that said former students should be allowed to sue OSU, paving the way for their lawyers to question Jordan and other OSU employees about Strauss.",
      "Former Athletic Director Andy Geiger was deposed Wednesday, NBC affiliate WCMH of Columbus reported. Some of the lawsuits refer to Geiger as one of several people whom student-athletes allege they told about the abuse when it was happening.",
      "\u201cWe plan to depose every OSU employee alleged to have known about Strauss\u2019 abuse, including the employees named in the complaints,\u201d Adele Kimmel, director of the Public Justice Students\u2019 Civil Rights Project, said in June 2023."

      "The pair had a complicated personal and professional history \u2014 both as former romantic partners and as bandmates. Their arrival in Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s helped usher the band\u2019s most commercially successful era, but Buckingham was dismissed from the band in 2018, and the pair have not performed together since.",
      "The apparently coordinated nature of the posts, which came just one day after Mick Fleetwood shared an Instagram video of himself listening to \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d raised questions about whether the former bandmates might be planning something together. In the video, Fleetwood removes his headphones and calls the song \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",

      "Buckingham and Nicks both liked Fleetwood\u2019s post and recently began following each other on Instagram \u2014 a change noticed by fans who flooded the comments of both musicians\u2019 posts asking if a reunion was in the works.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, neither Nicks nor Buckingham had commented further on the posts.",
      "Nicks confirmed that singer and keyboardist Christine McVie\u2019s death in 2019 meant the end of Fleetwood Mac.",

      "Follow-up tests found no evidence of a serious or life-threatening condition like deep vein thrombosis, she said, but they did lead to a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "What is chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "Normally, oxygen-rich blood is pumped all over the body, including throughout the arms and legs. Veins then send that blood back to the heart to reoxygenate.",
      "Sometimes, veins in the legs become damaged and can\u2019t manage to return that blood as well as they should, according to the Cleveland Clinic. When that happens, blood settles in the legs, leading to a condition called chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "Patients can experience swelling, pain and skin discoloration. Sometimes, ulcers develop.",
      "The condition itself is common, affecting an estimated 1 in 20 adults, usually over age 50. Dr. Lee Kirksey, a vascular surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, said it\u2019s not life-threatening.",
      "It does, however, \u201craise a yellow flag for us to look at underlying issues, whether it\u2019s body weight or whether it\u2019s a sedentary lifestyle,\u201d Kirksey said.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s April 2025 physical, his heart function is normal and \u201cblood flow to his extremities is unimpaired.\u201d His latest physical also says he is 6-foot-3 and weighs 239 pounds, which indicates he is overweight, according to the NIH BMI Calculator. Being overweight or obese is a risk factor for chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "How is chronic venous insufficiency treated?",
      "Dr. Aaron Aday, co-director of vascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said the key is to work those leg veins to get them pumping again.",
      "\u201cWhen we walk, the muscles in our feet and our legs squeeze our veins that help pump blood back to the heart,\u201d Aday said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting or standing, say, on a plane ride or a desk job, that  pressure can build up, causing achiness and heaviness in the legs.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. Wearing compression stockings and elevating legs can be helpful, experts said.",
      "Blood thinners can also help prevent blood clots from forming. Trump takes aspirin, a blood thinner, according to his medical records.",
      "Neither Kirksey nor Aday is involved with Trump\u2019s care.",

      "Jordan, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, has repeatedly and publicly denied any knowledge that the team\u2019s doctor, Richard Strauss, was preying on the athletes.",
      "It will be the first time Jordan has be questioned under oath by lawyers representing hundreds of former OSU students, both athletes and nonathletes, who are suing the school for damages in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio. Jordan is not a defendant, but he is referred to in some of the lawsuits alleging he was aware of the abuse.",
      "Jordan, the powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, is known for his combative questioning of witnesses and for avoiding suit jackets during it.",
      "Reached for comment, Jordan spokesperson Russell Dye released a variation of the statement Jordan\u2019s team has been using since July 2018, when three former OSU wrestlers told NBC News that Jordan was lying when he claimed he did not know that Strauss molested them under the guise of giving physical examinations.",
      "\u201cAs everyone knows, Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Mike DiSabato, who wrestled for Jordan and was the first former OSU student who publicly accused him of having turned a blind eye to the abuse Strauss inflicted on him and his teammates, said he does not expect Jordan to say any more than he already has.",
      "\u201cI assume he\u2019s going to triple down and follow the same script he followed back in 2018 when he went on Fox and denied knowing about any abuse, denied being told of any abuse, never heard the word \u2018abuse,\u2019\u201d DiSabato said.",
      "DiSabato was referring to an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in which Jordan also insisted that he did not hear any locker room banter about Strauss.",
      "Still, said DiSabato, who previously reached a settlement with OSU, he hopes Jordan \u201cwill finally come out and admit that he knew Strauss was doing unnecessary prostate exams, doing unnecessary genital exams, taking multiple showers with athletes, all while being employed by a university funded by the state of Ohio.\u201d",
      "Jordan will sit down for a deposition about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called \u201cSurviving Ohio State,\u201d in which one of the wrestlers he once coached flat-out called him a liar.",
      "Another Strauss survivor, Steve Snyder-Hill, said he will watch the deposition Friday at his lawyer\u2019s office in Columbus. While he is not a former athlete, Snyder-Hill is one of the former OSU students suing the university.",
      "\u201cI expect him to lie under oath,\u201d Snyder-Hill said. \u201cI don\u2019t know a nicer way to put it.\u201d",
      "Snyder-Hill said Strauss abused him at a campus clinic in 1995. He said that what the doctor was alleged to have been doing to young men under the guise of giving physical examinations eventually became an open secret throughout campus, extending beyond the athletes\u2019 locker rooms.",
      "\u201cJordan had a locker two down from Strauss, and Jordan claims he didn\u2019t know?\u201d Snyder-Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d",
      "Strauss, who died in 2005, worked at OSU from 1978 through 1998.",
      "Prompted by allegations from DiSabato and other former OSU wrestlers, the university agreed to an independent investigation by the Perkins Coie law firm, which concluded in 2019 that coaches and athletic administrators knew for two decades that Strauss was molesting male athletes and other students but failed to sound the alarm or stop him.",
      "Jordan\u2019s former communications director, Ian Fury, insisted in 2019 that the report absolved Jordan. All of the coaches and administrators\u2019 names were redacted in the version of the report released to the public.",
      "Fury cited as proof a line in the report that said investigators \u201cdid not identify any other contemporaneous documentary evidence indicating that members of the OSU coaching staff, including head coaches or assistant coaches, received or were aware of complaints regarding Strauss\u2019 sexual misconduct.\u201d",
      "Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized \u201cto each person who endured\u201d abuse at the hands of Strauss.",
      "Several of the lawsuits mention Jordan by name.",
      "Still facing at least five active lawsuits from 236 men alleging Strauss molested them, too, OSU, which had apologized to Strauss\u2019 victims and had reported in 2019 that Strauss committed 1,429 sexual assaults and 47 rapes, walked back its previous position in October 2023 and denied having admitted any wrongdoing. The settlements it paid out were without admission of liability and were reached through mediation.",
      "OSU also argued that the statute of limitations in the case against it had run out.",
      "But in June 2023, the Supreme Court refused to reconsider a lower court ruling that said former students should be allowed to sue OSU, paving the way for their lawyers to question Jordan and other OSU employees about Strauss.",
      "Former Athletic Director Andy Geiger was deposed Wednesday, NBC affiliate WCMH of Columbus reported. Some of the lawsuits refer to Geiger as one of several people whom student-athletes allege they told about the abuse when it was happening.",
      "\u201cWe plan to depose every OSU employee alleged to have known about Strauss\u2019 abuse, including the employees named in the complaints,\u201d Adele Kimmel, director of the Public Justice Students\u2019 Civil Rights Project, said in June 2023."

      "Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham posted matching excerpts from their 1973 song \u201cFrozen Love\u201d on Thursday, prompting speculation among fans that something more may be coming.",
      "Nicks, who is scheduled to begin a solo U.S. tour in August, shared on X a white background image with black cursive text that read, \u201cAnd if you go forward \u2026\u201d About an hour later, Buckingham posted the lyric\u2019s second half: \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d",
      "The lyric is the final line of \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d a track from \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d the only album the two released as a duo before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham \u2014 and more pointedly their tumultuous personal relationship \u2014 remain a pop culture symbol of intense romance followed by even more intense heartbreak, fueled in part by a live performance of \u201cSilver Springs\u201d that has remained a fixture online.",
      "The pair had a complicated personal and professional history \u2014 both as former romantic partners and as bandmates. Their arrival in Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s helped usher the band\u2019s most commercially successful era, but Buckingham was dismissed from the band in 2018, and the pair have not performed together since.",
      "The apparently coordinated nature of the posts, which came just one day after Mick Fleetwood shared an Instagram video of himself listening to \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d raised questions about whether the former bandmates might be planning something together. In the video, Fleetwood removes his headphones and calls the song \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe marriage of Stevie and Lindsey, the marriage of coming into Fleetwood Mac when they did, it\u2019s all in this song,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was magic then, it\u2019s magic now.\u201d",
      "Buckingham and Nicks both liked Fleetwood\u2019s post and recently began following each other on Instagram \u2014 a change noticed by fans who flooded the comments of both musicians\u2019 posts asking if a reunion was in the works.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, neither Nicks nor Buckingham had commented further on the posts.",
      "Nicks confirmed that singer and keyboardist Christine McVie\u2019s death in 2019 meant the end of Fleetwood Mac.",
      "Representatives for Nicks and Buckingham did not reply to requests for comment."

      "GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 In an early preview of a potential 2028 presidential campaign, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear hit the road across South Carolina this week, testing a message focused on how to grow the Democratic coalition.",
      "Beshear laid out a blueprint for the party to win back rural voters, union voters, independent voters and even Republicans \u2014 music to the ears of Democrats still feeling the sting of 2024\u2019s losses and eager to hear about how the party can rise again.",
      "\u201cThe actions of the Trump administration are providing a huge opportunity for Democrats to go out and regain the trust of the American people to be the party of common sense, common ground and getting things done,\u201d Beshear, 47, told union members gathered at the South Carolina AFL-CIO convention in Greenville.",
      "\u201cWhen we deliver and make people\u2019s lives better, they\u2019re willing to vote in different ways. They\u2019re willing to support different people, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to be,\u201d added Beshear.",
      "Red-state credentials: At stop after stop, Beshear noted that he knows how to win voters in traditionally Republican areas. After all, he\u2019s done it twice.",
      "The first time was in 2019, when he won his first gubernatorial election by less than half a percentage point, beating GOP Gov. Matt Bevin. In 2023, Beshear improved his margins, beating then-state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, by 5 points.",
      "Meanwhile, President Donald Trump won Kentucky by almost 26 points in 2020 and by over 30 points in 2024.",
      "South Carolina focus: Though he insisted that his travel to South Carolina came about partly because of his son\u2019s baseball tournament near Charleston, Beshear hasn\u2019t been coy about his presidential aspirations before arriving in the state that voted first in last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primaries.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d just days before he arrived in South Carolina, Beshear said he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at launching a presidential campaign in 2028. He\u2019s at least the fourth Democratic elected official to publicly visit the state this year, arriving just a week after California Gov. Gavin Newsom and several weeks after Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Tim Walz of Minnesota. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., also has an event planned in the state later this week.",

      "Whatever is in the Jeffrey Epstein files, Americans haven\u2019t learned much about the content because the Justice Department hasn\u2019t released them and appears to be in no rush to do so. But the fight over them has told the public a lot about the future of the MAGA movement and President Donald Trump\u2019s place in it.",
      "The truth that grows more glaringly obvious with each passing day is that Trump is a temporary leader of a modern Republican base that fashioned itself in his image. But countless elected officials and right-wing influencers hope to remain prominent once Trump has exited the presidency. Their timeline simply isn\u2019t the same as his.",
      "These folks, from Turning Point USA\u2019s Charlie Kirk to megabroadcasters Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, simply can\u2019t afford to alienate the hardcore MAGA base that is calling for transparency on a matter that speaks directly to their antipathy for powerful institutions and players.",
      "That\u2019s the most logical explanation for echoing criticism of Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi. It\u2019s not that Trump\u2019s longtime allies don\u2019t support his presidency \u2014 Kirk went so far as to say this week that pushing the Epstein issue is done out of love for Trump \u2014 but they aren\u2019t about to risk their own credibility with his voters.",
      "Trump, who watched some of his most prolific backers distance themselves from him on arming Ukraine and bombing Iran, can expect more of the same as his second term progresses. Over time, ambitious figures in the MAGA wing of the GOP are sure to cling tighter to the base than to Trump.",
      "That\u2019s the new reality for a president who faces a constitutional bar to running for another term. The lesson for him is that despite being the most powerful person in the world, his political capital will continue to diminish each time he picks a fight with his own movement.",
      "The Epstein files represent the first major MAGA rift of his second term. If he\u2019s not careful, it won\u2019t be the last.",

      "\u201cRichard has moved on to another race,\u201d Harris said.",

      "The staff shakeup comes as Earle-Sears, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has struggled to gain traction against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman, in the race to succeed GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "A poll released Wednesday by Virginia Commonwealth University found Spanberger leading Earle-Sears 49% to 37% among registered voters. Those results were outside of the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 4.16 percentage points.",
      "And new fundraising reports released this week showed Spanberger with an advantage over Earle-Sears. Spanberger raised $4.3 million during the most recent reporting period, June 6 to June 30, and had $15.2 million in cash on hand. By comparison, Earle-Sears raised $2.4 million and had $4.5 million in cash on hand.",
      "Republicans have criticized Earle-Sears\u2019 campaign, saying that it lacks discipline and consistency. In interviews last month, Republican operatives in Virginia and elsewhere grumbled that the campaign has lacked a central message. But they also cautioned that it remained far too early to write off Earle-Sears \u2014 a message that was reiterated by the campaign itself on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe are at the very beginning of this fight,\u201d said Harris, who noted that Youngkin won four years ago after starting the race behind.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to win and beat Abigail Spanberger,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that everyone is treating this race much like a fait accompli, and I think much like that was wrong in 2021, once again it will be wrong in 2025.\u201d",
      "Harris acknowledged that they \u201cdefinitely are the underdog\u201d but said that \u201cthere is a clear path to victory\u201d for them to win.",

      "On Wednesday, Musk announced a third Grok companion that would emulate the personality of \u201cEdward Cullen from Twilight and Christian Grey from 50 Shades,\u201d referring to the main characters in two book series. After having gone through potential names with users in the comments, Musk settled on \u201cValentine,\u201d after a character from the book \u201cStranger in a Strange Land,\u201d by Robert A. Heinlein.",
      "Musk wrote Tuesday on X that the companions would soon be customizable and that users would be able to create their own custom and unique Companions.",
      "But the over-sexualization of the characters has brought up concerns for some.",
      "The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a child-safety and anti-pornography nonprofit group, expressed concerns about minors having access to the sexualized chatbots, pointing out that users only need to be 12 or older to download the Grok app. The center called on Grok to either remove the explicit content from the app or consult with Apple to change its age restrictions to 18.",
      "\u201cThese AI chatbots might feel like they care, but they don\u2019t,\u201d Haley McNamara, the center\u2019s senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs, wrote in a news release. \u201cAnd while features like \u2018spicy mode\u2019 or flirty avatars might seem like harmless fun, they\u2019re built to create compulsive engagement, through seductive language, suggestive visuals, and escalating emotional intimacy,\u201d",
      "The release drew attention to specific aspects of Ani\u2019s character that could be harmful, including providing \u201cdescriptions of sexual acts she would like to do with the user\u201d and \u201cdisrobing to lingerie.\u201d",
      "These new changes to Grok have taken place as xAI has delved into more serious ventures. The same day that Musk announced the implementation of Companions on the Grok app, xAI also announced \u201cGrok for Government,\u201d which will make Grok AI products available to federal government departments, agencies and offices to purchase.",
      "The Defense Department also announced that it would be granting contract awards of up to $200 million for AI development to xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic and Google."

Do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons without fear of retribution and without favor to the powerful,\" she wrote in a memo Thursday to her colleagues.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday afternoon officially terminated the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u2019s LGBTQ Youth Specialized Services program, which gave callers under age 25 the option to speak with LGBTQ-trained counselors.",
      "The announcement that the specialized service would be shuttered was made last month by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The agency said it would \u201cno longer silo LGB+ youth services\u201d \u2014 notably removing the \u201cT\u201d representing the transgender community \u2014 and would instead \u201cfocus on serving all help seekers.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress. Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help,\u201d the agency stated at the time.",
      "The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline launched in July 2022, two years after President Donald Trump signed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, making 988 the universal number for the national suicide prevention line. The bipartisan legislation noted that LGBTQ youths \u201care more than 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide than their peers and stated that SAMHSA \u201cmust be equipped to provide specialized resources\u201d to high-risk populations, including LGBTQ youths.",
      "The specialized LGBTQ hotline was rolled out in October 2022, initially as a pilot program, receiving between $29.7 million and $33 million annually, according to SAMHSA. Also known as the \u201cPress 3 option,\u201d the program gave 988 callers the option to \u201cpress 3\u201d to connect with a counselor trained to assist lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer youths and young adults (they could also text 988 with the word \u201cPRIDE\u201d). Nearly 1.5 million contacts were routed to the LGBTQ service since its launch, according to data available on the SAMHSA website.",
      "The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth crisis intervention and suicide prevention organization, was initially the sole provider of the specialized service, but eventually seven providers were part of 988\u2019s LGBTQ Youth Subnetwork.",
      "Jaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, called the termination of the service \u201cunfathomable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis administration has made a dangerous decision to play politics with real young people\u2019s lives,\u201d Black said in a statement. \u201cThe 988 Lifeline\u2019s Specialized Services Program was created to serve Americans at highest risk for suicide \u2014 including veterans and LGBTQ+ youth \u2014 with best-practice crisis care that meets these populations\u2019 unique needs.\u201d",
      "The option for 988 callers to press 1 if they are veterans or service members seeking specialized services will remain in operation.",
      "\u201cSadly, more children are going to die in America because of this cut.\u201d",
      "Rep. seth moulton, d-mass.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who co-sponsored the legislation that paved the way for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, spoke about the termination of the LGBTQ youth service in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cKids are going to die,\u201d Moulton said when asked about the termination\u2019s effects. \u201cThis is actually the kind of thing Republicans should care about if they really care about American kids, because an extraordinary percentage of the people who call this lifeline in a moment of crisis say that it saved their lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a veteran, I know how much it means to my fellow veterans to be able to push a button when they call 988 and get connected directly to a veterans crisis counselor \u2014 someone who\u2019s trained to deal with veterans. Well, LGBTQ kids need that, too,\u201d he added. \u201cSadly, more children are going to die in America because of this cut.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just Democrats who criticized the decision to shutter 988\u2019s LGBTQ youth service. At a news conference outside the Capitol on Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., joined several of his colleagues from across the aisle to speak out against the program\u2019s termination.",
      "\u201cThis lifeline has provided help \u2014 it has connected young people with trained professionals who understand what they are going through, and in many cases, it has saved lives,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cCutting a program that is working, that is meeting a real and growing need, just does not make sense.\u201d",
      "When asked for comment about the termination of the LGBTQ service and critics\u2019 claims, a SAMHSA spokesperson pointed NBC News to the agency\u2019s June statement announcing the service\u2019s forthcoming termination.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, of which SAMHSA is a part, said the Press 3 option had run out of congressionally directed funding and added that continued operation of the specialized service would have required reallocating funds away from the main 988 Lifeline, possibly resulting in massive reductions in service.",
      "While 988 has discontinued its LGBTQ youth service, LGBTQ youths and young adults seeking specialized crisis intervention and suicide prevention help can still contact the Trevor Project for such services by calling 1-866-488-7386, texting START to 678678 or visiting TheTrevorProject.org/Get-Help.",
      "Some states are also planning to help fill the gap left by the termination of 988\u2019s specialized service for LGBTQ youths.",

      "\u201cWhile the Trump administration continues its attacks on LGBTQ kids, California has a message to the community: we see you and we\u2019re here for you,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to work with the Trevor Project to ensure that every person in our state can get the support they need to live a happy, healthy life.\u201d"

      "Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham got fans excited about a possible musical reunion after they appeared to exchange messages with one another on social media.",
      "The communication between the two former Fleetwood Mac members is big news for anyone aware of their complicated relationship over the past five decades.",
      "The two exes \u2014\u00a0who famously dated and then broke up while recording Fleetwood Mac's hit 1977 album \u201cRumours\u201d\u2014 recently began following each other on Instagram, a hint that the chill between them may have thawed since Buckingham was fired from the band in 2018.",
      "Nicks got things started July 17 by posting a handwritten lyric from the love song \"Frozen Love\" on her official Instagram and X accounts. She and Buckingham recorded the song in 1973 with their pre-Fleetwood Mac band, Buckingham Nicks.",
      "\"And if you go forward ...\" Nicks wrote.",
      "Not long after, Buckingham responded to complete the lyric in his own handwritten message. \"I'll meet you there,\" he wrote.",
      "Excited fans reacted to the surprise exchange in the comments of both musicians' posts with many wondering if a reunion was in the works.",
      "\"Omg! What is happening?! Is he joining her on tour?!\" one fan said alongside Nicks' post on Instagram.",
      "\u201cStevie never fails to give us hope and magic. I will go wherever a reunion happens,\u201d wrote another.",
      "The hubbub continued on Buckingham\u2019s Instagram, with one fan remarking, \u201cDID WE KISS AND MAKE UP? Oh my god GUYS. WHAT IS HAPPENING?!\u201d",
      "\u201cI will prolong being a home owner if it means I get to watch Silver Springs 1997 happen in real time,\" another added, referring to a video that shows Nicks glaring at her ex while practically spitting out the lyrics of \u201cSilver Springs\u201d during a 1997 performance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you,\u201d Nicks sings, staring at Buckingham.\u201cYou\u2019ll never get away, never get away!\u201d",
      "Nicks and Buckingham met in high school near Palo Alto, California, in the 1960s, according to the Los Angeles Times. Buckingham, a guitarist, invited Nicks to join his rock band Fritz as its lead singer.",
      "The pair later ditched Fritz, became a romantic couple and launched their band Buckingham Nicks. Eventually, they relocated to Los Angeles together where by late 1974, they were invited to join Fleetwood Mac, which was then a British blues band.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham ended their romance while Fleetwood Mac recorded its 1977 album \u201cRumours.\u201d (Their fellow band members John McVie and Christine McVie, who had been married since 1968, also split around the same time.)",
      "Nicks and Buckingham poured their heartbreak into catchy breakup songs that went on to become hits, including \u201cDreams,\u201d written by Nicks, and \u201cGo Your Own Way,\" written by Buckingham.",
      "Over the years, Nicks and Buckingham would continue on in Fleetwood Mac together, although their personal relationship was often in tatters. Both also stepped away from the band at times to focus on their solo careers.",
      "They also traded plenty of jabs in interviews, with Nicks telling Rolling Stone in October 1997 that she \"resented\" that Buckingham wrote in \"Go Your Own Way\" that she was \"packing up, shacking up\" with different men since their split.",
      "\"He knew it wasn\u2019t true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him,\" said Nicks. \"He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, \u2018I\u2019ll make you suffer for leaving me.'\u201d",
      "A final behind-the-scenes incident with Buckingham at the 2018 MusiCares benefit gala held in Fleetwood Mac\u2019s honor was apparently the last straw for Nicks and resulted in Buckingham being fired from the band, the Los Angeles Times previously reported.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham apparently didn't speak again until a celebration of life for their former Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie, who died in 2022 at age 79.",
      "\u201cThe only time I\u2019ve spoken to Lindsey was there, for about three minutes,\u201d Nicks told Rolling Stone in October 2024.",
      "\u201cI dealt with Lindsey for as long as I could,\" she added. \"You could not say that I did not give him more than 300 million chances.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the first two episodes of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" Season 3 ...",
      "Season 3 of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d officially premiered on July 16, and fans already have a lot to discuss.",
      "The highly anticipated start of the show\u2019s final season is jam-packed with Taylor Swift tearjerkers and gasp-inducing moments.",
      "The season opens with a four-year time jump. Belly (Lola Tung) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) are happily together at Finch University, while Conrad (Christopher Briney) is still on the West Coast, pursuing a career in medicine after graduating from Stanford.",
      "But in a shocking turn, Episode 1 ends with the reveal that after Belly and Jeremiah fought and \"broke up\" before spring break, he slept with a girl named Lacie \u2014\u00a0twice.",
      "From Heartbreak to a Proposal",
      "Belly learns about this months later at a fraternity party. Distraught, she throws up outside and tells Jeremiah their relationship will never be the same.",
      "\"She\u2019s, at the moment, feeling a little bit shattered,\" Tung tells TODAY.com in an interview about the Season 3 premiere.",
      "But the betrayal doesn't lead to a breakup. Episode 2 confirms that Season 3 \u2014 so far \u2014 is sticking to the plot of Book 3 in Jenny Han's series.",
      "After she learned that he cheated, Belly and Jeremiah reconcile with an engagement. But the proposal looks different on screen.",
      "In the book, their proposal comes shortly after Belly's freshman year. Season 3 slightly ages all the characters up, with the events of the first two episodes taking place at the end of Belly's junior year of college.",
      "Additionally, in the show, her decision to say \u201cyes\u201d to Jeremiah comes right after Belly\u2019s brother, Steven (Sean Kaufman), is seriously injured in a car accident.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s dealing with a lot of real feelings,\u201d Tung says. \u201cShe\u2019s realizing that things can be repaired with Jeremiah, and he is one of those people that makes her safe.\"",
      "\"When you lose someone, or almost lose someone, that can change things for you and bring you closer to the people in your life that really matter,\" she adds.",
      "Jeremiah's infidelity is notably Belly's second heartbreak at the hands of a Fisher brother. In Season 2, Belly and Conrad tearfully broke up on prom night after he was emotionally distant, leading her to assume he didn't want to be with her.",
      "\u201cThe heartbreak with Jeremiah probably feels like a little bit more like a betrayal,\u201d Tung says. \u201cJeremiah and Belly have been together for a lot longer.\u201d",
      "But both brothers, Tung says, ultimately have the same problem to work on.",
      "\u201cAt the heart of it is \u2026 miscommunication, which is a trait of the Fisher brothers,\u201d Tung says. \u201cI think both (heartbreaks) aren\u2019t because they don\u2019t love each other, but it\u2019s just because of miscommunication.\u201d",
      "The rest of Season 3 will come out over the summer, with a new episode dropping on Prime Video each Wednesday at midnight PT/ 3 a.m. ET until the season finale on Sept. 17.",
      "The official trailer previewed dramatic scenes, like Steven's car crash, and crushing heartbreak, including Belly running away from Jeremiah set to Taylor Swift's \"You're Losing Me.\" But it also teased that while Belly may be engaged to Jeremiah, things with Conrad aren't over.",
      "In fact, in a flashback scene in Season 3, Episode 2, Belly and Conrad coincidentally spend a wintry day together at the Cousins Beach house, leading her to realize, \"A part of me will always love you.\"",
      "Their day involved a \"Casablanca\" rewatch and completing a crossword puzzle \u2014 which many eagle-eyed viewers noticed involved a reference to Jenny Han's second book in her \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" series. The answer to one of the crossword clues came from \"P.S. I Still Love You.\"",
      "\"Being a part of the Jenny Han universe, you always see little Easter eggs. I think it\u2019s so fun and cool that the movie exists in that world,\" Tung says.",
      "While we don't yet know whether Belly's final choice will be Conrad or Jeremiah, the official teaser subtly previewed what those great loves mean to Belly. At the beginning, Taylor Swift's \"Daylight\" played over scenes of Belly and Jeremiah in college, before abruptly shifting to \"Red\" when Conrad appeared on screen.",
      "\u201cJeremiah has always been that sunshine, golden retriever boy and I think 'Daylight' perfectly represents that,\u201d Tung explains of the song. \u201cThen 'Red' has this sort of intensity and passion that maybe is associated with Conrad, and they both represent the emotions that Belly feels for both. They\u2019re both equally strong \u2014\u00a0just different.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\"Stranger Things\" Season 5's official teaser trailer is here, previewing an epic showdown between the crew in Hawkins, Indiana, and the monsters within the Upside Down, led by Vecna.",
      "Introduced as the series' big bad in Season 4, Vecna is a grotesque, humanoid being with psychic supernatural abilities. But how he got that point is much more complicated, as explored in the play \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which opened on Broadway in April 2025.",
      "In the teaser for \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which dropped July 16, Winona Ryder's Joyce and David Harbour's Hopper lead the group of teenagers in the battle against beings like the Demogorgon. Season 4, which premiered in 2022, notably ended with a gateway being ripped opened in Hawkins, leading to the Upside Down world. The final shots of the new teaser suggests Vecna himself will come through that barrier.",
      "\"Found you,\" Vecna, played by Jamie Campbell Bower, says in the chilling final seconds of the clip that teases the series' fifth and final season, which drops its first episodes in November.",
      "Vecna was introduced as the series' big bad in Season 4. It's revealed his real name is Henry Creel, and his telekinetic abilities made him the first of Dr. Brenner's test subjects. Creel is also known as One in comparison to Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven, a number used to specify their order as test subjects.",
      "Henry Creel is also the subject of the \"Stranger Things\" spinoff play, which first opened on the West End in 2023 before also moving to Broadway in 2025. The play opens with Henry as he starts his semester at Hawkins High School. There, he meets a high school age Joyce, Hopper and Bob Newby and strikes up a friendship, and eventual romance, with Bob's sister, Patty. Meanwhile, he has recurrent experiences in another dimension known as the Black Void, where he encounters Demogorgons and the Mind Flayer.",
      "While the play is a prequel, it was written to fit in with the established canon of the show, the play's writer Kate Trefry tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"I was kind of given free rein from there, within the very specific confines of the material that exists already, and then what's coming in Season 5, which is actually a pretty thin needle to thread,\" she says.",
      "Trefry was in the writers room at the same time as she was writing the play, so the stories are \"really in such conversation with each other,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, viewers can understand Season 5 without having seen the play, and people can watch the play without having seen the show, according to Trefry.",
      "\"But I'm really excited to get a chance for it all to be taken in as a whole, because it's all connected,\" she says.",
      "\"There's so much connectivity that I can't talk about but there's so many Easter eggs on both sides, in the show and in the play, that are talking to each other and thematically, it's just all part of a piece of the same story,\" she adds.",
      "One major revelation of the play is that Joyce and Hopper knew Henry Creel before he was Vecna. In fact, Hopper was on the scene of the Creel family massacre. During \"The First Shadow,\" Hopper and Joyce team up to try and prove that Henry's dad, Victor Creel, was behind a series of gruesome animal murders haunting Hawkins.",
      "In Season 4, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Steve (Joe Keery), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Robin (Maya Hawke) investigate the 1959 Creel murders and realize that it wasn't Victor at all, but Henry, and they slowly connect the dots between him and Vecna. While this was happening though, Joyce and Hopper were in Russia.",
      "\"The sneaky thing that we had going for us with Season 4 is that anyone who knew about Henry Creel from the past ... is sequestered in other plot lines,\" Trefry explains.",
      "\"So we have the opportunity to say, they knew about this, and yet they were not available to the teens who have to make the discovery on their own,\" she adds. \"But it's all really a Jenga tower.\"",
      "And as deep as \"The First Shadow\" dove into Henry's origin story, there's still more to mine in Season 5, Trefry says.",
      "\"It was really working the fundamental origin story of Henry and building that into its own complete story, which was the luxury of doing an origin story, of saying you don't have to know who this person is to understand this story,\" she says. \"This is the beginning, and there's more that you'll find out in Season 5 about that beginning.\"",
      "For now, the show is only running on Broadway or the West End.",
      "\u201cI think one of the things that was really important to Kate (Trefry) and the Duffers (Matt and Ross Duffer) and Shawn Levy was how do we bring the same emotional and sensory experience that draws you into an episode when you\u2019re watching it into the theater,\u201d says Josh Simon, vice president of consumer products at Netflix.",
      "Simon, who\u2019s helped bring to life other \u201cStranger Things\u201d experiences like the merchandising of fictional brands from the show or the global \u201cStranger Things: The Experience\u201d tour, says after establishing the \"First Shadow\" theatrical experience on Broadway and the West End, the question now is: \u201cHow do we think about being able to create that same level of spectacle in a way where we can bring it all around the world?\u201d",
      "Simon says the goal is for \"as many people around the world to be able to experience it,\" but there aren't \"imminent plans\" for it.",
      "\"Right now, it's such a unique theatergoing experience, it leaves so many people wondering how do we do some of the things that we're doing,\" he says. \"And I think that's just an element that we really want to preserve.\""

      "If it\u2019s been a minute since you watched Season 2 \u2014 after all, it did premiere two years ago\u00a0\u2014 here\u2019s a full refresher on everything that's happened at Cousins Beach.",
      "What Is \u2018The Summer I Turned Pretty\u2019 About?",
      "\u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d which is based on the book series by Jenny Han, follows the journey of Isabel \u201cBelly\u201d Conklin (Lola Tung) as her family returns to their friend Susannah\u2019s home on the idyllic Cousins Beach every summer.",
      "In Season 1, Belly finds herself in a complicated love triangle between Susannah\u2019s two sons, Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Conrad (Christopher Briney). Trouble unfolds after her brother, Steven (Sean Kaufman), kisses her best friend Taylor (Rain Spencer). On top of everything, Susannah (Rachel Blanchard) reveals toward the end of the first season that her cancer returned, and she doesn't want to go through chemotherapy again.",
      "Despite these complicated dynamics, Season 1 leaves the show\u2019s characters in a hopeful place. Belly chooses a happily ever after with Conrad, her longtime crush. While devastated by Susannah\u2019s diagnosis, she ultimately decides to participate in an clinical trial for treatment, leaving her friends and family optimistic.",
      "What Happens in Season 2?",
      "But when Season 2 opens, everything is different. Susannah has died. Belly is grieving and her grades are slipping. She\u2019s no longer volleyball captain, and she\u2019s not speaking to Conrad or Jeremiah.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in Cousins, Conrad and I weren\u2019t together and Susannah was dead. Nothing would ever be the same again,\u201d Belly says at the start of Season 2\u2019s first episode, set one year after the events of the Season 1 finale.",
      "It is revealed through flashbacks that Belly's relationship with Conrad didn't last long after the summer ended. Jeremiah was deeply hurt when he heard the news, and Belly decided to call it off out of guilt. But this isn't the reason the trio isn't talking at the start of the season.",
      "After their initial breakup, the star-crossed lovers couldn't stay apart. They rekindled their relationship through long phone calls throughout the school year, until they were pulled apart again, causing Belly's connection with both Fisher boys to fracture. The reason for this huge rift remains a mystery when we catch up with Belly at the start of the season.",
      "Episode 1 ends in the present day, as Belly calls Jeremiah to reconcile their relationship. While he picks up, what he has to say to Belly isn\u2019t what she expected. Conrad is missing, and it is up to them to find him.",
      "Belly and Jeremiah put their awkward past behind them to unite and search for Conrad. Of course, their first thought is to check his happy place, the Cousins beach house.",
      "Belly doesn\u2019t reveal to her mom Laurel (Jackie Chung) and Steven what has happened, but luckily, Taylor covers for her. Her goal is to solve Conrad\u2019s disappearance without anyone noticing she is gone.",
      "As Belly grapples with Conrad\u2019s disappearance, she reflects on their time together. The show briefly turns into \u201cThe Winter I Turned Pretty\u201d as Belly reminisces on sneaking away to the Cousins house with Conrad during Christmastime.

      "When Jeremiah and Belly finally arrive at the Cousins house, they are relieved to find that they guessed Conrad's location correctly. But they're immediately met with a new obstacle: Their beloved beach house is for sale.",
      "In Episode 3, it is revealed that Susannah\u2019s half-sister, Julia (Kyra Sedgwick), inherited the house and plans to sell it. Aunt Julia resents her sister and needs the money from the sale. She won\u2019t budge on her decision.",
      "Conrad and Jeremiah\u2019s dad, Adam (Tom Everett Scott), also refuses to help, primarily because none of the adults in the room see how they can realistically afford to keep the house.",
      "But the teens are determined to figure out a way to save the house themselves anyway. Good thing they have back up: Steven and Taylor arrive unexpectedly at the house with a blueberry pie in hand, ready to contribute to the cause.",
      "Through flashbacks, we finally see the full breakdown of Belly and Conrad\u2019s relationship. On prom night, Conrad's demeanor takes a sharp turn. A seemingly cold and icy Conrad forgot Belly\u2019s corsage, and they break up after a tearful fight in the parking lot.",

They take this opportunity to bond with the show\u2019s newest character, Skye (Elsie Fisher), Conrad and Jeremiah\u2019s cousin. Along with their new friend, the crew runs into Belly\u2019s old flame, Cam Cameron (David Iacono), who joins in on the fun.",
      "As the group bonds with Skye, they learn more about Susannah and Julia\u2019s strained relationship. Skye and Julia find it hurtful that Susannah chose to invite her friends to the beach house summer after summer without ever inviting their family. The house is, as a result, a sore point for this side of the family and something that Julia is eager to let go of.",
      "After their fun day on the boardwalk, the teens realize that Aunt Julia locked them out of the house while they were gone. So the crew takes a side quest to spend the night on a golf course, which they access thanks to Cam's mom's job at the Cousins Country Club.",
      "During this detour, Taylor and Steven share an almost kiss as they dance in the club's empty ballroom. Belly also admits to Taylor that she might have some lingering feelings, not for her recent beau, Conrad, but for (gasp!) Jeremiah.",

      "Belly spends the evening navigating the party in Susannah's old roller skates while trying to ease the tension between the two Fisher brothers. While she is convinced that they are only fighting about her, Jeremiah is primarily mad at Conrad for staying at school while he was left to care for Susannah in her final moments.",
      "Eventually, Belly confronts Conrad about their relationship on the beach. The pair agree that they thought they loved each other, but Belly concludes it just \u201cwasn\u2019t enough.\u201d",
      "Struggling to handle the intense feelings, Belly drunkenly calls her mom, asking her to come to the beach house, before falling asleep.",
      "Not only does Belly wake up to a brutal hangover, she also wakes up to a furious Laurel.",
      "Laurel isn\u2019t just mad that Belly lied about her location for days, she's still mad at Belly for her outburst at the funeral. In response to this confession, Belly accuses Laurel of abandoning Susannah\u2019s sons after her death. Shockingly, Laurel slaps Belly, leaving her stunned.",
      "But now that an adult has arrived, everything starts to get patched back together. Laurel convinces Aunt Julia to back out of the sale. She also miraculously convinces Adam to sell the family\u2019s home in Boston to buy the Cousins house.",
      "After the house problem is solved, the character\u2019s remaining issues slowly begin to wrap up: Taylor and Steven share a kiss. Jeremiah and Conrad reconcile and decide to be better about sharing their feelings with each other in the future.",
      "Conrad also decides to live out his dream and transfer to Stanford. But he has one problem before he can do so: He has a biology exam he has not studied for that he must pass. Episode 7 ends with a montage of Belly and Jeremiah helping him cram all night for the big exam. For a moment, it seems like old times, as the trio laughs and shares McDonald's cheeseburgers.",
      "They drive Conrad to his test, but the season isn\u2019t over quite yet. While Conrad is busy taking his exam, Belly and Jeremiah's relationship sees a major development.",
      "As Conrad heads to meet Jeremiah and Belly after his test, he walks out to a shocking surprise.",
      "He finds his brother and ex-girlfriend kissing in front of his car. The season ends with Belly, Jeremiah and Conrad awkwardly driving back home together. Conrad is angry, to say the least, and makes sure that everyone knows it.",
      "The trio eventually shares a motel room together and, in the dark, Conrad confesses to Belly that he still has feelings for her. But, the next morning, he takes everything back.",
      "It seemingly doesn\u2019t matter. Belly is solid in her choice of Jeremiah.",
      "The pair then go to Belly\u2019s volleyball camp, where she hopes to convince her coach to let her back on the team. It works, and all is well again for Belly as she heads into her senior year of high school.",
      "In the final moments of Season 2, Belly is with Jeremiah, the beach house is saved and Conrad is headed to California.",
      "Season 3 picks up four years later."

We can\u2019t listen to music all the time because we\u2019re mic'd up, so I felt like I just missed having my AirPods and driving. Little things like that were things that I definitely was thinking about a lot.",
      "Pepe: Definitely my dog, but I've got to also say family and friends because, if not, they'll be mad. The little things, like driving, listening to music and just walks on the beach. The small things that you take for granted and you're like, \"God, I hate being in traffic for an hour and a half, driving and listening to music.\" But when I was (at the villa), I was like, \"I'm excited to be in traffic.\"",

Because I never thought it was this hard, but it is a lot harder than you could ever imagine.",
      "Iris: Yes, it is. I feel like it takes a lot. It takes a toll on your mind and body. But I feel like our experience at the villa ... we made the best (of it) and we had so much fun being there and meeting everybody and having a great summer.",
      "Pepe: Unique, fun, but hard.",

      "Pepe: I haven't been able to watch the episodes. I've just been with family and taking care of things now (that I'm) outside of it. Think a lot of the things were happening off emotions, inside and outside, which is normal. You grow an attachment to people and you grow a love for certain people. But it is part of it ... I don't think any of us could really be mad at what happened in there. I think we're all just happy to have been able to enjoy the experience.",
      "Pepe: I think at this point, everybody kind of knows we're together, obviously. They know it's very different than normal relationships ... it's just, continue to be with each other and focus on each other and just make sure that we can see this through.",
      "The villa was great. I kept saying it was the best week of my villa experience for sure. And now there's a lot of of ups and downs outside of the world. So, just play them out together and, honestly, just be there for each other no matter what. We were like that in the villa, so there's no reason to change that out here.",

      "Iris: TJ is such an amazing guy. I've had a really strong connection with him and I think that he is the sweetest and he's everything. But, the whole time I was in the villa, I was just thinking, \"I don't want him to think I just moved on really quickly.\" I needed to have some closure with him for sure. That was definitely going through my mind. And the minute I got out (of the villa), I was like, \"We should talk.\" And we got the closure that we needed and we're great.",
      "Pepe: Same response. I think a lot of things end very quickly, right? So you should take the time and get that closure outside of this. You don't want feeling to be hurt, not inside, not outside. So, now that we're outside, you want to make sure that everybody's understanding and happy and that you can move on together.",
      "Iris: I feel so much love and I actually can't believe it. I'm definitely overwhelmed because I'm not used to it, but I feel really loved and really grateful and am glad people are seeing the connection that we have and they're enjoying it and seeing it for what it truly is. And that makes me happy.",
      "Pepe: Definitely. I think I can speak for all of us. We all feel loved because we didn't know what was happening. We went in there with no concept of what was going to happen, just going into this crazy experience to see what happens. And coming out knowing that we're all loved, we're all appreciated. We all have a have a huge support system, you know? Especially how it went down with America getting to vote a lot. We both came in the top four at one point. You just feel loved. That's crazy.",
      "Pepe: I think that a lot of things were done off emotion and it's just what it is. I mean, we did a lot of things off emotion in the villa, and you saw a lot of reactions off just straight emotion as well. It's tough. You grow these attachments with people and you want things to play out the way you want them to play out.",
      "I think a phrase that I kept saying in the villa that I learned in the villa is just \"Let things ride the wave. Let it ride out.\" You never know what's going to happen. So, I don't think anything was ever wrong. I think everything happened for a reason and it led to what it led to."

      "During the first challenge of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7, Nicolas Vansteenberghe raised his hand, approached a blindfolded Olandria Carthen and kissed her. After, he held his hand to his chest as he walked away. Olandria, meanwhile, was left wondering who that was.",
      "For Olandria, that question wasn\u2019t definitively answered until 36 episodes later, in July 13\u2019s Season 7 finale.",
      "\u201cI just wanted the person to come forward and just confess, like, \u2018Hey, I was one that kissed you,\u2019\u201d Olandria tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with Nic.",
      "\u201cI was not standing on business that day,\u201d he chimes in.",
      "Nic and Olandria eventually found their way to each other, but not without the winding road that got them there. Early on in the season, Nic established a strong connection with Cierra Ortega, and Olandria with Taylor Williams. That all changed during Casa Amor, when the guys and girls were separated and introduced to groups of new bombshells.",
      "Olandria was dumped from Casa Amor when she failed to find a connection with a new islander, as was Nic for the same reason at the main villa. But instead of leaving Fiji, they were swept away in a getaway car, taken on a romantic date and given the opportunity to couple up.",
      "In Episode 21, they gave romance a try, even sharing a kiss outside of a challenge in Soul Ties. But they quickly decided they were better off as friends; it was clear other forces and unfinished business were at play.",
      "Though Nic and Cierra rekindled and became exclusive, Olandria and Taylor were hanging on by a thread after Taylor connected with a new islander, Clarke Carraway. Then Cierra abruptly left the villa in Episode 30, when social media clips of her using a racial slur resurfaced. (She since apologized.)",
      "So Nic and Olandria ended up in a couple once more for the final week of \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d What they thought was more of a platonic coupling eventually grew into a romantic one \u2014 a turn of events that delighted the corner of the internet who had been rooting for \u201cNicolandria\u201d from the beginning.",
      "Nic and Olandria were named the runners-up of the season, meaning U.S. viewers voted them the second most popular couple behind winners Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales. As for their relationship now, Nic said July 15 on the \u201cChicks In the Office\u201d podcast that, while they haven\u2019t labeled their relationship, they\u2019re \u201cdoing a lot of things that a boyfriend and girlfriend do.\u201d",
      "Below, TODAY.com caught up with Nic and Olandria to unpack their time in the villa, their first date, life back in the real world \u2014 and the hundreds of Nicolandria edits waiting for them.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Nic: I think through the edits you just feel the aura. Just aura. That\u2019s the first word that comes to my mind.",
      "Olandria: I love it. The edits tell our story beautifully, from beginning to end. And some of them even bring me to tears sometimes, like this is so beautiful. To know that we were unintentionally doing all this, like none of that was forced. We didn\u2019t even know Nicolandria nation was even existing \u2014 like, the producers did an amazing job of not telling us that information.",
      "We just kind of naturally gravitated toward each other toward the end of the experience. And it tells it beautifully through the edit. So I like to rewatch them.",
      "Nic: I think internally there was spark. But externally, I think we just had those connections still. She was coming off of Taylor, and then Cierra was at Casa. So I think with those doors being still open, we weren\u2019t able to fully invest in one another.",
      "Olandria: Definitely, when I was with this guy here. I\u2019ve been way softer. People are like, oh, she\u2019s more touchy feely. She touches him a lot. She seems like, more softer, more feminine. She doesn\u2019t have any guards up.",
      "What moment did I start feeling that? I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019ve always been like that with Nic. He always made me feel so secure.",
      "Nic: I think one of the moments was near the end when we were reading \u2014",
      "Olandria: Oh, yeah.",
      "Nic: She was reading her sister\u2019s letter. I think that was the first time I\u2019ve seen Olandria cry ever. It was a happy cry. So I think that was beautiful, that moment.",
      "Olandria: I think they were both just confirming, like, \u201cWe want this. This has got to happen.\u201d You know, \u201cWe\u2019re so happy that y\u2019all are together. Y\u2019all don\u2019t realize how much support you have on the outside.\u201d I think that\u2019s when Ms. Jennifer offered me to come to dinner.",
      "Nic: It might have been even when my mom hugged her. I think the first question she asked was when are you coming for dinner. The reassurance from our parents, that was the most beautiful thing.",
      "Nic: No, I think up until that moment, obviously I\u2019m supporting whatever decision Taylor makes because I know the decisions he makes (are) from his heart. So leading up to it, I really didn\u2019t know. He invested a lot into both women and just going from his heart. So when he wrote down Clarke, there was nothing more to say to that than him following his feelings.",
      "Nic: I remember arguing with everyone, giving reasons. Standing on business, as they say, and convincing everyone. And it didn\u2019t take much convincing, it\u2019s like the facts are there. This is the person who deserves to have another chance in the villa.",
      "Olandria: I truly felt like all the decisions I made prior to picking Nic, I always considered everyone else in the villa. The person I had a connection with played a very, very big role into everyone\u2019s experience. Everyone loved Taylor. So I felt guilty if I ever wanted to step outside of that and make him seem single and vulnerable and risk sending him home, how the house would feel toward me. Because I feel like the guys were very emotional voters. So I didn\u2019t want to be on the chopping block just because I decided to send their best guy home. Taylor plays a big role within his life and Ace\u2019s life, you know. So I just didn\u2019t want them to have a sour taste in their mouth about me. So I always considered them.",
      "The women, too. Like (Taylor) and Hannah had an amazing bond. Him and Chelley had an amazing bond, too. So I was like, if I make this decision, how would they feel about me? How would they treat me? Because I have to live with these people. I don\u2019t have family here. I don\u2019t have friends here, other than them. So I always considered them while picking Taylor every single time.",
      "So I truly felt like the moment I decided to pick Nic, I didn\u2019t consider nobody but me. I know prior, with the Soul Ties kiss \u2014 the kiss that was heard around the world \u2014 even then, I felt like I owed so much to Cierra and Taylor at the time.",
      "So you know what? Regardless of how the world\u2019s going to view me, regardless of how these people are going to view me, I want this for myself, and that\u2019s just what I went with. I did not care about the noise.",
      "I see the tweets, \u2018Oh, my god, supposed to be a girl\u2019s girl.\u2019 I just blocked all that noise out and just went with what I felt, what I wanted to do. And I\u2019m so happy that I did.",
      "Nic: I felt like that moment was like a Super Bowl. Falcons vs. Patriots. I was down 28-3, and I came back for the win. That moment was grand.",
      "Nic: You know, it\u2019s been two days since villa. So it\u2019s a lot to process. I mean, not just the the Cierra thing, but also life and fans and Americans and just like \u2014 it\u2019s a lot to process. So just taking the time right now to process everything.",
      "Olandria: Absolutely, I felt all of the feels. It was so beautiful.",
      "Nic: You felt the flutters?",
      "Olandria: Maybe (laughs). I did. It was so beautiful. All I could do was just cry. And I\u2019m so happy. Even the viewers, they were even crying. I was like, bro, this is the most beautiful day. This is very perfect for them, because it\u2019s our first time actually hearing from America that you guys wanted this all along. So it was just so beautiful to see that.",
      "Nic: I picked her up over the water. Unlike some people. I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m joking.",
      "Olandria: He\u2019s messy. Stay offline.",
      "Nic: I think everything would have been different. I don\u2019t know exactly what it would be, but every decision we\u2019ve made has led us to here, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything about that.",
      "Olandria: No, I just wanted the person to come forward and just confess, like, \u201cHey, I was the one that kissed you.\u201d Well, he did \u2014",
      "Nic: I was not standing on business that day.",
      "Olandria: He was not standing on business. I was like, it felt scratchy. So I\u2019m looking around the room like, who has a scratchy beard?",
      "It\u2019s so crazy. He tells on the very last day of us being in the villa.",
      "Nic: It was the last week.",
      "Olandria: Why did you hold that secret? And he hates holding secrets. He cannot hold a secret to save his life. And he held that one."

      "The ship was approaching Cura\u00e7ao, and Amy Bradley had been out late with her brother at the ship\u2019s nightclub, according to the FBI. By early morning, she was gone.",
      "The case drew national attention at the time and has continued to surface in internet forums, true crime podcasts and TV specials in the decades since. But Amy Bradley\u2019s disappearance has never been solved. No body was found. No charges were filed. And no official explanation has ever been confirmed.",
      "Now, 26 years later, a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d looks back at her disappearance. Directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, the three-part series revisits key witness accounts and theories \u2014 from possible overboard scenarios to organized trafficking \u2014 while focusing on the family\u2019s decades-long search for answers.",
      "\u201cThe story has so many layers,\u201d Mark tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd when you sit with this family in their home and hear what they\u2019ve been through, you understand why this is a story that deserves to be told.\u201d",
      "A long-unsolved case",
      "Amy Bradley disappeared in the early morning hours of March 24, 1998, as the ship neared the island of Cura\u00e7ao.",
      "She was last seen asleep on her chair on the balcony of the ship\u2019s eighth deck at 4:30 a.m, according to the Curacao police, as reported by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1998.",
      "At the time, Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard Lt. Sjoerd Soethout said, to reporters, she may have fallen from the balcony.",
      "The FBI at the time searched the ship in St. Maarten, its next destination, and an FBI spokeswoman said the agency had \u201cno evidence of foul play,\u201d the AP reported at the time.",
      "The FBI is still offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to Bradley\u2019s recovery.",
      "The family\u2019s theories",
      "In the years since, dozens of explanations have circulated \u2014 including a theory she was kidnapped and speculation that she fell or jumped overboard.",
      "Her family has long believed she was taken against her will and may still be alive, which her parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, and brother Brad Bradley reiterate in the documentary.",
      "The docuseries does not offer a definitive conclusion. Instead, it builds a detailed timeline and walks viewers through how the investigation unfolded and where it hit dead ends. Throughout, the series places the Bradleys at the center of the story, offering a portrait of a family still living with questions. The docuseries also features interviews with people who believe they saw Amy Bradley at various locations in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cThe thing that keeps them going, and kept us going, is that their hope is completely inextinguishable,\u201d Mark says. \u201cAmy is present for them every single second of every single day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single day wasn\u2019t just another day of production, every single day was another day that Amy could be home,\u201d Lott adds.",
      "Ron and Iva Bradley filed two lawsuits on the same day against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in Miami-Dade court. Both were dismissed in 1999.",
      "Telling a story without a conclusion",
      "With no definitive conclusion to Amy Bradley\u2019s case, the filmmakers behind \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d faced a challenge: how do you tell a complete story when the central mystery remains unsolved?",
      "\u201cWe really tried not to present anything to viewers that we didn\u2019t ourselves think was real or credible,\u201d Mark says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fact checking, a lot of information gathering and research that goes into these things so if certain leads had no substance we didn\u2019t put them in the show.\u201d",
      "That approach guided how they structured the series. The episodes aren\u2019t just a string of rumors \u2014 they follow a clear timeline, anchored by evidence, official reports and direct interviews. Each theory introduced in the series, whether involving foul play, accidental death, or human trafficking, is rooted in credible information, but never framed as the definitive truth.",
      "The result is a docuseries that resists sensationalism. Instead of promising answers, it leans into uncertainty, inviting viewers to sit with the discomfort that the Bradleys have lived with for more than two decades.",
      "\u201cYou go into a project like this thinking maybe you\u2019ll land somewhere. And instead, every time we thought we had a theory nailed down, something else would unravel it,\u201d Lott says. \u201cWe\u2019d find ourselves saying, \u2018OK, it\u2019s definitely this.\u2019 And then by the next day, \u2018Actually, no. It might be something else entirely.\u2019\u201d",
      "While they won\u2019t reveal which theory they personally believe, they agree that something shifted early that morning on the ship. \u201cSomething happened that cannot be explained at about 5:45 a.m. on that ship,\u201d Lott says. \u201cThat started the timeline that is not easy to answer.\u201d",
      "Mark adds that the ambiguity has never meant indifference. \u201cWe know there\u2019s more to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so cut and dry.\u201d",
      "By Episode 3, the show has made its position clear: the point isn\u2019t to provide closure, because closure may never come. Instead, it\u2019s about creating clarity around the facts, while honoring the ambiguity that still defines Amy Bradley\u2019s case.",
      "What Amy Bradley\u2019s family is doing now",
      "The final episode of \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d doesn\u2019t offer resolution. Instead, it offers an invitation \u2014 to re-engage with a case that, after 26 years, still holds unanswered questions for her family.",
      "For the filmmakers, this isn\u2019t just a story about one family\u2019s grief. It\u2019s also a story about how collective attention, even decades later, might still help uncover the truth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always excited about getting shows out for the public,\u201d Lott tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful conclusion to a process, but when you meet this family and you hear how present and alive Amy is for them every single second of every single day, the responsibility for getting a show onto the air is about life and death.\u201d",
      "Amy\u2019s family continues to hold out hope. In the closing moments of the series, her mother, Iva Bradley, says they wake up every day thinking \u201cmaybe today,\u201d and go to bed each night thinking \u201cmaybe tomorrow.\u201d",
      "That hope, unshaken after more than two decades, is what the filmmakers say anchored the entire project.",
      "Between moments of uncertainty and unresolved leads, the series returns again and again to the person at the center: a daughter, a sister, a friend. \u201cThis show, more than others, feels communal,\u201d Mark says. \u201cIf we can engage enough people around the world\u2014people who want to do something, people who want to help\u2014we think there\u2019s a real chance something new could come to light.\u201d",
      "For the Bradleys, that possibility is everything. Even now, they believe someone, somewhere, knows something. And they\u2019re still waiting for the right person to speak up."

      "Amaya entered the villa in Episode 4 and off the bat had some tiffs with other islanders. A notable one early on was with Ace Greene, with whom she was coupled and took issue with her casual use of endearments like \u201cbabe.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, viewers grew endeared by Amaya; she shared candid confessionals, embraced her emotions (often by calling herself a \u201csensitive gangster\u201d), referred to herself in the third person (with the adorable nickname \u201cAmaya Papaya\u201d) and dropped plenty of one-liners that make for equal parts meme and life motivation.",

      "Bryan: I think just right from our conversations, they flowed so nice, and just especially on the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge, I\u2019ve instantly seen how misunderstood she was, and I can relate. I felt like I grew up misunderstood in the outside world, and that definitely caught my attention. And once we started talking, I feel like we understood each other right away.",
      "Amaya: I definitely would have to say that my parents played a huge part in that. My father always told me that a strong, confident woman would always intimidate or scare the cowards.",
      "So I knew that it was just more of, like, projection on a lot of people\u2019s part. And instead of just viewing sadness as a weakness, it\u2019s a strength, and we are all blessed to have these emotions. And your girl\u2019s an emotional girl, a sensitive gangster.",
      "Amaya: To be honest, how well she defended herself. That was great to see. But I also saw three people kind of giving her a bad rep for stuff that I see are pearls, because I definitely want a woman that has those things, so I felt like I needed to speak up. They they said something about her calling people \u201cmi amor\u201d and \u201cbabe\u201d and stuff like that, and that\u2019s just how Hispanic people talk. I just felt like them saying something, I had to stand up and say something.",

      "And I would have to say that the power of the tongue is very powerful. And that\u2019s me doing positive affirmations. So there\u2019s a really huge, positive impact on doing that. You should be your own best friend no matter what.",

      "Amaya: To be honest, I let my intrusive thoughts win all the time. Like I really don\u2019t think before I speak. That\u2019s my creativity skill. Like, I\u2019m not the best drawer, but I could definitely just say things.",
      "Bryan: Her creativity is something different.",

      "You came into the world by yourself, you\u2019re leaving the world with yourself, so just literally enjoying your own presence.",
      "Amaya: (Laughs) I literally was always on good energy, high energy. I jog back home, so I wasn\u2019t able to jog in the villa besides my zoomies. So at least I was getting my steps in while doing that, right?",
      "Amaya: No. Amaya Papaya, that really started in the villa. Like one person just said it, and it became a waterfall. Everybody started saying it. And I\u2019m like, you know what? I like papayas, anyway, so why not?",

    "summary": "President Trump rejected a military plan for more comprehensive strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that would have lasted weeks, NBC News has also learned.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 One of the three nuclear enrichment sites in Iran struck by the United States last month was mostly destroyed, setting work there back significantly. But the two others were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, according to a recent U.S. assessment of the destruction caused by the military operation, five current and former U.S. officials familiar with the assessment told NBC News.",
      "The assessment, part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to determine the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program since the facilities were struck, was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials and allied countries in recent days, four of those people said.",
      "NBC News has also learned that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran that would have involved hitting three additional sites in an operation that would have stretched for several weeks instead of a single night, according to a current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials.",
      "President Donald Trump was briefed on that plan, but it was rejected because it was at odds with his foreign policy instincts to extract the United States from conflicts abroad, not dig deeper into them, as well as the possibility of a high number of casualties on both sides, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said.",
      "\u201cWe were willing to go all the way in our options, but the president did not want to,\u201d one of the sources with knowledge of the plan said.",
      "In a speech in the hours after they took place, Trump called the strikes he directed \u201ca spectacular military success\u201d and said, \u201cIran\u2019s key enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\u201d",
      "The reality as gleaned through intelligence so far appears to be more nuanced. And if the early findings about the damage inflicted to Iran\u2019s nuclear program hold up as more intelligence comes in, the United States could find itself back in a conflict there.",
      "There have been discussions within both the American and Israeli governments about whether additional strikes on the two less-damaged facilities could be necessary if Iran does not soon agree to restart negotiations with the Trump administration on a nuclear deal or if there are signs Iran is trying to rebuild at those locations, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said. Iran has long said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful, civilian purposes.",
      "The recent assessment is a snapshot of the damage U.S. strikes inflicted amid an intelligence-gathering process that administration officials have said is expected to continue for months. Assessments of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after the U.S. strikes are expected to change over time, and according to two of the current officials, as the process progresses, the findings suggest more damage than previous assessments revealed. That assessment remains for now the current thinking on the impact of the strikes, officials said.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement. \u201cAmerica and the world are safer, thanks to his decisive action.\u201d",
      "In a statement of his own, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said: \u201cThe credibility of the Fake News Media is similar to that of the current state of the Iranian nuclear facilities: destroyed, in the dirt, and will take years to recover. President Trump was clear and the American people understand: Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cOperation Midnight Hammer was a significant blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities thanks to the decisive action of President Trump and the bravery of every man and woman in uniform who supported this mission.\u201d",
      "Destruction and deterrence",
      "The U.S. strikes targeted three enrichment sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. U.S. officials believe the attack on Fordo, which has long been viewed as a critical component of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, was successful in setting back Iranian enrichment capabilities at that site by as much as two years, according to two of the current officials.",
      "Much of the administration\u2019s public messaging about the strikes has focused on Fordo. In a Pentagon briefing they held in response to reporting on an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that concluded that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back by only three to six months, for instance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked extensively about the strike at Fordo but not the strikes at Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "U.S. officials knew before the airstrikes that Iran had structures and enriched uranium at Natanz and Isfahan that were likely to be beyond the reach of even America\u2019s 30,000-pound GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, three of the sources said. Those bombs, which had never been used in combat before the strikes, were designed with the deeply buried facilities carved into the side of a mountain at Fordo in mind.",
      "As early as 2023, though, there were indications that Iran was digging tunnels at Natanz that were below where the GBU-57 could reach. There are also tunnels deep underground at Isfahan. The United States hit surface targets at Isfahan with Tomahawk missiles and did not drop GBU-57s there, but it did use them at Natanz.",
      "A U.S. official pointed NBC News to a closed-door briefing conducted in late June by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who told lawmakers that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and that several key nuclear facilities were \u201ccompletely destroyed,\u201d according to an administration official\u2019s description of the briefing. Ratcliffe said the only metal conversion facility at Natanz, required for nuclear enrichment, was destroyed to the point that it would take \u201cyears to rebuild,\u201d according to the official, who was authorized to describe some contents of the classified briefing.",
      "Ratcliffe also said that the intelligence community believes the strikes buried the vast majority of enriched uranium at Isfahan and Fordo and that thus it would be extremely difficult for the Iranians to extract it to resume enrichment, according to the official. The United States has not seen indications that Iran is trying to dig out the facilities, two officials said.",
      "As NBC News has reported, the Israeli government believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium remains intact but buried beneath the Isfahan facility, according to a senior Israeli government official who briefed reporters in Washington last week. The official said, however, that Israel considers the material effectively unreachable, because it is watching and will conduct new strikes if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the uranium. The official also said Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back by up to two years.",
      "Similarly, even if the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were not completely destroyed, U.S. officials and Republican advocates of the operation believe it was a success because it has changed the strategic equation for Iran. From their point of view, the regime in Tehran now faces a credible threat of more airstrikes if Israel and the United States believe it is trying to revive clandestine nuclear work.",
      "Asked late last month whether he would consider bombing Iran again if intelligence reports concluded Iran can enrich uranium at a level that concerns him, Trump said: \u201cSure. Without question. Absolutely.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s air defenses have been largely destroyed, making it all but impossible for Iran to defend against further strikes on facilities in the future, the U.S. official said.",
      "\u201cIt was made clear that Iran no longer has any more [air defenses], so the idea that they can easily rebuild anything is ludicrous,\u201d the official said.",
      "The \u2018all-in\u2019 plan",
      "Beginning during the Biden administration, as early as last fall and into this spring, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, had developed a plan to go \u201call-in\u201d on striking Iran, according to a current U.S. official and two former officials. That option was designed to \u201ctruly decimate\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, in the words of one of the former officials.",
      "Under the plan, the United States would have hit six sites. The thinking was that the six sites would have to be hit repeatedly to inflict the kind of damage necessary to completely end the program, people familiar with the thinking said. The plan would also have involved targeting more of Iran\u2019s air defense and ballistic missile capabilities, and planners projected it could result in a high number of Iranian casualties. U.S. officials expected that if that were to take place, Iran would target American positions, for example in Iraq and Syria, a person familiar with the plan said.",
      "\u201cIt would be a protracted air campaign,\u201d the person said.",
      "Some Trump administration officials believed a deeper offensive option against Iran was a viable policy, two of the former officials said.",
      "Trump was briefed on the so-called all-in plan, but it was rejected ultimately because it would have required a sustained period of conflict.",
      "The history",
      "During his first term, in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that was negotiated during the Obama administration. The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, imposed strict limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions.",
      "Under the deal, Iran was a year away from obtaining enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. After Trump withdrew from the accord and reimposed sanctions, Iran flouted restrictions on its uranium enrichment. Before the June airstrikes, the regime had enough fissile material for about nine to 10 bombs, according to U.S. officials and United Nations inspectors.",
      "Trump has since sought a new agreement with Iran that would block it from developing nuclear weapons. Indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials failed to clinch a deal before Israel launched airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "Iran has long denied that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, a position its foreign minister reiterated in an interview with NBC News the day before the U.S. strikes."

      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",

      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "A senior Kremlin official told NBC News that Putin may not rush to respond. \u201cWe need to analyze the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take some time.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the optimism of Ukraine\u2019s supporters will be dictated by what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s weapons deal \u2014 and whether he sticks with his renewed direction of thinking on the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe need to be a bit cautious as to whether this is a sea change in Trump\u2019s opinion or if it\u2019s just another part of a whiplash effect as he veers backwards and forwards,\u201d Matthew Savill, , director of military sciences at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News. \u201cHis overriding goal is to get credit for ending the fighting.\u201d",

Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",

      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",

      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",

      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U.

After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",

      "Ireland is the top source of U.S. pharma imports from the E.U., and serves as the European headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta.",

      "Last year, the total value of E.U.-U.S. trade amounted to nearly $2 trillion.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years,\" a royal source told the newspaper about the meeting.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump will make an unprecendented second state visit to the U.K. in September where he will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom in September along with first lady Melania Trump, where he will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Sunday.",
      "No American president has ever been invited for a second state visit. But Trump, a big supporter of the royal family, was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2019.",
      "On this occasion, however, he will not stay at Buckingham Palace, which is currently undergoing renovations. Instead, he will travel to Windsor Castle, which sits around 30 miles to the west of London.",
      "Trump who shocked reporters and palace pundits in 2018 when he breached royal protocol by walking ahead of the queen, at times blocking her view and giving her his back, said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered the invitation during a visit to the White House in February.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he added.",
      "Second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit to the U.K. normally take lunch or tea with the monarch, as was the case with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.",
      "Although the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, which comes with a full display of pageantry and royal pomp, he does so on the advice of the government.",
      "The announcement comes as Starmer courts Trump's favor on tariff negotiations, which have thrown a wrench in the Labour government's efforts to grow the British economy after it contracted in April amid a record fall in exports to the United States.",
      "Trump last month lowered tariffs on the British aerospace sector to zero, but imports of British steel products continue to face a 25% duty.",
      "On his last visit to the U.K., Trump injected himself into British politics by endorsing Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister and weighing in on negotiations over Brexit. He also continued his public feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, branding him a loser.",
      "Charles could also face challenges with Trump on Canada, since he's also the head of state for the former British colony. Trump has on several occasions threatened to annex Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the state visit invite in May.",
      "In a speech to the Canadian Parliament in May, Charles highlighted the country's \"sovereignty\" and said it was facing a \"critical moment.\"",
      "\u201cThe true north is indeed strong and free,\u201d he said, referring to Canada's national anthem."

    "story": [
      "A 20-year-old American from Florida was beaten to death by Israeli settlers on Friday while visiting relatives in the occupied West Bank, according to his family and the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Sayfollah Musallet, known as Saif, was \u201cbrutally beaten to death\u201d in the town of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya, north of Ramallah, the family said in a statement on social media and confirmed to NBC News. According to the family, a group of settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching Musallet for about three hours.",
      "After the settlers cleared, Musallet\u2019s brother was able to reach him and carry him to the ambulance, according to the statement. However, \u201cSaif died before reaching the hospital.\u201d",
      "A second man, Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was also killed in the same incident, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live in developments built in Palestinian territories that are widely considered illegal by the international community. Since October 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza, violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank has surged, often aided or abetted by Israeli security forces.",
      "Settler attacks include raids on villages, arson targeting homes and farmland, and physical assaults on residents that have regularly turned deadly.",
      "It is currently unclear why the confrontation that killed Musallet and al-Shalabi began.",
      "In response to a request for comment from NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said it was \u201caware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,\u201d adding the department had no further comment \u201cout of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones\u201d of the reported victim.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Friday it was \u201caware of reports regarding a Palestinian civilian killed and a number of injured Palestinians as a result of the confrontation, and they are being looked into by the ISA and Israel Police.",
      "Israel Police and Border Police forces were deployed to the scene \"following reports of a physical confrontation between civilians,\" police told NBC News.",
      "\"Several individuals from both sides were detained at the scene on suspicion of involvement in acts of violence,\" it said. \"A joint investigation has since been opened by the Israel Police and the IDF Military Police.\"",
      "Saif\u2019s cousin Fatmah Muhammed told NBC News on Saturday that Musallet worked in an ice cream shop run by his father in Tampa, Florida. He traveled to the West Bank in June to visit his mother, brother and sister.  Musallet\u2019s father was en route to the West Bank from Florida for his funeral, to be held on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThis news has been devastating for the entire family,\u201d Muhammed said.",
      "Nizar Milbes, a close family friend currently visiting the West Bank from California, told NBC News that many residents of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya are Americans.",
      "The town is known for its olive trees and rolling hills, where many modern Palestinian homes are built, including some of the West Bank\u2019s more opulent houses. Families gathered to barbecue and relax, many of them traveling from the U.S. for vacation, but Milbes said growing settler violence has transformed the area.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over here for people to enjoy, the settlers have taken everything,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even go there anymore. The settlers have burned the vacation homes, they\u2019ve encroached and put their stuff there.\u201d",
      "In March, a United Nations report warned that settler violence had \u201cincreased in a climate of continuing impunity.\u201d",
      "Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, said settlers rarely face legal consequences for violence perpetrated against Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of all investigations were closed without an indictment and only 3% of investigations led to a conviction, according to a report by the organization.",
      "\u201cThe low conviction rate sends the message that the law enforcement system, in its entirety, does not consider settler violence to be a serious issue, contributing to the perpetrators\u2019 sense of immunity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Since October 2023, 961 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to a database maintained by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a sharp rise from previous years.",
      "CAIR-Florida, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nationwide Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned Israeli settlers, \u201cbacked and enabled by the Israeli government,\u201d for Musallet\u2019s death, and called on President Donald Trump to \u201cput America first.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvery other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians.\u201d",
      "In April, 14-year-old American Amer Rabee was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. His family said he was picking almonds, the IDF said he was throwing rocks. In September 2024, Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against West Bank settlements.",
      "American citizens Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour and Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, both 17, were killed by Israeli fire in separate incidents in February and January 2024."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a significant tariff hike on the European Union and Mexico, two of the largest U.S. trade partners.",
      "In separate letters published on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that each country will face a blanket tariff rate of 30% on all goods exported to the U.S. starting Aug. 1.",
      "Trump threatened even higher tariffs if either the E.U. or Mexico retaliate against his new levy.",
      "Writing to Mexico's president, Trump also focused on border security, saying that \"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough.\"",
      "\"Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\" he added.",
      "Trump has spent the past week bringing his trade war back to a roaring boil. He kicked it off by issuing dozens of letters announcing unilateral tariffs, then said he planned to impose 50% duties on copper goods, sending prices of the raw metal to all-time highs. Late Thursday, he announced he would apply a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports, as well as a 35% tariff on some, and perhaps all, Canadian imports starting next month.",
      "The letters come as the many trade deals that Trump administration officials had said would be signed have failed to materialize, leaving Trump with little to show for weeks of negotiations.",
      "While Mexico was spared from Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff rollout on April 2, the 30% rate for the E.U. is 10 percentage points higher than what the president said he would apply to America's largest trading partner in April but lower than his mid-May threat of 50%.",
      "The 27-member European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner \u2014 its $605 billion worth of imports into the U.S. surpassing Mexico, Canada and even China. The most valuable category was drugs and pharmaceuticals, followed by autos and aircraft and other heavy machinery. Trump has already threatened to impose a 200% tariff on any drugs imported into the U.S., though it would not be applied for at least 18 months.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to Trump's letter, saying in a statement that \"few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices.\"",
      "But von der Leyen said she \"will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests,\" including retaliatory tariffs \"if required.\"",
      "Mexico meanwhile is another one of the United States' most important trading partners, with more than $505 billion worth of goods imported by American consumers and companies in 2024.",
      "Mexico made up 69% of U.S. vegetable imports and 51% of U.S. fresh fruit imports in recent years, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. With short shelf lives, produce could see price hikes faster than other goods.",
      "Markets had spent most of the week brushing off the earlier escalations, leaving stocks largely at the record highs they\u2019d regained thanks largely to recent weeks\u2019 trade-war lull. Trump himself touted the gains in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "But on Friday, major indexes closed lower on the heels of Trump vowing to hit Brazil, a key source of commodities like coffee and orange juice, with a 50% tariff. Trump said the tariff was so high because of \"unsustainable Trade Deficits\" even though the U.S. currently runs at a surplus in its trade with Brazil.",
      "Trump also said \"the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro ... is an international disgrace.\"",
      "In the case of the E.U., the bloc currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be quickly implemented. Some of those retaliatory duties target goods made in Republican-represented states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana and bourbon from Kentucky, which is represented in the House and Senate by a nearly all-Republican delegation.",
      "Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "Analysts say the new tariff onslaught adds further risk to an inflation outlook that has already been teetering on edge.",
      "\u201cHigher tariffs going into effect in August also could mean that inflationary effects come through later this year or even into next year, extending the timeline on higher inflation,\u201d analysts with Citi wrote in a note to clients published Friday.",
      "The European Commission, the executive arm of the E.U., has been furiously negotiating toward an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d in order to avoid the outcome of getting hit with one of Trump\u2019s tariff letters.",
      "Speaking on Wednesday before the European Parliament, the E.U.\u2019s top trade official, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said negotiations were happening \u201cevery single day\u201d between the two sides. \u201cCrucially, while other nations faced increased tariffs from United States, the result of the letters that President Trump sent out on Monday, our negotiations have spared the E.U. from facing higher tariffs.\u201d",
      "However, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d noted that the U.S. had \u201cdiffering perspectives\u201d about the international trading relationship.",
      "In the hour leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement, an E.U. official said that while the bloc was \u201cfully locked and loaded to conclude an agreement in principle,\u201d it didn\u2019t \u201chave any update to indicate that that is going to happen imminently.\u201d"
