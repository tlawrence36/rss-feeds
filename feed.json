      "\u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\u201d has topped the domestic box office charts this weekend",
      "Death is not looming for the \u201cFinal Destination\u201d franchise at the box office.",
      "Its sixth installment, \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d drew big crowds to movie theaters this weekend and easily topped the domestic charts with $51 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. The movie earned the same internationally, adding up to a $102 million global debut.",
      "The same enthusiasm did not meet Abel \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d Tesfaye\u2019s experimental thriller \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d which opened outside of the top five with an estimated $3.3 million.",
      "\u201cIt was always going to have a tough time coming up against \u2018Final Destination: Bloodlines,\u2019\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThere was a lot of buzz.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\u201d opened in 3,523 locations riding in on a wave of strong reviews (93% on Rotten Tomatoes) and viral marketing tactics, including a picture of logs on the back of trucks \u2014 a callback to one of the more infamous \u201cFinal Destination\u201d death traps.",
      "\u201cFinal Destination's\u201d win effectively revives a 25-year-old franchise that hasn\u2019t had a new film since 2011. It also continues a hot streak for Warner Bros., which has had near back-to-back hits in Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cA Minecraft Movie.\" All three were in the top five this weekend.",
      "Disney\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts\u201d landed in second with $16.5 million, pushing its global total to over $325 million. \u201cSinners\u201d placed third with $15.4 million, bringing its global total to $316.8 million. \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\" which has made $928.6 million globally, added $5.9 million. Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d rounded out the top five.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d opened in sixth place. The film, which Tesfaye co-wrote and Trey Edward Shults directed, is a kind of companion piece to his album and tour. He plays a fictionalized version of himself as an insomniac musician. Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan also star.",
      "Neither critics nor audiences greeted it kindly: It carries a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes and was slapped with a C- CinemaScore. AP music writer Maria Sherman wrote that it\u2019s \u201can exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate only handled the release of the R-rated film, which opened on over 2,000 screens and its $3.3 million was enough to make it a profitable deal for the studio.",
      "Next weekend could be a big one for movie theaters as \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning\u201d and the live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d both open nationwide. The overall domestic box office remains up nearly 15% from last year.",
      "\u201cThis weekend is the perfect opening act for what could be one of the biggest Memorial weekends at the box office ever,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "Several highly praised singers who had been tipped to win fell short, including French chanteuse Louane and soulful Dutch singer Claude.",

      "This year\u2019s contest was roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Raphael \u2014 a survivor of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on a music festival in southern Israel that triggered the Gaza war \u2014 was met by a mix of cheers and boos as she sang.",
      "Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR said a man and woman were stopped as they tried to climb over a barrier to the stage at the end of her song. It said a crew member was hit by paint thrown by the pair. Raphael's team said she was left \u201cshaken and upset.\u201d",

      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Wes Anderson isn\u2019t driving the bus. Laurent is. That\u2019s the name of the driver who\u2019s bringing Anderson, and his bus, to the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "As they drive from his home in Paris to the South of France, Anderson explains by phone: \u201cI don\u2019t drive the bus. You have to have, like, four years of training and an EU bus driver\u2019s license. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to drive a bus like this, you\u2019ve got to be able to drive it in reverse, too.\u201d",
      "For years, Anderson has, in favor of the normal festival cars that shuttle guests, brought his own bus to Cannes so his whole cast can arrive together at the premiere. On Sunday, Anderson and company (including Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson and Bryan Cranston) will pile in for the premiere of Anderson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s another example of how Anderson has made something quite unusual into a regular tradition.",
      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d There are variations. Some are expansive family dramas (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Some are more intimate (\"Rushmore\"). Some are more densely layered (\"Asteroid City\").",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a leaner tale which Focus Features will release May 30, is Anderson working in high comic gear. A playful and poignant kind of thriller, it stars Del Toro as the tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda, who decides to name his daughter, a novitiate (Threapleton) heir to his dubiously accrued fortune.",
      "The wheels keep turning for the 56-year-old Anderson. But there are signs of time passing, too. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris is hosting an Anderson retrospective, as well as an exhibition of props, costumes and artifacts from his expansive personal archive.",
      "Anderson, who has a 9-year-old daughter with his wife, the costume designer Juman Malouf, spoke about those things and others on his way to Cannes to unveil \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" a movie that adds yet another fitting mantra to the world of Wes: \u201cWhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d",
      "ANDERSON: We\u2019ve been keeping this stuff for so long. The experience of doing it was kind of great. I\u2019d sort of get pulled over there to approve things. And my reaction was, \u201cWell, we have more stuff.\u201d So we kept adding things. My daughter has lived with a lot of this stuff. The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "Ex-NFL star Antonio Brown says he was briefly detained by police following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside Adin Ross\u2019 celebrity boxing event in Miami",
      "MIAMI -- Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police early Saturday following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, according to the former NFL star and video posted to social media.",
      "Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene.",
      "The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved.",
      "Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter.",
      "Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer.",
      "Brown posted on social media that he had been \u201cjumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",
      "\"Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Brown's statement did not mention the gunshots.",
      "Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season.",
      "He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers\u2019 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",

      "BASEL, Switerland -- The world\u2019s largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final on Saturday of the Eurovision Song Contest, a celebration of music and unity ruffled by discord over Israel\u2019s participation.",
      "A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "French chanteuse Louane has risen up the odds with \u201cmaman,\u201d as has Dutch singer Claude with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d and Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman with the innuendo-laden \u201cIch Komme.\u201d Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash is also a contender with his highly caffeinated dance-pop song \u201cEspresso Macchiato.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Acts from 26 countries \u2014 trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals \u2014 will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent\u2019s pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who are given 3 minutes to make their mark.",
      "Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, both musically and linguistically. There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese.",
      "\u201cIn the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,\u201d he said. But in the past decade \u201cwe\u2019ve seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.\"",
      "\u201cIn recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn\u2019t succeeded,\" he added. \"An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including last year\u2019s winner Nemo of Switzerland, have called for Israel to be excluded.",
      "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.",
      "The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, subsequently tightened the contest\u2019s code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision\u2019s values of \u201cuniversality, diversity, equality and inclusivity\u201d and its political neutrality.",
      "Performers say the backstage vibe this year is more relaxed.",
      "After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country\u2019s flag.",
      "Axel \u00c5hman, one third of favorites KAJ, acknowledged that it\u2019s tough to keep Eurovision an unpolitical event.",
      "\u201cThe world always seeps in in some sense,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to represent Sweden and we have prepared for this for all our lives and want to make the best of our moment as artists in this huge and legendary competition.",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

      "CANNES, France -- You can get nostalgic about almost anything at the Cannes Film Festival, even Jerry Seinfeld on a zip line in a bumblebee costume.",
      "For many years, Cannes has played host not just to an endless stream of artistically ambitious movies, but also to some of Hollywood's most extreme promotional gambits. With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

      "Together, the decisions sent a message France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.",
      "For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema\u2019s \u201csacred monster\u201d \u2014 a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility, and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",
      "France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction with a long-held belief in \u201cl\u2019exception culturelle.\u201d That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct and the art excuses the artist. Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing.

      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",

      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",

      "The 69th Eurovision Song Contest is approaching its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel",
      "BASEL, Switzerland -- There has already been triumph and tears, singing onstage and in the streets, and a touch of political division, as the 69th Eurovision Song Contest approaches its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel.",
      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday. Another six automatically qualified for the final: the host, Switzerland, and the \u201cBig Five\u201d that pay the most to the contest \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.",
      "The 26 countries competing Saturday, in order of performance, are: Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Spain, Ukraine, the U.K, Austria, Iceland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece, Armenia, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, France, San Marino and Albania.",
      "Favorites, according to oddsmakers, are KAJ, representing Sweden with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a jaunty serenade to the sauna. Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",
      "Eurovision has a reputation for campy europop with nonsense lyrics \u2014 past winners include \u201cLa, La, La\u201d and \u201cBoom Bang-a-Bang.\u201d But It has also produced some enduring pop classics. And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",
      "This year\u2019s finalists range from Lithuanian emo rockers Katarsis to a power ballad Spanish diva Melody and Ukrainian prog rockers Ziferblat.",
      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",
      "Vuletic said viewers these days want \u201cmore authenticity in Eurovision entries.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want a standard pop song sung in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to also see something about the culture of the country that the song represents.\u201d",
      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- The man convicted of stabbing Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022, leaving the prizewinning author blind in one eye, is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Strouse died at his home in New York City, his family said through the publicity agency The Press Room.",

He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",

      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",

      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "Hundreds of writers, editors and publishers have gathered for PEN America\u2019s annual gala hosted by Amber Ruffin and featuring a tribute to actor-publisher Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amber Ruffin looked out upon hundreds of writers, publishers and editors gathered for PEN America's annual gala and shared her experience of being on the receiving end of censorship.",
      "\u201cI'm officially a banned book,\u201d the comic-writer joked, referring to her being dropped as a speaker at April's White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cThey booked me and then they banned me.\u201d",
      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "Diaw said Brown cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",

The Grammy and Oscar winner is launching his second headlining tour, promising fresh sounds for his forthcoming album and material from his latest project, \u201cBeethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1).\u201d",
      "Batiste announced Thursday that his Big Money Tour: Jon Batiste Plays America will begin Aug. 27 in Kansas City. He'll groove through more than 30 venues across the U.S. in cities like Detroit, Austin, Texas, Nashville, a co-bill with Diana Ross in St. Louis and Philadelphia, before closing in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 31.",
      "For the first time, Batiste will grace the stages of the Encore Theater in Las Vegas and the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. He hopes the tour will offer attendees a deeper connection to him as an artist for the tour, a nod to his ninth studio album.",
      "\u201cEvery show is both an origin story and a manifesto,\u201d said Batiste, a seven-time Grammy winner who won an Oscar for his work on \u201cSoul\u201d in 2020. The tour comes on the heels of performing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl and \u201cBeethoven Blues,\u201d which reimagined the famed German pianist\u2019s work and debuted No. 1 on Billboard's classical albums chart.",
      "Batiste, a Louisiana native, is known for his signature rich blend of R&B, hip-hop, swing, jazz and pop. He's also the former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d",
      "The multitalented musician will wrap up his intimate Maestro Tour shows on Monday in Los Angeles.",

      "Batiste believes his unreleased music can still forge a connection, even with those hearing it for the first time.",
      "\u201cI try to tell the most up-to-date origin story through the set,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come to the show and you don\u2019t know any of the music, or you don\u2019t know anybody on stage and it\u2019s your first time seeing me perform or seen me on television, you\u2019ll leave and feel like you know the songs. You\u2019ll connect with the artist, the human being and the movement. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re going to see a play.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the tour will mark the beginning of his \u201cnext era\u201d of music. He views the live performances as an opportunity to introduce new material to audiences, allowing the songs to evolve through connection before ultimately recording them for his forthcoming album.",
      "Tickets will be available through artist presales beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the music to a point where you and your community and everybody is acquainted with the sound and feeling of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve explored every aspect of it. You\u2019ve arranged and rearranged, then go record and share it, versus the opposite, which is most often the case. It\u2019s fresh and brand new. Then you go on tour, and you start discovering things in the music on stage you didn\u2019t even know were there in the studio.\u201d",
      "Along with introducing fresh sounds, Batiste said he'll incorporate some improvisation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to find a space in the show where there's improv,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's at the heart of what I\u2019m all about in trying to represent the cultural music that I come from. I really take a responsibility to push forward. This is about bringing people together, channeling the moment and communal expression.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Actor Daniel Dae Kim more than made the nominee list for the Tony Awards",
      "The first monologue Daniel Dae Kim ever performed was by David Henry Hwang.",
      "He had to do one for his college summer program at the National Theater Institute in Connecticut. Kim chose a scene from \u201cFOB,\" Hwang's play about the assimilation struggles of a Chinese American. So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",
      "Known for TV series such as \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d Kim, 56, is the first Asian nominee in the category of best leading actor in a play in the Tonys\u2019 78-year history for his work in a Broadway revival of Hwang\u2019s \u201cYellow Face.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can imagine a lot of things, but I did not imagine this scenario with David,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat I would be in a play with him, that we would both be nominated for Tony Awards and we would be able to call each other friends.\u201d",
      "In the semi-autobiographical show, which ran last fall at the Roundabout Theatre Company, Kim played a satirical version of Hwang. The show also scored nods for best play revival and best performance by a featured actor in a play for first-time nominee Francis Jue, an original 2007 cast member.",
      "You could not have scripted a better ending for a play that was written in response to the musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d casting white actors as Asian characters.",
      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "South Korean artist BIBI has released her sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE,\u201d blending genre-defying sounds with philosophical themes",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean artist BIBI released her highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d on Wednesday, delivering a project that blends her signature genre-defying sound with philosophical twists.",
      "The singer, songwriter and actor, who moves fluidly between pop, R&B, hip-hop and electronic music, has built a reputation for her bold, unapologetic presence in an industry often defined by careful image management. Her latest album features 14 tracks, including six new songs alongside previously released hits like \u201cBam Yang Gang\u201d and \u201cDerre.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, BIBI explained the meaning behind the album\u2019s lead single \u201cApocalypse,\u201d which carries a more poetic Korean title meaning \u201cThe Apple Tree of the End Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought, if there was the fruit of knowledge of good and evil at the beginning, then this would be the apple tree at the end of times,\u201d BIBI said.",
      "\u201cYou know that saying \u2014 when asked what you\u2019d do if the world ended tomorrow, some say they\u2019d plant an apple tree, others say they\u2019d have an orgy. ... But to me, they felt like the same thing. Both are, in essence, acts of planting seeds.\u201d",
      "Her interpretation, merging ideas of creation, pleasure, and existential finality, may come across as provocative in a conservative South Korean society where open discussions about sex remain rare and often taboo.",
      "\u201cIn reality, everything has an end, and what each person chooses to do in that moment is their own,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be labeled as good or bad. After all, isn\u2019t the very idea of good and evil ambiguous?\u201d",
      "One of Korea\u2019s fastest-rising stars with a growing international presence, BIBI reflected on the surprising success of \u201cBam Yang Gang.\u201d The song, which means a chestnut jelly snack in Korean, became a viral sensation in South Korea last year while she was too busy to notice.",
      "\u201cI was filming two dramas simultaneously, so I was really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really feel it at that time. Actually, I felt it more this year because people introduce me saying, \u2018Last year was the year of Bam Yang Gang.\u2018\u201d",
      "Despite her growing popularity, BIBI aspires to maintain an element of \u201cambiguity\u201d in her artistry.",
      "\u201cI want to be a mysterious artist. Like \u2018Gacha!\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling. Like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get from a Gacha machine,\u201d she explained, referencing the Japanese toy vending machines known for their randomized collectibles.",
      "The album includes \u201cPygma girl,\u201d a track that reimagines the Greek myth of Pygmalion by reversing traditional muse-artist dynamics, suggesting the subject is the art itself rather than merely inspiring the creator.",
      "\u201cMidnight Cruise,\u201d another standout track, was written after she dreamt about her late grandfather before her Coachella performance in 2024.",
      "BIBI will kick off her first global tour in Seoul on May 16, before heading to the United States and Canada. She will then continue across Asia, with stops including Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The tour will conclude in Australia and New Zealand this October.",
      "\u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d is out now.",

      "One would think the job of making the NFL schedule has got somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture",
      "NBC Sports president Rick Cordella put it best when summarizing what the NFL's scheduling department goes through each year.",
      "\u201cI have five kids at home and you never satisfy them all. Just try and do your best, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d Cordella said Wednesday afternoon after he had a chance to look at the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d slate for the upcoming season. \u201cThey have really, really hard jobs. I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

    "story": [
      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",
      "\u201cI tend to hear the expression that, \u2018I haven\u2019t gone in the water since \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",
      "If \u201cJaws\u201d were made today, he doesn't think it'd have the same effect. But in the 1970s, \u201cit was just perfect in terms of generating this level of fear to a public that was largely uneducated about sharks, because we were uneducated. Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- An alligator that appeared in numerous TV shows and films over three decades, most notably the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d has died at a gator farm in southern Colorado.",
      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",
      "But his most famous role was in \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d a film about a failed and ill-tempered hockey player who discovers a talent for golf. The title character played by Sandler confronts Morris after hitting a golf ball that ends up in the gator's mouth.",
      "Sandler posted a tribute to Morris on Instagram on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers \u2014 really anyone with arms or legs \u2014 but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film,\" Sandler wrote. \"The day you wouldn\u2019t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris' body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\" the farm posted on Facebook on Monday.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "The lawsuit filed April 1 by 23 states and the District of Columbia sought to immediately halt $11 billion in cuts, alleging that it would decimate public health infrastructure across the country. The money, allocated by Congress during the pandemic, supported COVID-19 initiatives and mental health and substance abuse efforts.",
      "The injunction only applies to the states involved in the lawsuit. The federal government must file documentation that they're complying with the order by Tuesday evening.",
      "Health departments across the country have said they've laid off employees after the Trump administration began to clawback the money in late March.",

      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A judge on Tuesday ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs the federal government implemented in a unit of a small U.S. health agency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

      "U.S. health officials say they plan to phase out fluoride-containing supplements used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, citing possible health risks",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",

      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

      "Around 10,000 protesters have gathered in Hungary's capital to oppose a bill by the country's right-wing government that critics say targets free speech and independent media",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- A mass protest in Hungary on Sunday drew around 10,000 people in what some demonstrators called an act of resistance against recent actions by the right-wing populist government to restrict basic rights and crack down on independent media.",
      "The protest, the latest in a recent wave of anti-government demonstrations, came days after a lawmaker from the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n submitted a bill that would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize and potentially ban media outlets and non-governmental organizations it deems a threat to the country's sovereignty.",
      "The bill, which has been compared to Russia's \u201cforeign agent\u201d law, is expected to pass in the parliament where the ruling Fidesz party holds a two-thirds majority. It is seen by many of Orb\u00e1n's opponents as among the most repressive policies the long-serving leader has leveled at his critics in the last 15 years of his rule.",
      "Protesters on Sunday filled the square beside Hungary's parliament in central Budapest to denounce the bill, which would allow the government to blacklist organizations that receive any amount of financial support from outside Hungary, and subject them to intrusive monitoring, searches, major fines and possible bans on their activities.",
      "Politicians in Orb\u00e1n's party, as well as the Sovereignty Protection Office, a controversial government body tasked with identifying alleged threats to Hungary's sovereignty, have specifically identified numerous media outlets and anti-corruption organizations that they claim are serving foreign interests.",
      "From a stage at the protest on Sunday, speaker Jakab T\u00f3th said the bill submitted this week \"is nothing more than a threat, a threat against people being able to express their opinions clearly and freely.\u201d",
      "T\u00f3th added he believes the government has a responsibility to protect the sovereignty of citizens to exercise free speech and take part in public life. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t belong to all of us, if not all of us are free, then sovereignty is solely and exclusively the sovereignty of the government,\u201d he said.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who polls show faces the most serious challenge yet to his power in elections scheduled for next year, has claimed that foreign interests, primarily originating in the United States and in neighboring Ukraine, have sought to instrumentalize independent media outlets and anti-corruption watchdogs in Hungary to influence public opinion with the aim of toppling his government.",
      "Those organizations have vehemently denied such claims, and argued that the work they perform is done to professional standards and in the public interest.",
      "Orb\u00e1n has for years enacted crackdowns on NGOs and independent media, passing laws that critics say seek to stigmatize and obstruct groups that provide protection for women and minorities, offer legal and human rights assistance and expose official corruption.",
      "Those efforts ramped up in 2023 when Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing populist government launched the Sovereignty Protection Office, an authority tasked with investigating organizations and media outlets it deems to be exerting foreign influence.",
      "The bill introduced last week outlines a broad definition of what constitutes a threat to sovereignty. Organizations may be targeted if they oppose or portray in a negative light values such as Hungary\u2019s democratic character, national unity, traditional family structures, or Christian culture \u2014 suggesting that even legitimate criticism of government policy could be treated as a national security threat.",
      "Sunday's demonstration came after two-and-a-half months of weekly protests against an anti-LGBTQ+ law passed in March that banned Pride events and allows authorities to use facial recognition software to identify individuals attending the festivities.",
      "Hungary's government has argued its policies on LGBTQ+ rights are necessary to protect children from it calls \u201cgender madness.\u201d But many critics believe the measures were designed to stir up animosity against sexual minorities and help Orb\u00e1n mobilize his right-wing base ahead of next year's elections.",

      "More than 2,600 contenders are vying for 881 positions in Mexico's first judicial election on June 1",
      "MEXICO CITY -- What do an activist searching for missing Mexicans, an attorney who once represented a drug lord and a university professor trying out TikTok have in common?",
      "They are all campaigning for positions in Mexico\u2019s first judicial election on June 1.",
      "More than 2,600 contenders are vying for 881 positions from Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court down to district courts across the country. In 2027, another election is planned to elect 800 more judicial positions.",
      "Those on the June 1 ballots won a lottery after being screened by committees made up of people from the three branches of government.

      "Here are some of the candidates:",
      "Age: 41",
      "What\u2019s she known for? She is among the hundreds of Mexicans searching for a missing relative, in her case a brother who disappeared in 2014.",
      "Candidate for: District judge in the western state of Sinaloa.",
      "Quiroa\u2019s experience has been different to most other candidates' in that she\u2019s more accustomed to being on the victims\u2019 side.",
      "After her brother disappeared in the northern border state of Tamaulipas, Quiroa began searching and eventually founded a collective called \u201cMarch 10\u201d for the day he vanished.",
      "She quickly realized there was little legal help available to help searchers like herself, so she left her engineering career and began to study law while continuing her search.",
      "Quiroa gained notoriety a couple years ago when she proposed criminal groups consider a peace treaty to make it safer to search for the missing and she began selling a \u201cSearcher Barbie\u201d to raise money for her group\u2019s activities.",
      "Late last year, she decided to return to her native Sinaloa state to compete to be a judge.",
      "Quiroa knows the risks of being a judge in the violent state, home to a powerful cartel of the same name, but she said that there need to be more judges who empathize with those searching for missing loved ones.",
      "\u201cIf I become a judge, I\u2019m not going to send legal documents and wait for authorities to answer when they feel like it,\u201d Quiroa said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out and look for the missing people.\u201d",
      "Age: 40",
      "What\u2019s he known for? He went viral as \u201cJustice Pork Rinds.\u201d",
      "Candidate for: Supreme Court.",
      "Until the campaign started, Guerrero wasn\u2019t well-known outside of Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, where he has taught classes for more than a decade. He had also led Mexico City\u2019s public records agency and worked at the capital\u2019s electoral court.",
      "But it was a homemade TikTok video that took off and launched Guerrero\u2019s campaign. In it, a student hands him a platter of a typical pork rind dish. Playing on the turn of phrase, he says he\u2019s \u201cmore prepared than a pork rind\u201d to be a Supreme Court justice, before rolling into his qualifications.",
      "Some grumps accused him of turning the race into a circus, but Guerrero said that his attempt at humor was far less harmful than having a corrupt justice on the highest court.",
      "\u201cYou have to be colloquial sometimes in your use of language,\u201d he said, accepting that he has tried to run a \u201cdisruptive\u201d campaign.",
      "If elected, Guerrero said that he would push to have the court hold hearings around Mexico to have more contact with people.",
      "Age: 51",
      "What\u2019s she known for? She represented drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n in 2016.",

      "Some critics of electing judges, and a human rights litigation group called Defensorxs, have labeled Delgado Garc\u00eda \u201chigh risk,\u201d because \u201cshe defends alleged drug traffickers.\u201d",
      "The group has also identified 17 other candidates that way for being prosecuted, being members of investigated organizations, for alleged human rights violations and deals with criminal groups.",
      "\u201cEveryone has a right to an effective defense,\u201d Delgado Garc\u00eda said about her decision to represent Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "She notes that she only helped at one hearing where the power went out, and her job was to visit him in the Ciudad Juarez prison where he was being held.",
      "\u201cIf they give me a client of that magnitude, in terms of resume that\u2019s going to help me,\u201d she said.",

There, he sets up a small stand from which he hangs three papers on which he has handwritten his name, the position he seeks, his social platform handle and his ID number for the ballot.",
      "Even though he frequently goes unnoticed by the multitude of street vendors, tourists and workers crossing the square each day, Tapia Maltos dressed in white shirt, tie and dark slacks, occasionally draws the attention of those curious enough to stop and read his papers. Some then ask how they can vote.",
      "The simplicity of his campaign is its most noteworthy characteristic.",
      "\u201cI'm not trying to make a big production with videos, no dancing or anything like that ... Because what I'm trying to do is get to know people in an appropriate way.\u201d",
      "He has worked for years behind the scenes inside the Supreme Court in preparing decisions. Now, thanks to the new judicial election, he says that he has found a way to achieve his dream of being a judge and bring new blood to a judiciary long criticized as corrupt.",

      "Votes are being cast across Buenos Aires in local elections that will test Argentina's President Javier Milei\u2019s political strength as he seeks to steer mainstream conservatives toward his radical libertarian platform",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Votes were being cast across Buenos Aires on Sunday in local elections that will test Argentina's President Javier Milei's political strength as he seeks to steer mainstream conservatives toward his radical libertarian platform.",
      "The election results could boost Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party, or LLA, in crucial national midterms later this year. Some 2.5 million people are eligible to vote in Sunday\u2019s election, in which half of the 60 legislative seats are up for grabs.",
      "A former TV pundit known for his angry rants against Argentina's political class, Milei founded LLA just four years ago, drawing a motley crew of political novices into his anti-establishment agenda.",
      "Seeking to take a \u201cchainsaw\u201d to state spending with just a tiny minority in Congress over his past 1 1/2-year in office \u2014 his party holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% in the Senate \u2014 Milei has been compelled to compromise with former President Mauricio Macri, the scion of a wealthy family and the face of Argentina's conservative political establishment.",
      "That uneasy alliance has faltered in recent months. The two have clashed over Milei's effort to install a judge embroiled in corruption scandals on the Supreme Court, among other things.",
      "In Macri\u2019s stronghold of Buenos Aires, where his PRO (Republican Proposal) party has governed uninterrupted since 2007, Milei appears set on crushing his erstwhile partner altogether, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to claim dominance and the leadership over the whole spectrum of the center-right,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, managing director of Buenos Aires-based political consultancy Cefeidas Group.",
      "At his closing campaign rally last week, Milei attacked Macri's party in an expletive-sprinkled rant. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste time describing all the inconsistencies of the failed (PRO) party because they\u2019re fighting for fourth place,\u201d he told supporters.",
      "Wiping out PRO in Buenos Aires would signal a major shift in Argentine politics \u2014 one already playing out in the United States, Europe and around the world as increasingly right-wing factions push their way into the mainstream and drown out more moderate voices.",
      "It would also cement Milei's party as the main alternative to the country's left-wing populist Peronist faction, which has governed economically troubled Argentina for much of the past two decades.",
      "\u201cIf Milei wins in the capital, it will have a very strong symbolic impact,\u201d said Orlando D\u2019Adamo, director of the Center for Public Opinion at Buenos Aires\u2019 University of Belgrano. \u201cIf PRO wins, it would maintain Macri\u2019s power as a valuable partner, boost his brand and put him on equal footing with La Libertad Avanza.\u201d",
      "Milei has chosen a prominent figure \u2014 his spokesperson Manuel Adorni \u2014 to head his list of candidates. He put his sister and closest advisor, Karina Milei, on the job as a campaign strategist. Huge banners declaring \u201cAdorni is Milei\u201d blanket the city.",
      "\u201cIt has turned into a crucial battle for the political leadership,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a senior analyst at research group Medley Global Advisors.",
      "Macri, for his part, has campaigned hard for his top candidate, Silvia Lospennato. In recent appearances, he has criticized Milei for what he sees as a bellicose approach and disregard for traditional Argentine institutions.",
      "\u201cPutting the economy in order is not enough. We must strengthen institutions, be predictable and regain respect for one another,\u201d Macri told supporters.",
      "Just two years ago, Macri was key to Milei's landslide electoral victory. His center-right supplied Milei's new government with key ministers, brought him a conservative base and helped him secure the support of critical political brokers to help pass his radical agenda through an otherwise hostile Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Morocco is expanding its efforts to humanely manage the millions of stray dogs that roam the country's streets",
      "EL AARJATE, Morocco -- A mutt with a blue tag clipped to her ear whimpers as she\u2019s lifted from a cage and carried to a surgery table for a spay and a rabies vaccine, two critical steps before she\u2019s released back onto the streets of Morocco\u2019s capital.",
      "The \u201cBeldi,\u201d as Moroccan street dogs are called, is among the hundreds taken from Rabat to a dog pound in a nearby forest. As part of an expanded \u201cTrap, Neuter, Vaccinate and Return\u201d program, dogs like her are examined, treated and ultimately released with tags that make clear they pose no danger.",
      "\u201cWe have a problem: That\u2019s stray dogs. So we have to solve it, but in a way that respects animals,\u201d said Mohamed Roudani, the director of the Public Health and Green Spaces Department in Morocco's Interior Ministry.",
      "Morocco adopted \u201cTrap, Neuter, Vaccinate and Return,\u201d or TVNR, in 2019. One facility has opened in Rabat and more are set to be launched in at least 14 other cities, aligning Morocco with recommendations from the World Organization for Animal Health. The government has spent roughly $23 million over the past five years on animal control centers and programs.",
      "Roudani said Morocco\u2019s updated approach balanced public safety, health and animal well-being. Local officials, he added, were eager to expand TVNR centers throughout the country.",
      "Though population estimates are challenging, based on samples of marked and tagged stray dogs, Moroccan officials believe they number between 1.2 to 1.5 million. Some neighborhoods welcome and care for them collectively. However, others decry their presence as a scourge and note that more than 100,000 Moroccans have needed rabies vaccinations after attacks.",
      "A draft law is in the works that would require owners to vaccinate pets and impose penalties for animal abuse.",
      "On a visit organized for journalists to a TNVR center in El Aarjate, enclosures for dogs appear spacious and orderly, with clean floors and the scent of disinfectant. Food and water bowls are refreshed regularly by staff who move between spaces, offering gentle words and careful handling. Some staff members say they grow so attached to the dogs that they miss them when they\u2019re released to make space to treat incoming strays.",
      "Veterinarians and doctors working for the Association for the Protection of Animals and Nature care for between 400 and 500 stray dogs from Rabat and surrounding cities. Dogs that veterinarians deem unhealthy or aggressive are euthanized using sodium pentobarbital, while the rest are released, unable to spread disease or reproduce.",
      "Youssef Lhor, a doctor and veterinarian, said that aggressive methods to cull dogs didn't effectively make communities safer from rabies or aggression. He said it made more sense to to try to have people coexist with dogs safely, noting that more than 200 had been released after treatment from the Rabat-area center.",
      "\u201cSlaughtering dogs leads to nothing. This TNVR strategy is not a miracle solution, but it is an element that will add to everything else we're doing,\u201d he said, referring to \u201cTreat, Neuter, Vaccinate, Return.\u201d",
      "It's designed to gradually reduce the stray dog population while minimizing the need for euthanasia.",
      "It\u2019s a program that Morocco is eager to showcase after animal rights groups accused it of ramping up efforts to cull street dogs after being named co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup last year.",
      "Animal rights groups routinely use large sporting events to draw attention to their cause and similarly targeted Russia in the lead-up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup there.",
      "Citing unnamed sources and videos it said were shot in Morocco, the International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition claimed in January that Morocco was exterminating 3 million dogs, particularly around cities where stadiums are being built. The allegations, reported widely by international media lacking a presence in Morocco, triggered anti-FIFA protests as far away as Ahmedabad, India.",
      "\u201cThese dogs are being shot in the street, often in front of children, or dragged away with wire nooses to die slow, agonizing deaths,\u201d Ian Ward, the coalition\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.",
      "Moroccan officials vehemently deny the claims, say they\u2019re implementing the very programs that activists propose, including TNVR. They rebuff the idea that any policy is related to the World Cup. Still, critics see their efforts as publicity stunts and are skeptical such programs are as widespread as officials claim.",
      "Instances of mistreatment and euthanasia by gunshot have been reported in local media but Moroccan officials say, despite international attention, they\u2019re isolated incidents and don\u2019t reflect on-the-ground reality nationwide.",

      "RUBAYA, Congo -- Nestled in the green hills of Masisi territory in Congo, the artisanal Rubaya mining site hums with the sound of generators, as hundreds of men labor by hand to extract coltan, a key mineral crucial for producing modern electronics and defense technology \u2014 and fiercely sought after worldwide.",
      "Rubaya lies in the heart of eastern Congo, a mineral-rich part of the Central African nation which for decades has been ripped apart by violence from government forces and different armed groups, including the Rwanda-backed M23, whose recent resurgence has escalated the conflict, worsening an already acute humanitarian crisis.",
      "As the U.S. spearheads peace talks between Congo and Rwanda, Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi has sought out a deal with the Trump administration, offering mineral access in return for American support in quelling the insurgency and boosting security.",
      "While details of the deal remain unclear, analysts said Rubaya might be one of the mining sites which fall under its scope.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in and out of crisis for decades. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "The Rubaya mines have been at the center of the fighting, changing hands between the Congolese government and rebel groups. For over a year now, it has been controlled by the M23 rebels, who earlier this year advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma and Bukavu in a major escalation of the conflict.",
      "Despite the country's exceptional mineral wealth, over 70% of Congolese live on less than $2.15 a day.",
      "For the men working in the Rubaya\u2019s mines, who rely on the mining for their livelihoods, little has changed over decades of violence.",
      "One of them is Jean Baptiste Bigirimana, who has worked in the mines for seven years.",
      "\u201cI earn $40 a month, but that\u2019s not enough,\" he said. \"Children need clothes, education and food. When I divide up the money to see how I will take care of my children, I realize it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he said, adding that he doesn\u2019t know where the minerals he mines go once they leave Rubaya.",
      "The mines produce coltan \u2014 short for columbite-tantalite \u2014 an ore from which the metals tantalum and niobium are extracted. Both are considered critical raw materials by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan. Tantalum is used in mobile phones, computers and automotive electronics, as well as in aircraft engines, missile components and GPS systems. Niobium is used in pipelines, rockets and jet engines.",
      "Congo produced about 40% of the world\u2019s coltan in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, with Australia, Canada and Brazil being other major suppliers.",
      "The National Energy Emergency executive order, issued by Trump, highlighted the significance of critical minerals \u2014 including tantalum and niobium \u2014 and called for securing U.S. access to ensure both \"modern life and military preparedness.\u201d",
      "According to a U.N. report, since seizing Rubaya in April last year, the M23 has imposed taxes on the monthly trade and transport of 120 tonnes of coltan, generating at least $800,000 a month. The coltan then is exported to Rwanda, U.N. experts said. But even before M23 seized control of the mine, analysts said that the mineral was sold to Rwanda, the only difference being it was done through Congolese intermediaries.",
      "Experts say that it is not easy to trace how coltan arrives in Western countries.",
      "\u201cThe global coltan supply chain is pretty murky,\u201d said Guillaume de Brier, a natural resources researcher at the Antwerp-based International Peace Information Service. \u201cFrom eastern DRC, coltan is bought by traders, mostly Lebanese or Chinese, who will sell it to exporters based in Rwanda. Exporters will then ship it to the UAE or China, where it will be refined into tantalum and niobium, and sold to Western countries as metals from UAE or China.\u201d",
      "The M23 has previously controlled Rubaya for periods of time, and the U.N. asserted that, even before the takeover of Goma, the group was facilitating the smuggling of these minerals to Rwanda. Since M23 took control of the mine, Rwanda\u2019s official coltan exports have doubled, according to Rwandan official figures.",
      "At times the mines were also under control of the Wazalendo, a militia allied with the Congolese army.",
      "Alexis Twagira said he feels some things have improved under M23. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in this mine for 13 years, and I\u2019ve worked under the Wazalendo. When they were here, they would harass us, sometimes taking our minerals and demanding money,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N. has accused both the Congolese army and the M23 rebels of human rights abuses.",
      "Congo is the world\u2019s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and other products, but U.S. access is complicated by the fact that Chinese companies control 80% of its Congolese production. Congo also produces gold.",
      "In recent weeks, two U.S. companies opened doors to production in the region. Nathan Trotter, a U.S. firm, signed a letter of intent with Rwanda-based Trinity Metals, which owns Rwanda's largest tin mine. And KoBold Metals, which uses Artificial Intelligence to further energy transition and is backed by billionaire Bill Gates, brokered a deal to buy Australia\u2019s AVZ Minerals\u2019 interest in Congo's Manono lithium deposits.",
      "Analysts warn that the implementation of a minerals deal in eastern Congo, if one was to materialize, will face many hurdles \u2014 especially with U.S. investors largely abandoning Congo in the last two decades.",
      "\u201cTurning a headline announcement into sustainable progress will require resolving deep suspicions between Rwanda and the DRC,\u201d Chatham House, a research institute, said in a recent report. \u201cA deal will also need to account for complex local political problems of land access and identity, wider security challenges in a region that hosts myriad non-state armed groups, and issues of asset scarcity.\u201d",
      "If the deal were to include Rubaya, where all mining is currently done manually, U.S. companies would have to contend with both security concerns and a severe lack of infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWith coltan, you\u2019re dealing with hundreds of thousands of miners, and not just M23, but other so-called auto-defense armed groups and individuals who rely on mining for survival,\" said de Brier from the International Peace Information Service. \"You have to build all the infrastructure, you have to start from scratch. You will even have to build the roads.\u201d",
      "Bahati Mo\u00efse, a trader who resells coltan from Rubaya\u2019s mines, hopes that, regardless who controls the mines, the workers who labor to extract the minerals will finally be valued as much as the resources themselves.",
      "\u201cThe whole country, the whole world knows that phones are made from the coltan mined here, but look at the life we \u200b\u200blive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue like this.\u201d",

      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV \u2019s inauguration Mass on Sunday morning in St. Peter\u2019s Square and Basilica is a ritual filled with symbolism that connects back to Peter, Jesus\u2019 apostle, and his special mission as head of the Catholic Church.",
      "No new role is conferred \u2014 the pontiff is already the head of the Vatican and of the faith counting some 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide, tens of thousands of whom are expected to gather in the square alongside government representatives.",
      "But Leo will receive two crucial signs of his pontificate, the \u201cpallium\u201d and the fisherman\u2019s ring, marking his role as successor of Peter.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about them and more rituals in the solemn liturgy replete with ancient languages and Scriptural references \u2013 all after Leo takes a spin around the square in the popemobile.",
      "In most parts, it\u2019s a celebration of the Eucharist just like any Sunday Mass held in Catholic churches around the world.",
      "There will be prayers, music, readings from the New Testament, a homily and Communion, all in the usual order. Symbolism is interwoven even in some of the typical aspects, though.",
      "The Gospel passage, for instance, will focus on Jesus giving Peter responsibility as the shepherd of the church \u2014 a reference Leo made in his first public words the day he was elected.",
      "It will be proclaimed first in Latin and then in Greek. As the main languages of the nascent church 2,000 years ago, today they signify \u201cthe church\u2019s attempt to reach everyone\u201d and be universal, said the Rev. Giuseppe Midili, a professor and consultant with the Vatican's liturgy office.",
      "In a more personal touch, the Vatican says that by the outdoor altar there will be an image of the Mother of Good Counsel \u2014 an icon of Mary from a sanctuary in a small village outside Rome served by Augustinians, Leo\u2019s religious order.",
      "Two of the most significant moments will be right before the homily, when cardinals will give Leo the pallium and his fisherman\u2019s ring.",
      "The pallium is a narrow stole-like vestment with two pendants to be worn across the shoulders, decorated with crosses representing Jesus\u2019 wounds. It\u2019s made of white wool in an elaborate procedure where the lambs traditionally were blessed before being sheared, just like for the similar vestments given to archbishops on their ordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the symbolism of the good shepherd who carries the sheep on his shoulders,\u201d Midili said.",
      "\u201cPastor\u201d means shepherd in Latin and Scriptures often refer to the good shepherd who gives his life for his flock, a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus, and of Peter, who was martyred. Leo will receive it from Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, who told the world the new pope\u2019s name on May 8.",
      "The fisherman\u2019s ring recalls the Gospel passage where Jesus appeared to the apostles after his resurrection as they had spent a night fishing with no catch. He told Peter to cast in a specific spot\u2014 and the nets strained with lots of large fish, some of which the apostles then shared with Jesus in a lakeside breakfast.",
      "An image of Peter with the net, standing for the church\u2019s evangelization mission and its unity, is engraved on the ring alongside the pope\u2019s name. When a pope dies, the ring is crossed over so it can no longer be used as seal for papal documents. Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines, who was widely regarded as a papal contender, will present Leo with the ring.",
      "At the beginning of the celebration, both ring and pallium are taken from the chapel of St. Peter\u2019s tomb, underneath the Basilica \u2014 where the pope prays accompanied by the patriarchs of eastern rite Catholic churches \u2014 out to the altar set up in St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "Just after the giving of those two insignia, a delegation representing different roles in the church, from cardinals to the faithful, including a married couple, will greet Leo in the \u201crite of obedience\u201d that symbolizes the church turning to the new pontiff to follow his guidance.",
      "After Mass, Leo will greet the government representatives, royalty and religious delegations.",
      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, both Catholics representing an administration that often sparred with Pope Francis, are scheduled to attend Mass for the first U.S. pope.",
      "Also expected at Mass, according to the Vatican, are more than 20 heads of state including Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, and Premier Giorgia Meloni, as well as Dina Boluarte, the president of Peru, where Leo has citizenship and spent many years as missionary and bishop.",

      "LISBON, Portugal -- Voters in Portugal return to the polls Sunday for a third general election in three years, as the country\u2019s increasingly fragmented political landscape defies efforts to unite behind policies on pressing national issues such as immigration, housing and the cost of living.",
      "Hopes that the ballot might end the worst spell of political instability in decades for the European Union country of 10.6 million people could be dashed, however. Polls suggest the election is poised to deliver yet another minority government, leaving the Portuguese back where they started.",
      "\u201cWhat the polls indicate is that there will not be major differences from the last election results,\u201d says Marina Costa Lobo, head researcher at Lisbon University\u2019s Institute of Social Sciences. That outcome could bring another scramble to build political alliances in Parliament, she said.",
      "For the past 50 years two parties have dominated politics in Portugal, with the center-right Social Democrats and the center-left Socialist Party alternating in power. They are likely to come out on top in this ballot, too.",
      "But public frustration with their record in government has fueled the growth of new alternatives in recent years. That has denied the bigger parties enough seats in Parliament to snare a majority needed to ensure they serve a full four-year term.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know who to go for,\u201d said 47-year-old Lisbon resident Patricia Fortes. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with the main parties, but then I feel I don\u2019t know the other parties well enough.\u201d",
      "A center-right minority government headed by the Social Democrats in partnership with the smaller Popular Party lost a confidence vote in parliament in March after less than a year in power, as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an early election, which had been due only in 2028.",
      "Polls have suggested that the partnership, called Democratic Alliance, again has a small lead over the Socialists but likely not enough to secure 116 seats in the 230-seat National Assembly, Portugal\u2019s parliament.",
      "Voting begins at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and ends at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT), when exit polls can be published. Most official results are expected by midnight (2300 GMT).",
      "The confidence vote was triggered by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Social Democrat Prime Minister Luis Montenegro\u2019s family law firm. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing and is standing for reelection.",
      "Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years. That has helped fuel the rise of Chega (Enough), a hard-right populist party whose leader Andre Ventura says he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for misconduct in office.",
      "But Chega, which shot from 12 to 50 seats to come third in last year\u2019s election, has recently fallen foul of its own lawmakers\u2019 alleged wrongdoing.",

      "Romanians are casting their ballots in a tense presidential runoff between a hard-right nationalist and a pro-Western centrist",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanians are casting ballots Sunday in a tense presidential runoff between a hard-right nationalist and a pro-Western centrist in a high-stakes election rerun that could determine the geopolitical direction of the European Union and NATO member country.",
      "Sunday\u2019s race pits front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It comes months after the cancelation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.",
      "Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) local time and will close at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday at polling stations set up in other countries, and more than 730,000 have already cast ballots.",
      "Romania\u2019s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied.",
      "Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania\u2019s old political class.",
      "Most recent local surveys indicate the runoff will be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects.",
      "Turnout is typically higher in the final round of Romanian presidential elections, and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome on Sunday. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 9.5 million, or 53% of eligible voters, according to official electoral data.",
      "Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016 but later left, and is running independently on a pro-EU ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform.",
      "The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday's race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition\u2019s candidate to advance to the runoff.",
      "After coming fourth in last year\u2019s canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu who was banned in March from standing in the redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right.",
      "Simion, also a former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape, reducing bureaucracy and taxes. But he insists that his main goal is to restore democracy. \u201cMy platform is to return to democracy, to the will of the people,\u201d he said.",
      "The AUR party he leads says it stands for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom\u201d and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature.",
      "To his critics, Simion is a pro-Russian extremist who threatens Romania\u2019s longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO. But in an Associated Press interview, he rejected the accusations, saying Russia is his country\u2019s biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as \u201cequal partners\u201d in Brussels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don\u2019t think that he\u2019s an anti-Russian candidate,\u201d said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. \u201cI think what is driving him is \u2026 his focus on what I call identity politics.\u201d",
      "In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania\u2019s large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad in search of better opportunities.",
      "Hours after voting opened Friday, Simion accused the Moldovan government of election fraud, claims that were quickly rejected by Moldovan and Romanian authorities. \u201cThese statements are intended to sow distrust and hostility, with the aim of influencing the election process,\u201d Romania\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",

      "About 150 official delegations are expected at the formal installation Mass for Pope Leo XIV",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV is officially opening his pontificate in a ceremony Sunday that blends ancient ritual, evocative symbols and a nod to modern-day celebrity, all in front of the presidents, princes and tens of thousands of people expected to pack St. Peter\u2019s Square to celebrate history\u2019s first American pope.",
      "Leo will start the day by taking his first tour through the piazza in the popemobile. The open-topped vehicle has become synonymous with the papacy\u2019s global reach and mediatic draw, used at home and abroad to bring popes close to their flock.",
      "It was here that Pope Francis took his last popemobile ride on Easter Sunday, and it was on the back of a modified popemobile that Francis\u2019 casket was brought across Rome last month to its final resting place.",
      "Leo, the 69-year-old Chicago-born Augustinian missionary, seems a bit more timid than Francis. But all eyes will be on how he manages the throngs of pilgrims, tourists and curiosity-seekers, and the babies who will inevitably be passed up to him for him to bless.",
      "After the festive public tour in the square, Leo goes into the basilica to begin the solemn ceremony to inaugurate his ministry in a series of rites that emphasize the service that he's called to offer to lead the Catholic Church. He prays first at the tomb of St. Peter, considered to be the first pope, under the basilica\u2019s main altar and then processes out to St. Peter\u2019s Square for the Mass.",
      "Strict diplomatic protocol dictates the seating arrangements, with both the United States and Peru getting front-row seats thanks to Leo\u2019s dual citizenship. U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert who tangled with Francis over the Trump administration\u2019s mass migrant deportation plans, is leading the American delegation along with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Peruvian President Dina Boluarte is one of around a dozen heads of state attending, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "During the Mass, Leo will receive the two potent symbols of the papacy: the lambswool stole, known as a pallium, and the fisherman\u2019s ring. The pallium, draped across his shoulders, symbolizes the pastor carrying his flock as the pope carries the faithful. The ring, which becomes Leo\u2019s official seal, harks back to Jesus\u2019 call to the apostle Peter to cast his fishing nets.",
      "The other symbolically important moment of the Mass is the representational rite of obedience to Leo: Whereas in the past all cardinals would vow obedience to the new pope, more recent papal installations involve representatives of cardinals, bishops, priests, deacons, nuns, married couples and young people participating in the rite.",
      "In the days since his historic election, Leo has already sketched out some of his key priorities as pope, emphasizing a message of peace, so it's not known if he'll use his installation homily as a mission statement as some of his predecessors did.",
      "In his Oct. 22, 1978 installation homily, St. John Paul II uttered a phrase that became something of a refrain of his pontificate and the ones that followed: \u201cBe not afraid! Open wide the doors to Christ!\u201d",
      "Pope Benedict XVI quoted his predecessor during his installation homily, on April 25, 2005, and offered a meditation on the symbols of church unity represented by the pallium and fisherman\u2019s ring. Francis\u2019 installation homily, on March 19, 2013, focused on the need to protect the environment, an early hint of what would become one of the priorities of his pontificate.",
      "Leo has vowed all efforts to find peaceful ends to the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere. But as a priority, he has also identified the challenges to humanity posed by artificial intelligence, making the parallel to the challenges to human dignity posed by the industrial revolution that were confronted by his namesake, Pope Leo XIII, who was pope from 1878-1903.",
      "After the homily and at the end of the Mass, Leo will offer a final blessing and then go into the basilica to greet the heads of the more than 150 official delegations attending.",
      "Security is expected to be tight, as it was for Francis\u2019 funeral on April 26, which drew an estimated 250,000 people. Rome authorities are planning for another 250,000 on Sunday. The piazza and main boulevard leading to it, and two nearby piazzas have been set up with giant television screens, and dozens of portable toilets have been erected in a nearby park.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that the Vatican can be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "ROME -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks, taking up the Holy See\u2019s longstanding offer after Pope Leo XIV vowed to personally make \u201cevery effort\u201d to help end the war.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Rome before meeting with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican point man on Ukraine, Rubio said that he would be discussing potential ways the Vatican could help, \u201cthe status of the talks, the updates after yesterday (Friday) and the path forward.\u201d",
      "Asked if the Vatican could be a peace broker, Rubio replied: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it broker, but it\u2019s certainly \u2014 I think it\u2019s a place that both sides would be comfortable going.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019ll talk about all of that and obviously always grateful to the Vatican for their willingness to play this constructive and positive role,\u201d said Rubio, who also met Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state and foreign minister.",
      "The Vatican has a tradition of diplomatic neutrality and had long offered its services, and venues, to try to help facilitate talks, but found itself sidelined during the all-out war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Pope Francis, who occasionally angered both Kyiv and Moscow with his off-the-cuff comments, had entrusted Zuppi with a mandate to try to find paths of peace. But the mandate seemed to narrow to help facilitate the return of Ukrainian children taken by Russia, and the Holy See also was able to mediate some prisoner exchanges.",
      "During their meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, Rubio thanked Zuppi for the Vatican's humanitarian role, citing in particular prisoner swaps and the return of Ukrainian children. Rubio \u201cemphasized the importance of continued collaboration under the new leadership of Pope Leo XIV,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "Leo, who was elected history\u2019s first American pope on May 8, took up Francis\u2019 call for peace in Ukraine in his first Sunday noon blessing as pope. He appealed for all sides to do whatever possible to reach \u201can authentic, just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Leo, who as a bishop in Peru had called Russia's war an \u201cimperialist invasion,\" vowed this week personally to \u201cmake every effort so that this peace may prevail.\u201d",
      "In a speech to eastern rite Catholics, including the Greek Catholic Church of Ukraine, Leo begged warring sides to meet and negotiate.",
      "\u201cThe Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face to face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, repeated the Vatican\u2019s offer to serve as a venue for direct talks, saying the failure of negotiations in Istanbul to reach a ceasefire this week was \u201ctragic.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had hoped it could start a process, slow but positive, toward a peaceful solution to the conflict,\u201d Parolin said on the sidelines of a conference. \u201cBut instead we\u2019re back to the beginning.\u201d",
      "Asked concretely what such an offer would entail, Parolin said that the Vatican could serve as a venue for a direct meeting between the two sides.",
      "\u201cOne would aim to arrive at this, that at least they talk. We\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s an offer of a place,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have always said, repeated to the two sides that we are available to you, with all the discretion needed,\u201d Parolin said.",
      "The Vatican scored what was perhaps its greatest diplomatic achievement of the Francis pontificate when it facilitated the talks between the United States and Cuba in 2014 that resulted in the resumption of diplomatic relations.",
      "The Holy See has also often hosted far less secret diplomatic initiatives, such as when it brought together the rival leaders of South Sudan in 2019. The encounter was made famous by the image of Francis bending down to kiss their feet to beg them to make peace.",
      "Perhaps the Holy See's most critical diplomatic initiative came during the peak of the Cuban missile crisis when, in the fall of 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered a secret deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba that were soon detected by U.S. spy planes.",
      "As the Kennedy administration considered its response, with the threat of nuclear war looming, Pope John XXIII pleaded for peace in a public radio address, in a speech to Vatican ambassadors and also wrote privately to Kennedy and Khruschev, appealing to their love of their people to stand down.",
      "Many historians have credited John XXIII\u2019s appeals with helping both sides step back from the brink of nuclear war.",

      "The locomotive engineers' strike began Friday at the rail system with 350,000 daily riders and left commuters either working from home or searching for other ways to travel across the state or over the Hudson River to New York City.",
      "Kolluri spoke Saturday at Newark's Broad Street Station, saying the agency is preparing for the workweek commute by \u201csurging\u201d buses to help commuters at train stations. But he cautioned that the buses can't handle the entire volume of the commuter rail system.",
      "Kolluri said he and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen President Mark Wallace spoke and agreed to meet Saturday. It had been uncertain whether the two sides would meet ahead of a National Mediation Board meeting already set for Sunday.",

      "Wallace walked the picket line Friday outside New York City\u2019s Penn Station, and said the engineers are committed to staying on strike until they get a fair deal. Union members were nearly unanimous in authorizing a strike last summer, and 87% of them rejected the latest agreement.",
      "Wallace said NJ Transit needs to pay engineers a wage that\u2019s comparable to Amtrak and Long Island Railroad because engineers are leaving for jobs on those other railroads for better pay,",
      "The union has seen steady attrition in its ranks at NJ Transit as more members leave to take better-paying jobs at other railroads. The number of NJ Transit engineers has shrunk from 500 several months ago to about 400. The engineers are responsible for operating trains, ensuring safe and smooth transport between stations,",

      "NJ Transit is the nation\u2019s third-largest transit system and operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. The walkout halts all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other, as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",

      "Moody's is the last of the three major rating agencies to lower the federal government's credit. Standard & Poor's downgraded federal debt in 2011 and Fitch Ratings followed in 2023.",
      "In a statement, Moody's said: \"We expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of (the U.S. economy) by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "Extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, a priority of the Republican-controlled Congress, Moody's said, would add $4 trillion over the next decade to the federal primary deficit (which does not include interest payments).",
      "A gridlocked political system has been unable to tackle America's huge deficits. Republicans reject tax increases, and Democrats are reluctant to cut spending.",
      "On Friday, House Republicans failed to push a big package of tax breaks and spending cuts through the Budget Committee. A small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers, insisting on steeper cuts to Medicaid and President Joe Biden\u2019s green energy tax breaks, joined all Democrats in opposing it.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials on Friday endorsed the first blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s and identify patients who may benefit from drugs that can modestly slow the memory-destroying disease.",
      "The test can aid doctors in determining whether a patient\u2019s memory problems are due to Alzheimer\u2019s or a number of other medical conditions that can cause cognitive difficulties. The Food and Drug Administration cleared it for patients 55 and older who are showing early signs of the disease.",
      "More than 6 million people in the United States and millions more around the world have Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia.",
      "The new test, from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., identifies a sticky brain plaque, known as beta-amyloid, that is a key marker for Alzheimer\u2019s. Previously, the only FDA-approved methods for detecting amyloid were invasive tests of spinal fluid or expensive PET scans.",
      "The lower costs and convenience of a blood test could also help expand use of two new drugs, Leqembi and Kisunla, which have been shown to slightly slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing amyloid from the brain. Doctors are required to test patients for the plaque before prescribing the drugs, which require regular IV infusions.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer\u2019s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Tarver, of FDA\u2019s center for devices.",
      "A number of specialty hospitals and laboratories have already developed their own in-house tests for amyloid in recent years. But those tests aren\u2019t reviewed by the FDA and generally aren\u2019t covered by insurance. Doctors have also had little data to judge which tests are reliable and accurate, leading to an unregulated marketplace that some have called a \u201cwild west.\u201d",
      "Several larger diagnostic and drug companies are also developing their own tests for FDA approval, including Roche, Eli Lilly and C2N Diagnostics.",
      "The tests can only be ordered by a doctor and aren\u2019t intended for people who don\u2019t yet have any symptoms.",

      "A federal judge in Texas struck down guidance from a government agency specifying protections against workplace harassment based on gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Thursday determined that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission exceeded its statutory authority when the agency issued guidance to employers against deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, and barring employees from wearing dress code-compliant clothing according to their gender identity because they may constitute forms of workplace harassment.",
      "Kacsmaryk said the guidance is \u201cinconsistent with the text, history, and tradition of Title VII and recent Supreme Court precedent.\u201d",
      "Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.",
      "The EEOC, which enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, had updated its guidance on workplace harassment in April of last year under President Joe Biden for the first time in 25 years. It followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Texas and the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, in August challenged the guidance, which the agency says serves as a tool for employers to assess compliance with anti-discrimination laws and is not legally binding. Kacsmaryk disagreed, writing that the guidance creates \u201cmandatory standards ... from which legal consequences will necessarily flow if an employer fails to comply.\u201d",
      "The decision marks the latest blow to workplace protections for transgender workers following President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Kacsmaryk, a 2017 Trump nominee, invalidated all portions of the EEOC guidance that defines \u201csex\u201d to include \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity,\u201d along with an entire section addressing the subject.",
      "\u201cTitle VII does not require employers or courts to blind themselves to the biological differences between men and women,\u201d he wrote in the opinion.",
      "Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts commended the decision in an emailed statement: \u201cThe Biden EEOC tried to compel businesses \u2014 and the American people \u2014 to deny basic biological truth. Today, thanks to the great state of Texas and the work of my Heritage colleagues, a federal judge said: not so fast.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis ruling is more than a legal victory. It\u2019s a cultural one. It says no \u2014 you don\u2019t have to surrender common sense at the altar of leftist ideology. You don\u2019t have to pretend men are women. And you don\u2019t have to lie to keep your job. \u201d",
      "The National Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed an amicus brief in November in support of the harassment guidance, blasted the decision in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision is an outrage and blatantly at odds with Supreme Court precedent,\u201d said Liz Theran, senior director of litigation for education and workplace justice at NWLC. \u201cThe EEOC\u2019s Harassment Guidance reminds employers and workers alike to do one simple thing that should cost no one anything: refrain from degrading others on the job based on their identity and who they love. This decision does not change the law, but it will make it harder for LGBTQIA+ workers to enforce their rights and experience a workplace free from harassment.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice and the EEOC declined to comment on the outcome of the case.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "An organization that honored The Associated Press' Nick Ut with its \u201c photo of the year \u201d in 1973 for a picture of a girl running from a napalm attack in the Vietnam War says it has \u201csuspended its attribution\u201d to Ut because of doubts over who actually took it.",
      "World Press Photo's report Friday adds to the muddle over an issue that has split the photographic community since a movie earlier this year, \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d questioned Ut's authorship. The photo of a naked and terrified Kim Phuc became an iconic symbol of the war's tragedy.",
      "After two investigations, The Associated Press said it found no definitive evidence to warrant stripping Ut's photo credit. The AP said it was possible Ut took the picture, but the passage of time made it impossible to fully prove, and could find no evidence to prove anyone else did.",
      "World Press Photo said its probe found that two other photographers \u2014 Nguyen Thanh Nghe, the man mentioned in \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d and Huynh Cong Phuc \u2014 \u201cmay have been better positioned\u201d to take the shot.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution,\u201d said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. \u201cAt the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship, either.\u201d",
      "World Press Photo, an organization whose awards are considered influential in photography, won't attempt to recover the cash award given to Ut, a spokeswoman said.",
      "Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, said his client hadn't spoken to World Press Photo after some initial contact before \u201cThe Stringer\u201d was released. \u201cIt seems they had already made up their mind to punish Nick Ut from the start,\u201d he said.",
      "Gary Knight, a producer of \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is a four-time judge of the World Press Photo awards and a consultant to the World Press Photo Foundation.",
      "The AP said Friday that its standards \u201crequire proof and certainty to remove a credit and we have found that it is impossible to prove exactly what happened that day on the road or in the (AP) bureau over 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand World Press Photo has taken different action based on the same available information, and that is their prerogative,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no question over AP's ownership of the photo.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize that Ut won for the photo appears safe. The Pulitzers depend on news agencies who enter the awards to determine authorship, and administrator Marjorie Miller \u2014 a former AP senior editor \u2014 pointed to the AP\u2019s study showing insufficient proof to withdraw credit. \u201cThe board does not anticipate future action at this time,\u201d she said Friday.",

      "NEW YORK -- Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans.",
      "Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.",
      "At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much confusion, they\u2019ve made it very complicated,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center.",
      "At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.",
      "If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions.",
      "Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.",
      "The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.",
      "Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10.",
      "Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.",
      "Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.",
      "Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.",
      "To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.",
      "\"We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,\" Abrams said.",
      "While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.",
      "The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.",
      "The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.",
      "It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.",
      "Nothing has changed yet.",
      "President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.",

      "\u201cThere could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,\u201d said Austin.",
      "An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments.",
      "Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.",
      "Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times.",
      "\u201cWe've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,\u201d said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.",
      "Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.",

      "The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.",
      "Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.",
      "Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.",

      "\u201cWe just had a meeting with President Zelensky and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today, and the Russian position is clearly unacceptable,\u201d Starmer told reporters.",
      "\u201cAs a result of that meeting with President Zelensky, under discussion with President Trump, we are now closely aligning and coordinating our responses and will continue to do so,\u201d he said, as European leaders held a summit in Albania.",
      "He said the decision with Trump was also agreed on with the leaders of France, Germany and Poland.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",

      "Russia and Ukraine were holding their first direct peace talks in three years, in the Turkish port city of Istanbul, but officials and observers expected them to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cUkraine is ready to take all realistic steps to end this war,\u201d Zelenskyy told leaders gathered for a summit of the European Political Community. But he warned: \u201cIf it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can\u2019t deliver any results today, the world must respond.\u201d",
      "That reaction, he said, should include \"sanctions against Russia\u2019s energy sector and banks.\u201d",

      "The last summit, hosted by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, an ardent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, was dominated by the concerns and opportunities that might arise in the wake of Trump's reelection.",

      "The summit comes after the governing Socialist Party of the host, Prime Minister Edi Rama, won Albania\u2019s May 11 parliamentary election, attracting voters who support the country\u2019s long and somewhat uphill effort to join the European Union. The vote secured a fourth term for Rama.",

      "BANGKOK -- A construction magnate, builders, designers and engineers surrendered to police Friday on criminal negligence charges for the deadly collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in the March 28 earthquake that hit Myanmar.",
      "Premchai Karnasuta, the president of Italian-Thai Development Co, the main Thai contractor for the building project, as well as designers and engineers were among 17 charged with the felony of professional negligence causing death, Bangkok deputy police chief Noppasin Poonsawat said.",
      "Noppasin said those who met police on Friday formally denied the charges. Several have previously issued public denials in response to allegations in the media.",
      "Ninety-two people were confirmed dead in the rubble of the building that had been under construction and a small number of other people remain unaccounted for. The building, which was to become a new State Audit Office, was the only one in Thailand to collapse in the earthquake that was centered in neighboring Myanmar. The search for victims at the site has been halted, though efforts to identify remains through DNA will continue.",
      "Noppasin said at a news conference that evidence and testimony from experts suggested the building plan did not meet standards and codes. The Bangkok Post newspaper said police had also determined the project showed \"structural flaws in the core lift shaft and substandard concrete and steel.\u201d",
      "Thai media have reported allegations of wrongdoing in the project almost every day since the building\u2019s collapse, many of them involving irregular documentation for the project. Their reports have highlighted the role of Italian-Thai\u2019s Chinese joint venture partner, the China Railway No. 10 company, which is involved in projects around the world.",
      "One of the 17 charged Friday was Chinese executive Zhang Chuanling, a director at China Railway No. 10\u2019s joint venture with Italian-Thai Development. He was previously arrested last month on a charge of violating Thai business law by wrongly using Thai nominees to serve as the Chinese firm\u2019s proxies to allegedly control the joint venture. Three Thai executives were also arrested on the charge.",
      "A Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for the 17 on the negligence charge on Thursday. Noppasin said 15 turned themselves in at a police station in the morning and the remaining two were expected to do so later Friday.",
      "The epicenter of the quake was in central Myanmar, where it killed more than 3,700 people and caused major damage in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city, and the capital Naypyitaw.",
      "Premchai\u2019s case is his second major tangle with the law. In 2019, he was convicted of wildlife poaching and served about three years in prison.",
      "He was found guilty of killing protected animals and illegal possession of weapons after park rangers found a hunting party at a wildlife sanctuary in 2018 with carcasses of a rare black panther, a kalij pheasant and a barking deer. The panther had been butchered and its meat cooked for soup.",

      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Musk and his companies haven\u2019t provided an explanation for Grok's responses, which were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, but on Thursday the absence of any explanation forced those outside the company to make their best guesses.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Graham's post brought what appeared to be a sarcastic response from Musk's rival, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.",
      "\u201cThere are many ways this could have happened. I\u2019m sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,\u201d wrote Altman, who has been sued by Musk in a dispute rooted in the founding of OpenAI.",
      "Some asked Grok itself to explain, but like other chatbots, it is prone to falsehoods known as hallucinations, making it hard to determine if it was making things up.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees Monday, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group as Trump suspends refugee programs and halts arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression and has now been decried by Musk and others as promoting the killing of whites. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck believes the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically very random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "The National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Thursday showing the number of airline and ship passengers who entered the country last month using business visas.",
      "The Middle East was the only region that saw higher business travel to the U.S., with arrivals up 9.4% compared to April 2024. But that didn't make up for big losses from other regions; the number of business travelers from Western Europe fell 17.7%, for example.",
      "The new government data didn't include people coming from Canada for business or who traveled by land from Mexico. Mexican arrivals by air for those holding business visas were down 11.8%, the government said.",
      "And overall travel from Canada also fell in April. According to Statistics Canada, Canadian residents' return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Business travel to the U.S. held up better than leisure travel in the first quarter of the year. According to U.S. government data, more than 1.2 million travelers entered the U.S. using business visas in the January-March period, up 7% from the year before. The number of travelers using tourist visas fell 6%.",
      "But that flipped in April, as the late Easter holiday likely encouraged more leisure travel. Travel to the U.S. by international travelers holding tourist visas was up 13.8% in April.",
      "It's unclear if that trend will hold. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said an analysis of online travel agency data indicated that advance bookings from Europe to 14 U.S. cities in June, July and August were down 12% from those same months last year.",
      "Multiple U.S. airlines have pulled their financial forecasts for the year, citing uncertainty and weaker demand from lower-fare leisure travelers. Many industry experts think business travel to the U.S. will continue to decline in the coming months.",
      "Leslie Andrews, the global travel leader for real estate company JLL and a board member at the Global Business Travel Association Foundation, said she thinks corporate travel to the U.S. will slow in the second and third quarters of the year as the full impact of economic and geopolitical volatility sets in.",
      "\u201cWhat I am hearing is, \u2018Things were good in the first quarter,\u2019 but in the second quarter it\u2019s a matter of, \u2018Must you take that trip?\u2019\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThey\u2019re pulling in the reins a bit to make sure only purposeful travel is happening as things grow and evolve.\u201d",

      "Haggarty, who owns a company that sells gifts and souvenirs, said Canadian retailers no longer want U.S.-made merchandise. His U.S. suppliers are struggling to stay afloat due to U.S. tariffs on products made in China. Above all, he\u2019s concerned about reports of international travelers being detained at the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cHonestly, my nervousness and reluctance to cross into the U.S. stems from that more than any hostility to the American market,\u201d said Haggarty, who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Global Business Travel Association CEO Suzanne Neufang said a poll of more than 900 of the association\u2019s members last month showed nearly one-third expected a decline in global travel volumes this year.",
      "Canadian members were the most pessimistic, with 71% saying they expect a decrease in travel this year, Neufang said.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty is unnerving for a business travel sector that likes to be safe and likes to be efficient,\u201d she said.",
      "A drop-off in business trips would represent a setback for the U.S. travel industry and cities that host international conventions and trade shows. The $1.6 trillion global business travel sector was finally returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. business travel spending reached pre-COVID levels in 2023, Neufang said, while the rest of the world achieved that last year.",
      "Brett Sterenson, the president of Hotel Lobbyists, a Washington firm that helps groups book hotels for meetings and conferences, said he was losing international business as some countries warn travelers not to visit the U.S.",
      "U.S. government cuts are also hurting business, Sterenson said. He works with several groups that offer international exchange programs through the State Department. The programs welcome travelers from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and elsewhere and share best practices on things like energy policy and environmental stewardship, he said. But with funding cuts, that part of his business is down 75%.",
      "\u201cThese exchanges were monumentally useful in spreading goodwill, but also in educating developing nations on good governance,\u201d Sterenson said.",
      "Haggarty, in Canada, said he canceled a trip to a trade show in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and said several retailers he works with also pulled out. He\u2019s now looking to England, France, Spain and other markets for goods to sell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s much easier to bring products to Canada from the U.S., but we\u2019re in a corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know just how much damage this administration is doing to their relationships globally.\u201d",

      "Reese had 12 points and 17 rebounds in the 93-58 loss to the Fever. The Sky forward and Clark had an incident on the court with 4:38 left in the third quarter. It started with Reese grabbing an offensive rebound and Clark slapping Reese\u2019s arm hard enough to jar the ball loose and knock Reese to floor.",
      "When Reese got up, she tried to confront Clark before Indiana center Aliyah Boston stepped in between the two players. Clark\u2019s third personal foul was upgraded to a flagrant 1 while Boston and Reese each drew technical fouls following a replay review by the referees.",
      "Both players downplayed the play after the game.",
      "The league launched \u201cNo Space for Hate\u201d this season, a multi-dimensional platform designed to combat hate and promote respect across all WNBA spaces both online and in-arena.",
      "The league is focused on four key areas: enhanced technological features to detect hateful comments online; increased emphasis on team, arena and league security measures; reinforcing mental health resources; and alignment of core against hate.",
      "This will be the league's first test of it.",
      "\u201cIt's nice in words, but we got to see actions,\u201d Aces star A'ja Wilson said Friday after practice. \u201cHopefully people can take actions and understand this is bigger than basketball. We're true people behind it. Any shoe that we wear, any jersey we have on, we're human. People have to respect that. I hope they pay attention and listen to the words.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",

      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years.

      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Responding to complaints from the tech industry and other countries, the U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded a Biden-era rule due to take effect Thursday that placed limits on the number of artificial intelligence chips that could be exported to certain international markets without federal approval.",
      "\u201cThese new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,\u201d the Commerce Department stated in its guidance.",
      "President Joe Biden established the export framework shortly before he left office in an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. While the United States had already restricted exports to adversaries such as China and Russia, some of those controls had loopholes and the rule would have set limits on a much broader group of countries, including Middle Eastern countries that President Donald Trump is visiting this week.",
      "The Biden rule's sorting more than 100 countries into different tiers of export restrictions drew strong opposition from those countries, as well as U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They argued the restrictions could actually push some countries to turn to China instead of the U.S. for their AI technology.",
      "What Biden's rule did \"was send a message to 120 nations that they couldn\u2019t necessarily count on us to provide the AI they want and need,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, at a U.S. Senate hearing last week.",
      "Commerce Undersecretary Jeffery Kessler said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration will work to replace the now-rescinded rule to pursue AI with \"trusted foreign countries around the world, while keeping the technology out of the hands of our adversaries.\" The administration said a replacement rule is coming in the future but hasn't said what the new rule will say.",
      "The European Commission welcomed the change, said spokesperson Thomas Regnier, arguing that the Biden rule, if it took effect, would \"undermine U.S. diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.\u201d",
      "European Union countries should be able to buy advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations, Regnier said.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "Delegations from Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey on Thursday for the first direct talks related to ending the war Russia started in February 2022 when it launched a full-scale invasion of its sovereign neighbor.

And I think Monday will go a long way towards identifying where we are and how we complete this negotiation.\"",

He has directly sent letters to the supreme leader. I have been dispatched to deliver that message as well, and I've delivered it. ...",
      "We have one very, very clear red line, and that is enrichment. We cannot allow even 1 percent of an enrichment capability. We've delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them. ... But everything begins for our -- from our standpoint, Jon, with a -- a deal that does not include enrichment. We cannot have that. Because enrichment enables weaponization. And we will not allow a bomb to -- to get here.",
      "But, short of that, there are all kinds of ways for us to achieve our goals in this negotiation. We think that we will be meeting sometime this week in Europe. And we hope that it will lead to some real positivity.",

      "Karl: Are you pushing the Israelis to allow that aid to come in and -- and to hold back on some of the -- the offensive operations that continue to be ongoing in Gaza?",
      "Witkoff: The president, Jon, is a humanitarian. And I think that any -- everyone is concerned about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza. That said, it is a very complicated situation there. Logistically, we are -- I don't think there's any daylight between President Trump's position and Prime Minister Netanyahu's position. The issue now is -- I think the issue now is, how do we logistically get all of those trucks into Gaza? How do we set up the aid stations? There are many things -- initiatives that we are working on to address this. There -- there are going to be mobile kitchens that are going to be sent in there. The flour -- we have trucks with flour waiting at the border. The Israelis have indicated that they're going to begin to allow a lot more of these trucks to get in. But it is complicated. It is logistically complicated.",

      "Witkof: It's a perfectly legal, government to government, Department of Defense, to Department of Defense transaction that happens in the normal course and has been happening in the normal course throughout -- throughout our existence. Governments exchange services. ... They (the Qataris) decided to donate something because of all the wonderful things that we've done for them in the past, and in addition to that, they then, on top of that, announced $1.2 trillion worth of investments into the United States of America, which will create jobs and do all kinds of wonderful things.",
      "So, I don't really -- I'm not sure how anyone would see this as the Qataris looking to gain some sort of advantage. ... I just want to say, this is to the benefit of the United States of America that -- that donation. So, it -- it just has to be seen as that way.",

    "story": [
      "Follow-through has been one issue for Trump in the past, one expert said.",
      "President Donald Trump wrapped up a four-day Middle East trip on Friday, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "His first major foreign trip of his second term saw the U.S. secure more than $2 trillion in investment agreements in the Gulf region, according to the White House, as well as Trump announcing that he will move to lift U.S. sanctions in Syria.",
      "Trump also said during the trip that he believed that the U.S. and Tehran are \"getting close to maybe doing a deal\" on Iran's nuclear program and called on Qatar to use its influence to persuade Iran's leadership to reach an agreement with the U.S. to dial back its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The trip \"creates some pretty interesting openings and opportunities,\" Michael Hanna, the U.S. program director for the International Crisis Group, told ABC News.",
      "\"It looks like maybe the region, led by the Gulf, can have some really substantive, important input in shaping U.S. policy in a better direction,\" he said, such as moving away from military conflict with Iran and the Houthis and engaging with Syria to stabilize the transition after the Assad family was removed from power.",
      "But, he said, \"one of the things that has been a huge problem for Trump, traditionally, is implementation and follow-through.\"",
      "During Trump's trip, the U.S. secured over $200 billion in commercial deals with the United Arab Emirates, more than $243.5 billion in economic deals and a $1.2 trillion economic exchange agreement with Qatar, and a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S., the White House said. Some of the deals focused on AI infrastructure, energy and defense.",
      "\"Increasingly, he's convinced, as a former real estate developer and businessman, that pushing for expansion of America's business interest should be the primary business of American government, so to speak. And he went there with that mission,\" Manochehr Dorraj, a political science professor at Texas Christian University, told ABC News. \"So far as that was a guiding principle, he took major strides toward achieving that goal.\"",
      "But, he noted, \"the devil is always in the details.\"",
      "\"We'll see how that would pan out in practice,\" Dorraj said.",
      "Among his major announcements, Trump said during a keynote speech in Riyadh on Tuesday that he will order the cessation of U.S. sanctions against Syria, which has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, \"in order to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "Following that announcement, there are \"a lot of big question marks\" in terms of implementation and follow-through, Hanna said.",
      "\"Some of these things he can do with the stroke of a pen,\" Hanna said, while noting it's unclear how his administration or Congress will react.",
      "\"He was pretty clear that this is happening, so I'm going to be keenly watching how first, [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio deals with this, because he can lift some of these sanctions with the stroke of a pen,\" Hanna said. \"There are other big issues with sectoral sanctions and the Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"There's a lot to unravel,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the timeline on lifting the sanctions during remarks in Turkey on Thursday, Rubio said, \"I was with the president when he made the decision to do this and included it in his speech. So we've been doing preparatory work in that regard.\"",
      "He said Trump intends to use waiver authorities under the Caesar Act, which have to be renewed every 180 days.",
      "\"Ultimately, if we make enough progress, we'd like to see the law repealed because you're going to struggle to find people to invest in a country when in six months, sanctions could come back,\" Rubio said. \"We're not there yet. That's premature. I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions. I think as we make progress, hopefully we'll be in a position soon, or one day, to go to Congress and ask them to permanently remove the sanctions.\"",
      "As negotiations are ongoing over Iran's nuclear program, Hanna noted the technical and diplomatic effort that went into the negotiations over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal the Obama administration agreed to but which Trump pulled the U.S. out of three years later.",
      "\"Those negotiations were highly technical, highly detailed, very lengthy. And that's not the way that Trump likes to operate, or [U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve] Witkoff, right? They're not details guys. They're the big picture, deal-making piece of it,\" he said.",
      "He added, \"But for something like a nuclear agreement with Iran, there's a lot that is required to make an agreement real, and that requires a lot of technical and diplomatic capacity. And if we got to that stage, it really would be a pretty big challenge -- even if everybody got on the same page -- to turn an agreement in principle into an agreement on paper.\"",
      "Dorraj said Trump's transactional foreign policy can be an asset in the short term but \"the drawback is there's no long-term strategy.\"",
      "\"These are quick initiatives,\" he said. \"The pragmatic part of it -- 'let's see what works. Let's see what will get us to the deal that we want. We will learn as we go along, and we will adopt and adjust as needed.' Okay, so that can be an asset. But also you are zigzagging, flipflopping. You are changing course on a daily basis. Your parties you're negotiating with, they're on slippery ground. They don't know what to count on, and that does not give us an image of continuity.\"",

      "The Army will place large metal plating at key points on Washington's streets",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army will place large metal plates at key points on the streets of Washington to better protect the pavement from the movements of 25 M1 Abrams main battle tanks set to roll through the capital on June 14, a U.S. official told the Associated Press.",
      "The tanks are a key part of a parade that will honor the Army's 250th birthday and fall on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Since it was announced, the parade has grown in scope and participation, and one of the highlights will be columns of tanks rolling in formation along Constitution Avenue. Each Abrams tank can weigh 60 tons or more and carry a crew of four.",
      "Concerns over the tanks' weight, and what that would do to D.C.\u2018s streets, ultimately kept them from being used for a parade during Trump\u2019s first term. The metal plates are seen as the best way to protect the streets Each plate weighs hundreds of pounds and will be placed at points along the parade route where the tanks will turn \u2014 and where their metal and rubber-shoed tracking that helps them move can do the most damage, the official said.",
      "In April, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said if the tanks are used on the city's roads, funding to repair the damage they may do should also be part of the plan. Her office was not immediately available for comment on Friday.",
      "Movement of a single M1 Abrams tank is a loud affair \u2014 movement of 25 in unison is expected to be thunderous, the official said.",
      "The parade and celebration will likely cost between $25 million and $45 million, a White House official told The Associated Press. It will involve thousands of troops also marching in formation, in uniforms representing every U.S. conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War, which began in 1775.",
      "Each war will have 60 troops in period costume, followed by 400 troops from that same unit in their regular battle dress uniforms. For example, the Civil War will be represented by the Army's 4th Infantry Division, based in Fort Carson, Colorado, with 60 soldiers wearing historical costumes and 400 in today's uniforms.",
      "Overall the parade plans call for about 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles and 50 helicopters to follow a route from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall.",
      "The late-afternoon parade will be followed by a parachute jump by the Army's Golden Knights, a concert and the fireworks.",

    "story": [
      "Cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of uninsured.",
      "Key components of the bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda looks to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) works with state programs to administer Medicaid, under which more than 71.2 million people are enrolled.",
      "Medicaid offers benefits including nursing home care, personal care services and assistance paying for premiums and other costs, according to CMS.",
      "An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of people without health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034.",
      "\"Medicaid is an important safety net for so many Americans,\" Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told ABC News. \"When we look at the most vulnerable and most underserved, it's going to impact these groups disproportionately.\"",
      "Many Republicans have insisted that cuts to Medicaid are only to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse and will not result in lost coverage for those who need it, which was repeated during testimony this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "But some Americans who rely on Medicaid for their own coverage, or coverage for their families, told ABC News they're worried that cuts could reduce their ability to receive health care, or force them to choose between paying for coverage or paying for necessities.",
      "'I feel very scared'",
      "Rosa Andresen, from Southgate, California, has been her 27-year-old daughter's caregiver for the past 13 years.",
      "Her daughter, Amanda, is disabled and has conditions including cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. Over a decade ago, Andresen left her job at a data entry retrieval company to care for her daughter full time.",
      "Andresen, 54, said Amanda is covered by Medicare and Medicaid, which has helped pay for diapers, seizure medication and mobility tools such as a shower chair and a ramp to help her go up and down stairs.",
      "It's unclear if Amanda would lose Medicaid coverage under the new proposal but, if she did, it would be a massive blow to her care, Andresen said.",
      "\"It's very devastating,\" Andresen told ABC News. \"I'm very, very sad, and I feel very scared for my daughter's well-being. It could drastically affect her health and her life, the quality of life that she has.\"",
      "Andresen said she is scared that she will receive a letter in the mail telling her that her daughter is no longer eligible for Medicaid or she'll take Amanda to a doctor's appointment and find out that her daughter cannot receive care there or can no longer be prescribed a certain medication.",
      "She said she has tried to see if she could get private insurance for her daughter, such as through her husband's job, but insurance companies allegedly told her they don't cover people with chronic illnesses.",
      "According to the HHS, \"health insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage to you or your child because of a pre-existing health condition like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, as well as pregnancy\".",
      "While California does have Medi-Cal, which is the state's implementation of the federal Medicaid program, Andresen said she doesn't know what the program would cover and what she would have to pay out of pocket.",
      "\"I use government assistance to buy food, like the [electronic benefit transfer], to put food at my table and if I have to also use money out of my pocket, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it if I [have to] decide to buy my daughter's medication or put food on the table,\" Andresen said.",
      "Work requirements could jeopardize care",
      "Four years ago, Jodie Montplaisir, a mother-of-five from Northhampton, Massachusetts, was struggling with opioid use disorder. She was unhoused, unemployed and separated from her children.",
      "Montplaisir said she realized she had hit a low point and needed help. She entered an opioid treatment program (OTP), paid for by Medicaid.",
      "\"I really just was like, 'I need to fix my life,' and I did,\" Montplaisir, 38, told ABC News. \"I really stuck in with the clinic and doing all of the meetings, all the groups, all my therapy, just really utilizing the clinic \u2026 and they really helped me.\"",
      "Montplaisir is now three years into her recovery, currently living in an apartment, reunited with her children and has a job working with unhoused people.",
      "Medicaid currently covers her medication-assisted treatment, and she attends clinic weekly to stay accountable. However, she fears any interruption, such as red tape or new requirements, could jeopardize her progress.",
      "\"If I didn't have Medicaid, I wouldn't have been able to do the clinic,\" she said. \"There's absolutely no way possible. If I didn't have Medicaid and the help of the system, I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.\"",
      "The Republicans' proposed bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.",
      "Not all Republicans are in favor the bill in its current form. A growing number of House GOP members are expressing grievances, some because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans and others because it does not include some of the most drastic cuts that Republican hardliners were pushing for.",
      "Montplaisir said if work requirements were in place when she was in OTP, it would have made it impossible for her to focus on her recovery, and it will make it difficult for the unhoused people she now works with.",
      "While the draft language has exemptions for certain adults, including those who have substance use disorder, Montplaisir worries proving an exemption could be complex and may result in lost coverage anyway.",
      "Additionally, trying to prove work requirements as opposed to focusing on recovery could derail people's progress, she said.",
      "\"Medicaid is there to help us ... how we supposed to work if we're trying to get sober?\" Montplaisir said. \"If I had to have paid money while I'm trying to get sober or having to work while I'm trying to get sober, it wouldn't work.\"",

      "The survey marks four consecutive months of dampening consumer sentiment.",
      "Consumer attitudes soured in May for the fourth consecutive month, even as President Donald Trump dialed back some tariffs. The reading came in below the level economists expected.",
      "Shopper sentiment now hovers near its lowest level since a severe bout of inflation three years ago, University of Michigan survey data on Friday showed. Before that, the measure of consumer attitudes hadn't ever fallen this low.",
      "The monthslong decline in consumer sentiment traces back to inflation fears and recession warnings set off by Trump\u2019s initial rollout of levies.",
      "A trade agreement between the U.S. and China this week slashed tit-for-tat tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies and triggered a surge in the stock market. Within days, Wall Street firms softened their forecasts of a recession.",
      "University of Michigan conducted the consumer survey between April 22 and May 13, a day after the agreement between the U.S. and China. The results, in turn, may not fully reflect the impact of the U.S.-China accord.",
      "The U.S.-China agreement marked the latest softening of Trump\u2019s levies, coming weeks after the White House paused far-reaching \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries. Trump also eased sector-specific tariffs targeting autos, and rolled back duties on some goods from Mexico and Canada.",
      "The drawdown of tariffs coincided with data suggesting the economy remains in solid shape.",
      "Inflation eased slightly last month, dropping to its lowest level since 2021, government data this week showed. Plus, the economy continues to add jobs at a solid pace.",
      "Still, uncertainty looms over the economic outlook.",
      "An array of tariffs remain in place, including an across-the-board 10% levy that applies to imports from nearly all countries. Additional tariffs have hit auto parts, as well as steel and aluminum.",
      "Even after the pullback, a 30% tariff on China far exceeds the level before Trump took office, posing a risk of price increases for a large swathe of products that includes apparel, toys and some electronics.",
      "Walmart executives on Thursday warned of tariff-driven price increases for perishable imports such as coffee, avocados, bananas and roses, as well as toys and electronics.",
      "Consumers showed signs of weakness last month as retail sales slowed, indicating shoppers may be pulling back as they await possible fallout from tariffs. The trend poses a risk for the wider economy, since consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "The U.S. economy shrank at the outset of this year, registering a sharp drop-off from robust growth over the final months of 2024.",
      "But a surge of imports ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs likely clouded the figure, since the calculation subtracts imports in an effort to exclude foreign production from the calculation of gross domestic product. Analysts cautioned that a lowering of GDP on account of this trend would not reflect economic weakness.",

      "Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman and Chip Roy all voted against clearing the bill out of committee -- defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson. The group complained, in part, that the bulk of savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office.",
      "The committee vote failed with just 16 lawmakers in favor, and 21 voting against.",
      "The move is a setback for Johnson and Trump, who earlier called on the holdouts to fall in line and unite behind the bill -- with Trump saying in a social media post that \"we don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party.\"",
      "Norman said he wants commitments from leadership on changes to Medicaid work requirements, which won't take effect until 2029 and imposes more frequent eligibility checks for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I am tired of smoke and mirrors,\" Norman said Friday. \"This isn't a grandstand. I don't need to grandstand.\"",
      "The ordeal has been yet another test of Johnson's speakership as he works to placate the hard-liners and unify the factions of his conference.",
      "House Republican leaders will now continue to negotiate with holdouts behind closed doors, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. While the delay is not ideal, there is still a chance that the bill could clear the House before the Memorial Day recess.",

The White House expects ALL Republicans to vote for this bill and successfully pass it through Committee in the near future,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X Friday afternoon.",
      "Asked by ABC News Capitol Hill Correspondent Jay O'Brien if he was concerned that five Republicans voted against the tax and budget measure even though Trump directed them to get on board with it, Rep. Smucker -- who voted no -- said it was \"part of the process.\"",
      "\"I mean, this happens in multiple bills. It ... happened to the Democrats last cycle -- it took a while to get their agenda done,\" Smucker said. \"We're a diverse conference and with a very tight margin, and so it takes a while to work through these, and it's was a very aggressive ... timeline that the speaker had put forward, and I think we're going to still meet that.\"",
      "Republicans agonized over this legislation for months, and for it to fail is an \"embarrassment\" for the holdouts, said Republican Rep. Tom McClintock.",
      "\"It is an embarrassment to the individuals responsible for those votes that's for sure\u2026 that's a matter they are going to have to discuss with their constituents over the weekend and hopefully they will feel the heat and see the light,\" he said.",
      "Budget Committee Chair Jody Arrington insisted Friday's failure was still a \"good first step\" because it forced members to take a position. Arrington told reporters he doesn't think Trump needs to start personally calling the holdouts.",
      "The chairman was adamant this bill can still pass by Johnson's goal of Memorial Day.",
      "\"[Trump] wants this done, and he wants it done at the earliest, practical time, and the commitment has been Memorial -- by Memorial Day, and we've been on pace, or ahead of schedule, to accomplish that,\" Arrington said.",
      "But time is running out.",
      "Even if the bill eventually gets out of committee, Johnson still doesn't have the votes to pass it on the floor next week. Hard-liners still want changes to Medicaid and other spending measures, even with this expected vote just days away.",
      "Prior to the failed vote, Majority Leader Steve Scalise explained that the bill's timeline enables the administration to \"actually create a process to implement\" some of the provisions in the bill.",
      "\"We've got a pretty clear idea of what the final pieces are, and we're working through those right now,\" Scalise said. \"We're all in agreement on the reforms we want to make. We want to have work requirements. We want to phase out a lot of these green subsidies. You know, how quickly can you get it done? And it's not as quickly as saying you just turn it off tomorrow.\"",
      "Rep. Marlin Stutzman, another Republican on the Budget Committee, sympathized with Norman's \"fair\" concerns about delays to implementing Medicaid reforms, but he called the consensus product of 11 markups \"a good start\" and stressed that the Senate will have an opportunity to improve the bill.",
      "\"There's a lot of good pieces in this legislation. You know, there's pieces that I feel like we left ourselves short. We could have made bigger reforms, cut more spending, but at the end of the day, this is going to get the economy growing for the American people,\" he said. \"I think we are going to get there.\"",

      "The Trump administration has been pushing back against certain court rulings it doesn't like in the hundreds of cases filed against it in the past few months",
      "DENVER -- Tucked deep in the thousand-plus pages of the multitrillion-dollar budget bill making its way through the Republican-controlled U.S. House is a paragraph curtailing a court\u2019s greatest tool for forcing the government to obey its rulings: the power to enforce contempt findings.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the bill can pass the House in its current form \u2014 it failed in a committee vote Friday \u2014 whether the U.S. Senate would preserve the contempt provision or whether courts would uphold it. But the fact that GOP lawmakers are including it shows how much those in power in the nation's capital are thinking about the consequences of defying judges as the battle between the Trump administration and the courts escalates.",
      "Republican President Donald Trump raised the stakes again Friday when he attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for its ruling barring his administration from quickly resuming deportations under an 18th-century wartime law: \u201cTHE SUPREME COURT WON\u2019T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\u201d Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social.",
      "The most intense skirmishes have come in the lower courts.",
      "One federal judge has found that members of the administration may be liable for contempt after ignoring his order to turn around planes deporting people under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump's administration has scoffed at another judge\u2019s ruling that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, even though the Supreme Court upheld that decision.",
      "In other cases, the administration has removed immigrants against court orders or had judges find that the administration is not complying with their directives. Dan Bongino, now Trump's deputy director of the FBI, called on the president to \u201cignore\u201d a judge\u2019s order in one of Bongino's final appearances on his talk radio show in February.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s going to arrest him? The marshals?\u201d Bongino asked, naming the agency that enforces federal judges\u2019 criminal contempt orders. \u201cYou guys know who the U.S. Marshals work for? Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "The rhetoric obscures the fact that the administration has complied with the vast majority of court rulings against it, many of them related to Trump's executive orders. Trump has said multiple times he will comply with orders, even as he attacks by name judges who rule against him.",
      "While skirmishes over whether the federal government is complying with court orders are not unusual, it's the intensity of the Trump administration's pushback that is, legal experts say.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me they are walking as close to the line as they can, and even stepping over it, in an effort to see how much they can get away with,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect from a very clever and mischievous child.\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, whose Article III Project pushes for pro-Trump judicial appointments, predicted that Trump will prevail over what he sees as hostile judges.",
      "\u201cThe more they do this, the more it's going to anger the American people, and the chief justice is going to follow the politics on this like he always does,\u201d Davis said.",
      "The clash was the subtext of an unusual Supreme Court session Thursday, the day before the ruling that angered the president. His administration was seeking to stop lower courts from issuing nationwide injunctions barring its initiatives. Previous administrations have also chafed against national orders, and multiple Supreme Court justices have expressed concern that they are overused.",
      "Still, at one point, Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer over his assertion that the administration would not necessarily obey a ruling from an appeals court.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d asked Barrett, who was nominated to the court by Trump.",
      "Sauer contended that was standard Department of Justice policy and he assured the nation\u2019s highest court the administration would honor its rulings.",
      "Some justices have expressed alarm about whether the administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown-Jackson, both nominated by Democratic presidents, have warned about government disobedience of court orders and threats toward judges. Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by a Republican president, George W. Bush, issued a statement condemning Trump's push to impeach James E. Boasberg, the federal judge who found probable cause that the administration committed contempt by ignoring his order on deportations.",
      "Even after the Supreme Court upheld a Maryland judge\u2019s ruling directing the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the White House account on X said in a post: \u201che's NOT coming back.\u201d",
      "Legal experts said the Abrego Garcia case may be heading toward contempt.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis has complained of \u201cbad faith\u201d from the administration as she orders reports on what, if anything, it\u2019s doing to comply with her order. But contempt processes are slow and deliberative, and, when the government\u2019s involved, there\u2019s usually a resolution before penalties kick in.",
      "Courts can hold parties to civil litigation or criminal cases in contempt for disobeying their orders. The penalty can take the form of fines or other civil punishments, or even prosecution and jail time, if pursued criminally.",
      "The provision in the Republican budget bill would prohibit courts from enforcing contempt citations for violations of injunctions or temporary restraining orders \u2014 the two main types of rulings used to rein in the Trump administration \u2014 unless the plaintiffs have paid a bond. That rarely happens when someone sues the government.",
      "In an extensive review of contempt cases involving the government, Yale law professor Nick Parrillo identified only 67 where someone was ultimately found in contempt. That was out of more than 650 cases where contempt was considered against the government. Appellate courts reliably overturned the penalties.",
      "But the higher courts always left open the possibility that the next contempt penalties could stick.",
      "\u201cThe courts, for their part, don\u2019t want to find out how far their authority goes,\u201d said David Noll, a Rutgers law professor, \u201cand the executive doesn\u2019t really want to undermine the legal order because the economy and their ability to just get stuff done depends on the law.\u201d",
      "Legal experts are gaming out whether judges could appoint independent prosecutors or be forced to rely on Trump\u2019s Department of Justice. Then there\u2019s the question of whether U.S. marshals would arrest anyone convicted of the offense.",
      "\u201cIf you get to the point of asking the marshals to arrest a contemnor, it\u2019s truly uncharted territory,\u201d Noll said.",
      "There\u2019s a second form of contempt that could not be blocked by the Department of Justice \u2013- civil contempt, leading to fines. This may be a more potent tool for judges because it doesn\u2019t rely on federal prosecution and cannot be expunged with a presidential pardon, said Justin Levitt, a department official in the Obama administration who also advised Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cShould the courts want, they have the tools to make individuals who plan on defying the courts miserable,\u201d Levitt said, noting that lawyers representing the administration and those taking specific actions to violate orders would be the most at risk.",
      "There are other deterrents courts have outside of contempt.",
      "Judges can stop treating the Justice Department like a trustworthy agency, making it harder for the government to win cases. There were indications in Friday's Supreme Court order that the majority didn't trust the administration's handling of the deportations. And defying courts is deeply unpopular: A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 8 in 10 Americans say that if a federal court rules a Trump administration action is illegal, the government has to follow the court\u2019s decision and stop its action.",
      "That's part of the reason the broader picture might not be as dramatic as the fights over a few of the immigration cases, said Vladeck, the Georgetown professor.",
      "\u201cIn the majority of these cases, the courts are successfully restraining the executive branch and the executive branch is abiding by their rulings,\u201d he said.",

      "Sweeping research cuts in President Donald Trump's proposed budget would target an ocean-monitoring system that scientists say is crucial to predicting tsunami escape routes and hurricane intensity and helping ships navigate dangerous harbors safely",
      "Capt. Ed Enos makes his living as a harbor pilot in Hawaii, clambering aboard arriving ships in the predawn hours and guiding them into port.",
      "His world revolves around wind speeds, current strength and wave swells. When Enos is bobbing in dangerous waters in the dark, his cellphone is his lifeline: with a few taps he can access the Integrated Ocean Observing System and pull up the data needed to guide what are essentially floating warehouses safely to the dock.",
      "But maybe not for much longer. President Donald Trump wants to eliminate all federal funding for the observing system's regional operations. Scientists say the cuts could mean the end of efforts to gather real-time data crucial to navigating treacherous harbors, plotting tsunami escape routes and predicting hurricane intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last thing you should be shutting down,\u201d Enos said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money wasted. Right at a time when we should be getting more money to do more work to benefit the public, they want to turn things off. That\u2019s the wrong strategy at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\u201d",
      "The IOOS system launched about 20 years ago. It's made up of 11 regional associations in multiple states and territories, including the Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington state, Michigan, South Carolina and Southern California.",
      "The regional groups are networks of university researchers, conservation groups, businesses and anyone else gathering or using maritime data. The associations are the Swiss army knife of oceanography, using buoys, submersible drones and radar installations to track water temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, wave speeds, swell heights and current strength.",
      "The networks monitor the Great Lakes, U.S. coastlines, the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the Gulf of America, the Gulf of Alaska, the Caribbean and the South Pacific and upload member data to public websites in real time.",
      "Cruise ship, freighter and tanker pilots like Enos, as well as the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, use the information directly to navigate harbors safely, plot courses around storms and conduct search-and-rescue operations.",
      "The associations' observations feed into National Weather Service forecasts. The Pacific Northwest association uses tsunami data to post real-time coastal escape routes on a public-facing app. And the Hawaii association not only posts data that is helpful to harbor pilots but tracks hurricane intensity and tiger sharks that have been tagged for research.",
      "The associations also track toxic algal blooms, which can force beach closures and kill fish. The maps help commercial anglers avoid those empty regions. Water temperature data can help identify heat layers within the ocean and, because it\u2019s harder for fish to survive in those layers, knowing hot zones helps anglers target better fishing grounds.",
      "The regional networks are not formal federal agencies but are almost entirely funded through federal grants through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The current federal budget allocates $43.5 million for the networks. A Republican bill in the House natural resources committee would actually send them more money, $56 million annually, from 2026 through 2030.",
      "A Trump administration memo leaked in April proposes a $2.5 billion cut to the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, in the 2026 federal budget.",
      "Part of the proposal calls for eliminating federal funding for the regional monitoring networks, even though the memo says one of the activities the administration wants the commerce department to focus on is collecting ocean and weather data.",
      "The memo offered no other justifications for the cuts. The proposal stunned network users.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to build an incredible system and it\u2019s running smoothly, providing data that\u2019s important to the economy. Why would you break it?\u201d said Jack Barth, an Oregon State oceanographer who shares data with the Pacific Northwest association.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re providing is a window into the ocean and without those measures we frankly won\u2019t know what\u2019s coming at us. It's like turning off the headlights,\" Barth said.",
      "NOAA officials declined to comment on the cuts and potential impacts, saying in an email to The Associated Press that they do not do \u201cspeculative interviews.\u201d",
      "Nothing is certain. The 2026 federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1. The budget must pass the House, the Senate and get the president's signature before it can take effect. Lawmakers could decide to fund the regional networks after all.",
      "Network directors are trying not to panic. If the cuts go through, some associations might survive by selling their data or soliciting grants from sources outside the federal government. But the funding hole would be so significant that just keeping the lights on would be an uphill battle, they said.",
      "If the associations fold, other entities might be able to continue gathering data, but there will be gaps. Partnerships developed over years would evaporate and data won't be available in a single place like now, they said.",
      "\"People have come to us because we\u2019ve been steady,\" Hawaii regional network director Melissa Iwamoto said. \u201cWe\u2019re a known entity, a trusted entity. No one saw this coming, the potential for us not to be here.\u201d",

      "Libraries across the United States are cutting back on e-books, audiobooks and loan programs after the Trump administration suspended millions of dollars in federal grants as it tries to dissolve the Institute of Museum and Library Services.",
      "Federal judges have issued temporary orders to block the Trump administration from taking any further steps toward gutting the agency. But the unexpected slashing of grants has delivered a significant blow to many libraries, which are reshuffling budgets and looking at different ways to raise money.",
      "Maine has laid off a fifth of its staff and temporarily closed its state library after not receiving the remainder of its annual funding. Libraries in Mississippi have indefinitely stopped offering a popular e-book service, and the South Dakota state library has suspended its interlibrary loan program.",
      "E-book and audiobook programs are especially vulnerable to budget cuts, even though those offerings have exploded in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cI think everyone should know the cost of providing digital sources is too expensive for most libraries,\" said Cindy Hohl, president of the American Library Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous and growing need.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump issued an executive order March 14 to dismantle the IMLS before firing nearly all of its employees.",
      "One month later, the Maine State Library announced it was issuing layoff notices for workers funded through an IMLS grant program.",
      "\u201cIt came as quite a surprise to all of us,\u201d said Spencer Davis, a library generalist at the Maine State Library who is one of eight employees who were laid off May 8 because of the suspended funding.",
      "In April, California, Washington and Connecticut were the only three states to receive letters stating the remainder of their funding for the year was cancelled, Hohl said. For others, the money hasn\u2019t been distributed yet. The three states all filed formal objections with the IMLS.",
      "Rebecca Wendt, California state library director, said she was never told why California's funding was terminated while the other remaining states did not receive the same notice.",
      "\u201cWe are mystified,\u201d Wendt said.",
      "The agency did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Most libraries are funded by city and county governments, but receive a smaller portion of their budget from their state libraries, which receive federal dollars every year to help pay for summer reading programs, interlibrary loan services and digital books. Libraries in rural areas rely on federal grants more than those in cities.",
      "Many states use the funding to pay for e-books and audiobooks, which are increasingly popular, and costly, offerings. In 2023, more than 660 million people globally borrowed e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines, up from 19% in 2022, according to OverDrive, the main distributor of digital content for libraries and schools.",
      "In Mississippi, the state library helped fund its statewide e-book program.",
      "For a few days, Erin Busbea was the bearer of bad news for readers at her Mississippi library: Hoopla, a popular app to check out e-books and audiobooks had been suspended indefinitely in Lowndes and DeSoto counties due to the funding freeze.",
      "\u201cPeople have been calling and asking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I access my books on Hoopla?\u2019\u201d said Busbea, library director of the Columbus-Lowndes Public Library System in Columbus, a majority-Black city northeast of Jackson.",
      "The library system also had to pause parts of its interlibrary loan system allowing readers to borrow books from other states when they aren't available locally.",
      "\u201cFor most libraries that were using federal dollars, they had to curtail those activities,\" said Hulen Bivins, the Mississippi Library Commission executive director.",
      "The funding freeze came after the agency's roughly 70 staff members were placed on administrative leave in March.",
      "Attorneys general in 21 states and the American Library Association have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration for seeking to dismantle the agency.",
      "The institute's annual budget is below $300 million and distributes less than half of that to state libraries across the country. In California, the state library was notified that about 20%, or $3 million, of its $15 million grant had been terminated.",
      "\u201cThe small library systems are not able to pay for the e-books themselves,\u201d said Wendt, the California state librarian.",
      "In South Dakota, the state's interlibrary loan program is on hold, according to Nancy Van Der Weide, a spokesperson for the South Dakota Department of Education.",
      "The institute, founded in 1996 by a Republican-controlled Congress, also supports a national library training program named after former first lady Laura Bush that seeks to recruit and train librarians from diverse or underrepresented backgrounds. A spokesperson for Bush did not return a request seeking comment.",
      "\u201cLibrary funding is never robust. It's always a point of discussion. It's always something you need to advocate for,\u201d said Liz Doucett, library director at Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick, Maine. \u201cIt's adding to just general anxiety.\"",

      "A devastating tornado in Kentucky damaged homes, tossed vehicles and left many people homeless. Seventeen of the deaths were in Laurel County, located in the state's southeast, and one was in Pulaski County: Fire Department Maj. Roger Leslie Leatherman, a 39-year veteran who was fatally injured while responding to the deadly weather.",

      "Rescuers searched for survivors all night and into the morning, the sheriff's office said. An emergency shelter was set up at a high school and donations of food and other necessities were arriving.",
      "Resident Chris Cromer said he got the first of two alerts on his phone around 11:30 p.m., about a half-hour before the tornado struck. He and his wife grabbed their dog, jumped in their car and sought shelter in the crawlspace at a relative\u2019s nearby home because their own crawlspace is small.",

      "About 1,200 tornadoes strike the U.S. annually, and they have been reported in all 50 states over the years. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional \u201cTornado Alley\u201d of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South area.",
      "The latest Kentucky storms were part of a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said.

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with unusual restrictions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration has issued a long-awaited approval of Novavax\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine but with unusual restrictions.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based coronavirus vaccine \u2013 and until now it had emergency authorization from FDA for use in anyone 12 and older.",
      "But late Friday, the FDA granted the company full approval for its vaccine for use only in adults 65 and older \u2013 or those 12 to 64 who have at least one health problem that puts them at increased risk from COVID-19.",
      "Vaccines made by Novavax\u2019s competitors Pfizer and Moderna already are fully licensed for use in anyone 12 and older, and also are authorized for use in children as young as 6 months.",
      "Next month, influential advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were set to debate if yearly COVID vaccines still should be recommended for everyone or only certain people at higher risk. The Novavax decision suggests the Trump administration may already have decided how to proceed in advance of that meeting.",
      "Novavax chief executive John C. Jacobs welcomed the licensure.",
      "\u201cMarket research and U.S. CDC statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally. This significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option,\u201d he said.",
      "In its Friday approval letter, the FDA didn\u2019t explain the restrictions although they reflect skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials.",
      "Novavax originally showed its vaccine was safe and effective in a 30,000-person clinical trial. The FDA had been on track to grant Novavax full approval \u2013 without restrictions -- by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Novavax later announced the FDA instead was asking it to run an additional trial after approval, which is highly unusual. FDA did order several additional trials to be completed in the next few years, some examining whether the vaccine might be associated with some heart conditions. Another required study must assess the benefits of continuing vaccination in 50- to 64-year-olds who don\u2019t have health problems that increase their risk from COVID-19.",

      "NEW YORK -- A Mexican navy sailing ship hit the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday during a promotional tour in New York City, the top of its three masts slamming into the iconic span and partially collapsing as the boat floated in the East River.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams said 19 people were injured in the crash, four seriously, but the 142-year-old bridge was spared major damage. The cause of the collision was under investigation.",
      "In a scene captured in multiple eyewitness videos, the masts could be seen snapping and partially collapsing as they crashed into the deck of the bridge. Videos showed heavy traffic on the span at the time of the collision.",
      "The vessel, which was flying a giant green, white and red Mexican flag, then drifted toward the edge of the river as onlookers scrambled away from shore. Sailors could be seen aloft in the rigging on the damaged masts.",
      "Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told The Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap. Looking closer, they saw someone dangling from high on the ship.",
      "\u201cWe saw someone dangling, and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was just blurry or my eyes, and we were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone dangling from the harness from the top for like at least like 15 minutes before they were able to rescue them,\u201d Katz said.",
      "They said they saw two people removed from the ship on stretchers onto smaller boats.",
      "The Mexican navy said in a post on the social platform X that the Cuauhtemoc, an academy training vessel, was damaged in an accident with the Brooklyn Bridge that prevented it from continuing its voyage.",
      "It added that the status of personnel and material was under review by naval and local authorities, which were providing assistance.",
      "The Foreign Affairs Ministry said on X that its ambassador to the U.S. and officials from the Mexican consulate in New York were in contact with local authorities to provide assistance to \u201cthe affected cadets,\u201d but it did not mention injuries.",
      "The Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-foot (490-meter) main span supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city\u2019s transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction.",
      "The Cuauhtemoc \u2014 about 297 feet long and 40 feet wide (90.5 meters long and 12 meters wide), according to the Mexican navy \u2014 sailed for the first time in 1982.",
      "Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets' training. This year it left the Mexican port of Acapulco, on the Pacific coast, on April 6 with 277 people onboard, the navy said then.",
      "The Mexican consulate said May 13 on X that the Cuauhtemoc, also called the \u201cAmbassador and Knight of the Seas,\u201d arrived that day and docked at pier 17. It invited people to visit through May 17.",
      "The ship was scheduled to visit 22 ports in 15 nations, including Kingston, Jamaica; Havana, Cuba; Cozumel, Mexico; and New York.",
      "It also had planned to go to Reykjavik, Iceland; Bordeaux, Saint Malo and Dunkirk, France; and Aberdeen, Scotland, among others, for a total of 254 days, 170 of them at sea.",

      "The person believed responsible for an attack targeting a Southern California fertility clinic Saturday posted rambling online writings before an explosion that investigators are treating as an act of terrorism, according to a law enforcement official.",
      "The suspect, who died in the explosion that tore through the clinic and rattled the upscale California city of Palm Springs, also attempted to record video or stream the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss details of the attack and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.",

      "Authorities were still working to piece together a motive and build a chronology of events leading up to the attack.

      "Authorities have not released the identity of the person thought to be responsible but believe the individual died in a car explosion. Davis said investigators weren\u2019t looking for anyone else.",
      "Four others were injured but details of the severity of their injuries weren't shared.",
      "A burned-out vehicle was seen in the parking lot behind the clinic after the blast, which caved in the building\u2019s roof, sprayed debris across a five-lane road and shattered windows in businesses blocks away. The clinic was closed for the weekend, and the doctor who leads it told the AP its staffers were safe.",
      "The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, housed in a single-story building along a five-lane street lined with palm trees.",
      "Dr. Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, told the AP in a phone interview that the explosion damaged the practice\u2019s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients. The clinic's IVF lab and stored embryos are offsite and were not damaged.",

      "Rhino Williams, 47, said he was chatting with customers at a hotel restaurant he helps manage just over a block away when he heard a huge boom. Everything rattled, Williams said, and he sprinted to the scene to see if anyone needed help.",
      "Williams covered his nose with his shirt as he smelled burning plastic and rubber. He said he saw a building had \u201cblown out\u201d into the street, with bricks and debris scattered everywhere, and he spotted a car\u2019s front axle on fire in the parking lot.",
      "It was the only car in the lot, said Williams, who ran into the building, calling out and peering behind the counter to see if anyone was inside. He did not hear a response and did not see anyone behind the counter.",
      "Williams then ran around checking on other buildings. Multiple windows of the neighboring liquor store also were blown out. Once he saw authorities arrive, Williams headed back to the hotel, he said.",
      "Steven Michael Chacon was in his car preparing to turn into a hospital across the street from the clinic when felt and heard a massive boom as the building was torn apart, sending a massive plume of black smoke into the air. Not knowing what happened, he exited his car to flee the scene. Glass was all over the ground, and he saw what appeared to be a body part.",
      "\u201cI got out of my car and then people started screaming, there were people bloody, there was glass everywhere,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Beginning next school year, the curriculum standards for Oklahoma high school students will including conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history learn about the Industrial Revolution, women\u2019s suffrage and America's expanding role in international affairs.",
      "Beginning next school year, they will add conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s new social studies standards for K-12 public school students, already infused with references to the Bible and national pride, were revised at the direction of state School Superintendent Ryan Walters. The Republican official has spent much of his first term in office lauding President Donald Trump, feuding with teachers unions and local school superintendents, and trying to end what he describes as \u201cwokeness\u201d in public schools.",
      "\u201cThe left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,\u201d Walters said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it back to actually understanding history ... and I\u2019m unapologetic about that.\u201d",
      "The previous standard for studying the 2020 election merely said, \u201cExamine issues related to the election of 2020 and its outcome.\" The new version is more expansive: \u201cIdentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of \u2018bellwether county\u2019 trends.\u201d",
      "The new standard raised red flags even among Walters' fellow Republicans, including the governor and legislative leaders. They were concerned that several last-minute changes, including the language about the 2020 election and a provision stating the source of the COVID-19 virus was a Chinese lab, were added just hours before the state school board voted on them.",
      "A group of parents and educators have filed a lawsuit asking a judge to reject the standards, arguing they were not reviewed properly and that they \u201crepresent a distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.\u201d",
      "While many Oklahoma teachers have expressed outrage at the change in the standards, others say they leave plenty of room for an effective teacher to instruct students about the results of the 2020 election without misinforming them.",
      "Aaron Baker, who has taught U.S. government in high schools in Oklahoma City for more than a decade, said he\u2019s most concerned about teachers in rural, conservative parts of the state who might feel encouraged to impose their own beliefs on students.",
      "\u201cIf someone is welcoming the influence of these far-right organizations in our standards and is interested in inserting more of Christianity into our practices as teachers, then they\u2019ve become emboldened,\u201d Baker said. \u201cFor me, that is the major concern.\u201d",
      "Leaders in the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature introduced a resolution to reject the standards, but there wasn\u2019t enough GOP support to pass it.",
      "Part of that hesitation likely stemmed from a flurry of last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty, which has a large presence in Oklahoma and threatened lawmakers who reject the standards with a primary opponent.",
      "\u201cIn the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,\u201d the group wrote in a letter signed by several other conservative groups and GOP activists. \u201cIf you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.\u201d",
      "After a group of parents, educators and other Oklahoma school officials worked to develop the new social studies standards, Walters assembled an executive committee consisting mostly of out-of-state pundits from conservative think-tanks to revise them. He said he wanted to focus more on American exceptionalism and incorporate the Bible as an instructional resource.",
      "Among those Walters appointed to the review committee are Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and a key figure in its Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration, and Dennis Prager, a radio talk show host who founded Prager U, a conservative nonprofit that offers \u201cpro-American\u201d educational materials for children that some critics say are not accurate or objective.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Walters defended teaching students about \u201cunprecedented and historically significant\u201d elements of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"The standards do not instruct students on what to believe; rather, they encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine real events, review publicly available information, and come to their own conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states were Trump contested his loss all confirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory, and Trump lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.",
      "Critics say Walters' new standard is filled with misleading phrasing that seeks to steer the discussion in particular direction.",
      "Democrats characterized it as another political ploy by Walters, widely viewed as a potential candidate for governor in 2026, at the expense of school children.",
      "\u201cIt's harmful posturing and political theater that our kids do not need to be subjected to,\u201d said Sen. Mark Mann, a Democrat from Oklahoma City who previously served on the school board for one of the state's largest districts.",
      "National experts on education standards also expressed alarm, noting that Oklahoma has historically ranked highly among the states for its standards.",
      "Brendan Gillis, the director of teaching and learning at the American Historical Association who oversaw a research project that analyzed standards in all 50 states, said Oklahoma\u2019s social studies standards had been \u201cquite good\u201d until the latest version.",
      "In addition to concerns about election misinformation, Gillis added: \u201cThere was also a lot of biblical content that was sort of shoehorned in throughout the existing standards.\u201d",
      "He said a lot of the references to Christianity and the Bible misinterpreted the history of the country's founding and lacked historical nuance.",
      "David Griffith, a research director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education think-tank, said he was not aware of any other states that have tried to promote election misinformation in their curriculum standards.",
      "He called the new standards an \u201cunfortunate\u201d departure from Oklahoma's traditionally strong social studies standards.",
      "\u201cIt is just inappropriate to promote conspiracy theories about the election in standards,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Testimony in the sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs began this week, opening a window into what prosecutors say was the sordid world of group sex, drugs and violence beneath the glittering, jet set persona cultivated by the Bad Boy Records founder.",
      "Much of the testimony was hard to watch. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie, recounted being beaten and pressured into degrading sexual performances with strangers.",
      "Here are five key moments from the trial, which resumes Monday:",
      "Lawyer Teny Geragos took a novel approach to defending Combs in her opening statement.",
      "She conceded the hip-hop impresario has a \u201cbad temper\u201d and is prone to violent outbursts that are often fueled by alcohol, jealousy and drugs.",
      "But she maintained that while his actions might have warranted domestic violence charges, they aren\u2019t proof he engaged in sex trafficking and racketeering \u2014 the charges he faces.",
      "Geragos argued that Combs\u2019 sexual habits were part of a swinger lifestyle involving consenting adults and reminded jurors that \u201ckinky\u201d sexual predilections don\u2019t equate to sex trafficking.",
      "\u201cSean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case,\" she said. \u201cThis case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money.\u201d",
      "The packed courtroom fell silent when jurors were shown security camera video of Combs assaulting Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
      "The video depicts Cassie, an R&B singer, headed down a hallway toward the hotel\u2019s elevators just before Combs rounds a corner, strikes her and throws her to the ground before kicking her and then dragging her back toward their hotel room.",
      "Jurors also viewed photographs of damage in the hotel hallway, including flowers strewn on the floor and soil spattered against a wall. Later, as Cassie testified about the attack, they were shown photos of the musician\u2019s swollen lip.",
      "The trial\u2019s first witness was a former security guard at the hotel. Israel Florez testified Combs attempted to bribe him, holding out a stack of money with a $100 on top, telling him: \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d",
      "Florez said he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. Just go back into your room.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMe & U\u201d singer, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, testified that Combs was into voyeurism and dictated every aspect of sex events he dubbed \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "The highly orchestrated affairs, which Combs also called \u201cwild king nights\u201d or \u201chotel nights,\" involved male sex workers, heavy drug use and copious lubrication.",
      "\u201cIt was his fantasy,\u201d Cassie said.",
      "Cassie said each \u201cfreak-off\u201d involved about 10 large bottles of baby oil -- heated up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Combs also asked her to perform degrading and painful sex acts with male sex workers.",
      "Cassie said eventually she was doing \u201cfreak-offs\u201d weekly for a decade, with the final one in 2017 or 2018.",
      "\u201cThe freak-offs became a job,\u201d Cassie recounted.",
      "She said she felt she couldn't refuse because she feared the videos would be made public.",

      "In 1971, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a \u201cbottle bill.\"",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Monica Truax has lived in her Portland home since 1992, on a cul-de-sac she described as a close-knit community. But since a bottle redemption center opened next door several years ago, her block has struggled with drug dealing, garbage and fights in the middle of the night, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's just all completely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people are all still here, you know, all the residents are here still, and still raising their families.\u201d",
      "After more than five decades, Oregon's first-in-the-nation \u201cbottle bill\u201d \u2014 now replicated in nine other states \u2014 faces a potential overhaul, with lawmakers considering new time restrictions on bottle redemption sites that some say have become magnets for drugs and homelessness.",
      "The trailblazing law to reduce littering by incentivizing recycling helped cement the state's reputation as a leader in the emerging environmental movement. It has also become a financial security net for many, including those experiencing homelessness.",
      "The legislation echoes calls to modernize the bottle bill, with some saying changes are needed to address unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cHe did not envision this,\u201d Truax said of former Oregon Gov. Tom McCall, who signed the bottle bill into law. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mess.\u201d",
      "Consumers originally paid a 5-cent deposit on each eligible bottle or can, then collected the deposit when they redeemed the empty container at a retailer, such as a supermarket or convenience store.",
      "Over the years, the program has expanded accepted containers and increased the deposit to 10 cents. Twenty-seven centers exclusively for returns have been opened across the state.",
      "California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Vermont and the U.S. territory of Guam followed Oregon in adopting the concept, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In Oregon, people can sign up for accounts in which their refunds are deposited or choose cash redemptions. Some stores count containers by hand. Other sites have counting machines or areas where account holders can drop off bags of containers.",
      "The deposit has not kept pace with inflation \u2014 5 cents in 1971 would be equal to 40 cents today, according to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s inflation calculator \u2014 but many low-income residents rely on it.",
      "Stores must accept container returns when they are open, and owners of all-night convenience stores, particularly in Portland, say they're concerned about employee safety.",
      "In an op-ed for The Oregonian/OregonLive last year, Jonathan Polonsky, president and CEO of the Plaid Pantry chain of convenience stores, wrote that fentanyl was selling for less than $1 a pill and \u201ca small number of cans add up to enough to buy drugs.\u201d",
      "People redeeming containers at night \"may be belligerent and intimidating, presenting a major safety risk to our store associates who have no choice under Oregon\u2019s Bottle Bill to handle returns at that hour,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Truax, who lives with her husband in northeast Portland, said homeless encampments and people relieving themselves in public were among the many things she had witnessed on her block.",
      "\u201cI've seen it all,\u201d she said, describing the scourge of fentanyl as \u201cthe cherry on the sundae.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just sad,\" she added.",
      "At the bottle redemption center near Truax's home, Chris Grass waited with his father and girlfriend in the long line outside the door. They each redeemed the maximum amount of 350 containers per person per day for $105 in cash to help pay for gas and provide some extra money for things like cigarettes and coffee while he's unemployed, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don't like people that go out and can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's actually good for the environment.\"",
      "In 2023, roughly 87% of eligible containers were returned for redemption, according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. That was the highest rate in the nation that year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, which operates the bottle bill program on behalf of its distributor members.",
      "The bill being considered by lawmakers would allow stores across the state to refuse container returns after 8 p.m.",
      "In Portland, it would allow for \u201calternative\u201d redemption sites, including possible mobile sites such as trucks that travel to different neighborhoods. Nonprofits would run the alternative sites for people who redeem containers every day, relieving the pressure on retailers, particularly downtown.",
      "Stores in an area with an alternative drop site could limit or refuse hand-counted returns, with convenience stores specifically allowed to stop them at 6 p.m.",
      "The proposal is supported by retailers as well as groups like the Ground Score Association, whose members include \u201ccanners\u201d and waste pickers who collect containers for income. The association operates a Portland redemption center under a bridge called The People's Depot that processes some 38,000 containers daily, according to its website.",
      "It has pushed back against claims that the bottle bill fuels the fentanyl crisis and says most people redeeming bottles need the money to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cSince becoming manager of The People's Depot, I'm learning how polarizing The Oregon Bottle Bill is,\u201d the depot's operational manager Kristofer Brown said in written testimony supporting the bill.",
      "Unlike in some other states, Oregon\u2019s bottle bill program is run by the private beverage industry rather than state government. The Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative retains unredeemed deposits, which topped $30 million in 2019, according to a 2020 state audit of the bottle bill.",
      "The audit recommended several changes, including having some or all unredeemed deposits go to the state to help fund environmental programs.",
      "Consolidated Oregon Indivisible Network, a progressive advocacy group, said in written testimony supporting the bill that \u201cmoney is piling up in the bottle deposit fund\u201d and called for another government audit.",
      "The OBRC says unredeemed refunds go toward operating expenses for the beverage container redemption system.",
      "The Legislature has until late June to approve the bill, which received overwhelming approval in the Senate and is now in the House.",

    "story": [
      "House Republicans are in the final rounds of negotiations over a sweeping budget plan that has been significantly influenced by President Donald Trump's priorities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Republicans unveiled their sweeping tax cut plan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee had one last person to consult. He went to the White House, where he and President Donald Trump went over the legislation \u201cline by line.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very happy with what we\u2019re delivering,\u201d said Rep. Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri.",
      "Trump had every reason to be pleased. His imprint is all over on the bill making its way through the House, starting with its title \u2014 the \u201c One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\u201d",
      "The legislation realizes many of Trump's campaign promises, temporarily ending taxes on overtime and tips for many workers, creating a new $10,000 tax break on auto loan interest for American-made cars, and even creating a new tax-free \u201cMAGA account\u201d \u2014 a nod to his \u201dMake America Great Again\" movement, but in this case, it means \u201cMoney Accounts for Growth and Advancement.\u201d This would contribute $1,000 to children born in his second term.",
      "The Trump-inspired contours of the legislative package, months if not years in the making, reflect not only the president's considerable influence over the Republican Party, but also the hard political realities in the House, where Republicans have only the barest of majorities and often find it difficult to find consensus without Trump's involvement.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., effectively owes his job to Trump and has kept in constant contact with him during the negotiations, including during his overseas trip this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s excited about our forward progress,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou know, I keep him apprised of the developments, and he\u2019s had a busy time over there in the Middle East, and it\u2019s been good \u2014 he\u2019s in good spirits and we\u2019re in good spirits.\u201d",
      "The Republican bill runs a whopping 1,116 pages and includes more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code. The legislation would make permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term while reducing funding for programs involving food assistance, college financing and environmental protection.",
      "As talks over the bill have progressed, divisions have emerged among Republicans, particularly between fiscal hawks most concerned about federal deficits and others more focused on the impact of cuts back home.",
      "That's where Trump usually comes in, playing the \u201ccloser\u201d who turns no votes to yes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has gone out of his way to ask us: \u2018Are there any members you want me to call? Anybody that you want me to talk to?\u2019 And he calls them right then,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"He\u2019s been incredibly hands-on and incredibly helpful at getting the bill to where it is.\u201d",
      "Trump's involvement seems certain to grow as Johnson labors to get the tax package through the House by a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Conservatives slowed the process Friday, refusing to advance the tax package out of the House Budget Committee until it includes faster implementation of Medicaid changes and a more wholesale repeal of Biden-era green energy credits. They vowed to hold firm until their demands are met.",
      "Trump took notice, applying pressure even before the gavel went down on the failed committee vote.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need \u2018GRANDSTANDERS\u2019 in the Republican Party,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations were expected to stretch through the weekend, with the Budget Committee reconvening late Sunday night in hopes of a breakthrough.",
      "Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, predicted the tax package will ultimately get over the finish line once Trump \u2014 just returning from a tour of the Middle East \u2014 starts making calls to skeptical lawmakers.",
      "\u201cYou may have noticed he likes talking on the telephone,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Added Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, \u201cI think the only way we\u2019re going to get on track with it is with Trump.\u201d",
      "The close coordination with Republican leaders stands in stark contrast to Trump's first term, when the party first enacted a slew of personal and corporate tax breaks. Republicans quickly cobbled that tax package together in late 2017 after a disastrous attempt at fulfilling their central campaign promise -- repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "This time, White House aides have been in regular contact with GOP lawmakers as the tax bill progresses through drafts and markups, highlighting programs they aim to overhaul and provisions they\u2019d like to add or cut.",
      "The president \u201cis much more engaged in directing what happens than the first time because he and the leadership of Congress in 2017 were not seeing eye-to-eye,\" Scalise said. \"He didn\u2019t necessarily want health care to be the first thing that was done, and yet it was. This time around we talked a lot before he was sworn in to make sure we were all on the same page.\u201d",
      "Trump first began to set the course of the GOP's current legislative strategy back in January, when he posted to social media that Republicans should pass \u201cone powerful bill\u201d that would tackle all of the party\u2019s priorities instead of splitting the agenda into two packages.",
      "Senate Republicans argued for a different approach. They urged quick passage of a bill to provide billions for the Pentagon and Trump's immigration clampdown, saying a second tax package could wait until later.",
      "Trump wavered for a time, giving Republicans on Capitol Hill mixed signals over the best approach. But his original preference for one bill won out in the end, in part because House Republicans insisted their chamber could not do it any other way.",
      "Democrats uniformly oppose the package but have little power to stop it from becoming law if Republicans remain unified. As they continue to grapple with the party's losses in last year's election, Democrats have worked to mobilize public opposition to the bill, decrying it as a giveaway to the rich paid for with cuts to healthcare and other social services.",
      "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it \u201cone big, beautiful betrayal.\u201d",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to press ahead and get the tax package to the Senate, with hopes of getting it on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.",
      "Burchett said that while \u201ceverybody rises up in righteous indignation\u201d over the details, Republicans will start \u201ccoming to the table\u201d once Trump is fully engaged.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an NBA basketball game right now,\" Burchett said. \"Don\u2019t watch the game. Just wait till the last two minutes and then turn on the TV.\u201d",

      "A decade ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a volunteer organizer for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign",
      "Among Democrats on Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wields far more power than New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the progressive champions have the hearts of Democratic voters across the country.",
      "About three-quarters of Democrats have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of Sanders, while about half have a favorable view of Ocasio-Cortez, according to a recent survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Compare them with Schumer, an establishment Democrat, who is viewed favorably by only about a third of Democrats.",
      "Nearly the entire difference in favorability ratings between Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez can be explained by voters who said they don\u2019t know enough to form an opinion of AOC. Their unfavorable ratings among Democrats were essentially the same, around 15% for both.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, now 35, was an anonymous Sanders campaign volunteer a decade ago. Now she\u2019s perhaps the best positioned to be the 83-year-old Sanders\u2019 successor atop his progressive movement as the Democratic Partytries to position itself in Trump\u2019s America.",
      "But that role comes with risks \u2014 President Donald Trump and Republicans have long made AOC a foil, and some Democrats, progressive and moderate alike, have argued she and Sanders are too disruptive and push for unrealistic policy ideas.",
      "Sanders and AOC have long portrayed their political relationship as familial. She used to call him \u201cTio Bernie,\u201d Spanish for \u201cUncle Bernie.\u201d He recently held her hand onstage in front of a huge crowd and said, tongue in cheek, \u201cI want to say a word about my daughter.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Sanders, Anna Bahr, said Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are \u201callies, collaborators and friends who built their relationship around a shared vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, the congresswoman represents what Bernie has been advocating for decades: When working-class people in this country stand up against the entrenched political elite and fight to fix an economic system propelled by uncontrollable greed, they will win,\u201d Bahr said.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez returned home to the Bronx after graduating from Boston University in 2011. She was a volunteer organizer for Sanders' 2016 campaign, his first presidential run and one that built a national movement around his vision of democratic socialism, even as he lost to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "When she decided to run for office herself, AOC had virtually no money but was assisted by progressive organizations, among them Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats, with ties to veterans of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.",
      "Sanders was quick to congratulate his virtually unknown prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in June 2018 after she defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of the Democratic leadership and potential future speaker, in the primary.",
      "A month later, they campaigned together in Kansas for two progressive House candidates and sat for a joint interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust two years ago, we were both in St. Mary\u2019s Park in the South Bronx. I was in the crowd with thousands of other people across ages, races, creeds, incomes. And to be here two years later pushing that revolution in Kansas is pretty amazing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during their joint Kansas appearance.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez began her congressional career in 2019 by introducing the Green New Deal. The ambitious proposal called for transforming the U.S. economy by eliminating fossil fuels while creating national health care coverage and job guarantees, as well as high-quality education and affordable housing. It has been criticized by Republicans and many Democrats for its cost and the potential disruption that would be caused by a restructuring of the economy.",
      "It was only a nonbinding resolution, but the Green New Deal became a major issue in the 2020 Democratic primary and a lightning rod for criticism on the right, further cementing Ocasio-Cortez as a power player in Democratic politics.",
      "By late 2019, Sanders was struggling in his second White House campaign. Much of the Democratic field \u2014 notably Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 had co-opted pieces of his agenda and split the progressive coalition.",
      "Then, Sanders suffered an untimely heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas. He needed a boost, and it came from Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "She bestowed her endorsement during a rally at a park in her congressional district. She later campaigned with him in the crucial early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and she seconded his nomination at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "As the Sanders presidential campaign floundered, Ocasio-Cortez was conflicted about whether to endorse him, according to a book published years later. Just months into her first term in Congress and already one of the best-known members of the House, she was still uncomfortable speaking to crowds and still feeling out how to build and wield her influence, aides told the authors of \u201cThe Truce: Progressives, Centrists, and the Future of the Democratic Party.\" The book was published last year and excerpted in Vanity Fair magazine.",
      "Corbin Trent, her first communications director in the House, threatened to quit when Ocasio-Cortez floated delaying the rally, according to the book. He told the authors he remembered a \u201cbig argument\" about the episode. Even as she campaigned for Sanders, she worried she'd be outshined and her star power would evaporate as quickly as it arrived.",
      "After Sanders lost the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, they continued occasional joint appearances, campaigning for progressive candidates or discussing topics such as the early response to COVID-19, union activism and climate change. As the 2024 election approached, they campaigned together for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee who replaced Biden after his debate performance.",
      "Trump's return to the White House left Democrats dejected and searching for a way forward. Sanders answered with a series of rallies he called his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, an attempt to push the rebuilding party to lead the working class in existential struggle against wealthy elites.",
      "After a few solo rallies, he invited AOC to come along.",
      "She introduced him, as she had years prior, as the inspiration for her own political career. But she added more depth.",
      "\u201cI know that one of the things that inspired me to run for office for the first time is that when I saw Sen. Sanders on television, and I was wiping tables down and saw the TV on and saying, every person in this country deserves health care as a human right,\" she told a crowd in Tempe, Arizona, in March. \"And I know it made me feel almost for the first time that this isn\u2019t something that we should earn. This is something that should be afforded to all of us because we are human. I just want to thank him, and so let\u2019s give him the most earthshaking round of applause.\u201d",
      "Sanders has resisted talking publicly of naming a successor while noting that he will not run for president again in 2028, when he turns 87. But holding her hand in Salt Lake City last month, he told a roaring crowd that he considered AOC to be family.",
      "\u201cNow I want to say a word about my daughter. I want to say a word about Alexandria and why what she\u2019s doing is so important,\" he said. \"Six years ago, what were you doing for a living? She was a waitress. But she looked around her and she saw a society that was fundamentally unjust and in many ways ugly to the people in the community in which she lived in New York City. She stood up and took on one of the most powerful people in the House of Representatives.\u201d",

      "The governor also noted in his veto letter that Black politicians have risen to the highest levels of government in the state in recent years. For example, U.S. Senator Angela Alsobrooks is the state's first Black U.S. senator. Maryland also has a Black attorney general, a Black state House speaker and a Black treasurer.",
      "\u201cWe have moved in partnership with leaders across the state to uplift Black families and address racial disparities in our communities,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThat is the context in which I\u2019ve made this difficult decision.

Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.\u201d",

      "\u201cAt a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives, and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,\" the caucus said in the statement. \u201cInstead, the State\u2019s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement.\u201d",
      "The measure passed with strong support in the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. The House voted 101-36 for the bill, and the Senate approved it 32-13. Both chambers approved the measure with margins large enough to override a veto, if all members who voted for the bill decided to vote to override the governor's veto.",
      "The legislature ended its regular 90-day session last month, and it would not take up veto overrides until lawmakers gather again, whether next year's regularly scheduled 90-day session in January, or a special session this year, if one were to be called.",
      "The governor's veto was one among 23 announced by the governor late Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cThe Senate will closely evaluate each veto from the Governor's Office and have more details on possible action in the near future,\" said David Schuhlein, a spokesman for Senate President Bill Ferguson.",
      "House Speaker Adrienne Jones issued a statement specifically on the governor's veto of creating the commission, saying \u201cI am proud of all our work during the 2025 session and grateful to lead a state that has always put these issues at the forefront of our policy discussions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work is not done, and I remain committed to working alongside all our partners to continue righting historical inequities,\u201d the speaker, a Democrat, added.",
      "Potential reparations outlined in the bill included official statements of apology, monetary compensation, property tax rebates, social service assistance, as well as licensing and permit fee waivers and reimbursement. Reparations also could include assistance with making a down payment on a home, business incentives, childcare, debt forgiveness and tuition payment waivers for higher education.",
      "The governor wrote in his veto letter that over the last 25 years, Maryland has launched several commissions and study groups to examine the legacy of slavery in the state, from the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the State Commission to Coordinate the Study, Commemoration, and Impact of the History and Legacy of Slavery in Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe scholarship on this topic is both vast in scope and robust in scale,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cAnd we are grateful for the Marylanders who have contributed their expertise to the vital project of understanding how the legacy of slavery continues to impact Black communities in our state today.\u201d",
      "Last year, California lawmakers passed some of the nation\u2019s most ambitious legislation aimed at atoning for a legacy of racist policies that drove racial disparities for Black people. None of the bills provided widespread direct payments to Black Americans. Instead, California lawmakers approved the return of land or compensation to families whose property was unjustly seized by the government, and issuing a formal apology.",
      "New York City lawmakers approved legislation last year to study the city\u2019s significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A 28-year-old woman described Friday how she survived for weeks outdoors in California's eastern Sierra Nevada by foraging for food and drinking melted snow after a solo camping trip went awry during harsh winter weather.",
      "Tiffany Slaton detailed her ordeal during a news conference with the Fresno County Sheriff's Department, two days after she was found in a cabin that the owner had left unlocked in case wayward hikers needed shelter. Authorities said she had been there for only eight hours before the cabin's owner arrived and discovered her.",
      "Slaton described being caught in an avalanche at one point, causing her to fall and hurt her leg. She didn\u2019t say which day that happened. She had a bicycle, a tent, two sleeping bags and food, she said, but she ended up losing all of her equipment, leaving her with only a lighter, a knife and some snacks. She didn\u2019t describe how she lost her tent or other gear.",
      "After she fell, Slaton said she tried calling 911 five times with no success but got a GPS signal on her phone.",
      "\u201cI ended up on this very long, arduous journey that I journaled to try and keep sane and eventually managed to get to civilization,\u201d she said.",
      "Authorities called her survival stunning given the conditions. The cabin was more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where she had last been seen, and the mountains were covered in up to 12 feet (3.66 meters) of snow in some areas.",
      "\u201cI would have never anticipated her in my wildest dreams being able to get back as far as she did,\u201d Sheriff John Zanoni said.",
      "Slaton had been on an extended biking and backpacking trip that also included time in Oregon, department spokesman Tony Botti said. Her journey took her to the Sierras, where she decided to make the trek to the Mono Hot Springs before meeting a friend in mid-April, he said. She was last seen on April 20 by a security camera near Huntington Lake, an unincorporated mountain community, riding on a bicycle and also sitting on a sidewalk with a backpack.",
      "Slaton\u2019s parents, who live in Georgia, reported her missing on April 29 after they hadn't heard from her in a week.",
      "Slaton, who was a competitive archer in her home country of Bermuda, said her athleticism and foraging knowledge helped her survive. She had some snacks on her but eventually ran out.",
      "The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, Christopher Gutierrez, said his staff left cabin doors unlocked during the winter in case someone needed shelter during the frequent mountain snowstorms. His backcountry lodge sits in the Sierra Nevada about halfway between Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks and is a frequent stop for hikers on the John Muir and Pacific Crest trails.",
      "Slaton found safe haven in one of those cabins during an intense snowstorm where all she could see was white, she said. It was just eight hours later that Gutierrez arrived to open the cabin for the season, authorities said.",
      "\u201cIf he hadn't come that day, I think they would have found my body there,\u201d Slaton said.",
      "Two days earlier, the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s office called off a search that had covered more than 600 square miles (1,550 square kilometers) of the Sierra National Forest, with no luck. Searchers were hampered by heavy snow blocking many roads.",
      "Slaton emerged battered and bruised from the cabin Wednesday.",
      "When she saw Gutierrez, she ran up to him to give him a hug.",
      "\u201cI really do have a new faith in humanity,\u201d Slaton said of surviving her ordeal.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A Mexican citizen will face charges related to providing material support to a terrorist organization for the first time for allegedly conspiring to traffic guns, grenades, drugs and migrants for a drug cartel, U.S. prosecutors said Friday. The cartel was recently designated a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "An indictment alleging the crimes by Maria Del Rosario Navarro Sanchez, a 39-year-old Mexican, was unsealed Friday in the Western district of Texas. It was not immediately clear if Navarro Sanchez had a lawyer.",
      "It came just days after an indictment was unsealed in San Diego against two alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders on narco-terrorism charges.",
      "Navarro Sanchez was arrested by Mexican authorities on May 4, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office. Among the things found with her was a golden AR-15-style assault rifle.",
      "Prosecutors said Navarro Sanchez was assisting the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful and violent organized crime groups. She is alleged to have conspired to give the cartel grenades, buy guns for them, smuggle cash across the border and move drugs.",
      "Two men were also charged in the indictment, though not with providing material support to a terrorist organization.",
      "In February, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel was among eight Latin American criminal groups designated as foreign terrorist organizations the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. He had called for the move in an executive order signed in January.",
      "The \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d label is unusual because it deploys a terrorist designation normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of six Mexican organized crime groups to receive the designation.",
      "\u201cThe arrest of Maria del Rosario Navarro Sanchez should send a clear message to people who wish to align themselves with terrorist groups that they will be sought out and held to the highest extent of the law,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.",
      "Trump has made clear he wants to throw everything possible at Mexico's cartels for flooding the U.S. with fentanyl. Mexico's new administration has shown a willingness to help, pursuing cartel operations and making arrests like that of Navarro Sanchez.",

      "After a wildfire decimated a California high school\u2019s newsroom, destroying its cameras, computers and archived newspapers spanning six decades, one of the first offers of help that its journalism adviser received came from the other side of the country.",
      "Claire Smith, founding executive director of Temple University's sports media center, had known Lisa Nehus Saxon since they helped carve out a place for women journalists in Major League Baseball more than 40 years ago. They\u2019d supported each other through the days of being barred from locker rooms, and now with much of Palisades Charter High School damaged, Smith wanted to be there for her friend again.",
      "\u201cI just thought, \u2018What can we do? How can we help with healing?\u2019\u201d Smith said.",
      "Earlier this week, she traveled from Philadelphia to deliver the result of that offer: a university paper featuring the high school students\u2019 articles.",
      "Across nearly a dozen pages, the insert showcased articles on price gouging in the rental market after the wildfire and the school returning to in-person lessons, along with poignant firsthand accounts of losing everything to the fire. There were also poems and hand-drawn pictures by students from Pasadena Rosebud Academy, a transitional kindergarten through eighth-grade school in Altadena, California, that was destroyed in the fire.",
      "Wildfires in January ravaged the Los Angeles area, wiping out nearly 17,000 structures including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship.",
      "The Palisades high school, made up of about 3,000 students in Los Angeles, saw about 40% of its campus damaged and had to move temporarily into an old Sears building. Nehus Saxon estimated that around a quarter of its newspaper staff members lost their homes, with some forced to move out of the community and switch schools.",
      "This project, she and Smith said, was a way to give students a project to focus on after the tragedy while also providing them a place to tell a larger audience the experience of their community.",
      "Smith said she thought the project would be healing for the students \u201cbut also give them something that they could hold in their hands and, when they grow up, show their children and grandchildren.\"",
      "Inside a basement classroom in Santa Monica on Wednesday, Smith and Samuel O\u2019Neal, The Temple News\u2019 editor-in-chief, handed out the papers to the high school staff.",
      "It was the first time they had seen their Tideline articles in print, as the paper had moved online years ago due to the cost.",
      "Kate Swain, 18, a co-editor-in-chief for the paper, said it felt surreal to finally flip through the printed pages.",
      "\u201cBecause of everything that we\u2019ve gone through together, everything that we\u2019ve had to persevere through and everyone\u2019s had all these personal things that they\u2019ve been dealing with,\" she said. \"And yet simultaneously, we\u2019ve been pouring all this time and energy and all of our passion for journalism into writing these articles.\u201d",
      "Gigi Appelbaum, 18, a co-editor-in-chief of the paper who lost her home in the fire, said the project felt especially distinct because it involved people thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cThe fact that people from across the country are aware of what's going on with us and emphasize with our situation and want to get our voices out there, it\u2019s really special,\u201d said Appelbaum, who has been on the paper for four years.",
      "One of the things she lost in the fire was a box filled with important cards and messages. She said she plans to store her copy in a new box as she works to restart the collection.",
      "Smith and Nehus Saxon met in 1983 during a game between the Angels and Yankees in Anaheim, California. Nehus Saxon said she walked over to Smith to introduce herself and found her hustling to meet a deadline.",
      "\u201cWho knew that little introduction would blossom into this,\u201d said Nehus Saxon.",
      "In the years since, they\u2019ve traveled to London together for Major League Baseball\u2019s first games in Europe, and they cried together in 2017 as Smith became the first woman to win the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America\u2019s Career Excellence Award.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk every week,\u201d Nehus Saxon said. \u201cSometimes we can go, you know, months and months without talking. But all we have to do is send each other a text message and we know the other will be there immediately.\u201d",
      "That bond was made all the more clear when Nehus Saxon heard from Smith as fire engulfed her community. Her home was only three blocks from the school. While it survived the blaze, it\u2019s filled with led laden ash and may not be safe to live in for years.",
      "But with the help of Smith, she and her students have been able to move forward and produce the final edition of the school year. After the papers were handed out, Nehus Saxon kept one for the school's archive.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost everything you\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d Smith said.",

    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Secureworks.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.",
      "Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be \"shut down\" without government help over energy pricing.",
      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",
      "Pay row",
      "Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the \u00a34.5m pay he received the previous year was \"impossible to justify\".",
      "And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans.",
      "When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: \"I don't set my own pay.",
      "\"I think it's really difficult,\" he said. \"I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done.\""

      "Thomas-Symonds, who is leading the negotiations, said he was driven by \"ruthless pragmatism\" and focused on jobs, lower household bills and stronger borders.",
      "The minister also said the government would assess whether to contribute money to EU projects on a case-by-case basis, saying it would \"consider each one on its merits\".",

      "He said the government had not ruled out \"dynamic alignment\", which would see the UK and EU maintain equivalent regulatory standards on food and trade, despite the UK not being \"in the room\" when future decisions are taken.",

      "\"And if it is about to happen, then that is a surrender of some of Britain's sovereignty and we won't stand for it\".",
      "On a deal around whether young people from the EU can come to live and work in the UK and vice versa, Thomas-Symonds insisted he was negotiating around \"a smart and controlled scheme\", adding \"nobody is remotely suggesting that's freedom of movement. That's a red line for us\".",
      "The minister did not respond directly to questioning on whether there would be a cap on numbers or time-limited visas, such as in existing schemes with Australia and Canada, but did stress \"that control element is hugely important\".",

      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",

    "story": [
      "Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned.",
      "Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m at a rate of 20% \u2013 half the usual rate \u2013 saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget.",
      "In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without \"adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment\".",
      "The government said its inheritance tax reforms were \"vital\" and its commitment to farmers was \"steadfast\".",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "Efra's report said the tax reforms \"threaten to affect the most vulnerable\" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek \"appropriate professional advice\".",
      "National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay \"doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers\".",
      "He said the policy remained \"fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed\".",
      "The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme \"affected trust in the government\" and left many farmers \"at risk of becoming unviable\".",
      "When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it as another \"shattering blow\" to farmers.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure.",
      "But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that \"a restoration of trust is urgently required\".",
      "Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively.",
      "\"The government, however, seems to be dismissing farmers' concerns and ignoring the strength of feeling evidenced in the months of protests that saw tractors converge on Westminster and up and down the country,\" he added.",
      "The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its \"current disastrous policy\" on inheritance tax.",
      "It said the government should consider an alternative \"clawback\" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale.",
      "CLA president Victoria Vyvyan said the \"clawback\" proposal would limit the damage to family businesses while targeting \"those who have bought land to shelter wealth for short-term gain\".",
      "\"The government has dug itself into a deep hole by targeting family farms and businesses, and must now pause, listen and consult,\" she said.",
      "But a government spokesman said that under its changes three quarters of estates would continue to pay no inheritance tax at all, while\u202fthe remaining quarter would \"pay half the inheritance tax that most people pay\".",
      "He added that payments could be spread over 10 years, interest-free.",

      "The company said it could not offer guidance to investors about its profit expectations over the next three months, as it would ordinarily do, because of the \"dynamic nature\" of the situation.",

    "summary": "The Caribbean island is building a power station that will use steam naturally heated by volcanic rock.",
    "story": [
      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

      "The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.",
      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",

    "summary": "Giant tyre firms are testing tyres that can survive conditions on the Moon and Mars.",
    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

    "summary": "The government says \"every single penny\" raised by the policy will be spent on state schools.",
    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Those that have a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names a specific private school that can meet their needs do not have to pay VAT.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Have private school fees gone up?",
      "The ISC represents more than 1,400 private schools. It said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024.",
      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

    "summary": "Remember Monday had high hopes, but their Eurovision entry ended in 19th place. What went wrong?",
    "story": [
      "Oh no, not again.",
      "For the third year in a row, the UK has crashed out at Eurovision, taking 19th place out of a possible 26.",
      "It feels particularly cruel this time because our contestants, Remember Monday, got a lot of things right with their song, What the Hell Just Happened.",
      "Most notably, they could sing \u2013 and I mean, really, really sing.",
      "Lauren, Holly and Charlotte hit every harmony in their song, What The Hell Just Happened, with pinpoint precision, drawing on a decade of West End experience that's seen them star in everything from Matilda to Phantom Of The Opera.",
      "After toe-curling performances from Olly Alexander in 2024 and Mae Muller in 2023, their vocals were as strong as a lion's roar. So strong, in fact, that they caught the attention of former Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst.",
      "\"Harmonising on the Eurovision stage has hardly worked out in the past, but they're spot on,\" Conchita enthused before the final.",
      "\"Their confidence is incredible. You immediately trust them, because when you feel the artist is nervous, you get nervous as a viewer. But they are just so light and so sharp.\"",
      "So what went wrong?",
      "The chief culprit, if I'm honest, was the song.",
      "A manic mish-mash of musical styles, it sped up in the verses, and slowed down for the choruses, with all the consistency of a jelly in a heatwave.",
      "That's not to say it's a bad piece of writing.",
      "Indeed, all of the UK's 88 points came from professional juries of songwriters, whose job it is to recognise compositional craft. Italy even gave us the top score of 12. Grazie mille!",
      "They'll have recognised all the clever British touches the band crammed in \u2013 Elton John-style piano crescendos, a Beatles-esque mellotron riff, and a vocal callback to George Michael's Freedom '90.",
      "The lyrics were witty, too. Reminiscent of Katy Perry's Last Friday Night (TGIF), or If I Were a Bell from Guys and Dolls, it was all about the drunken mistakes you make while trying to get over an ex.",
      "\"Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee / When I fell from the chandelier.\"",
      "In three short minutes, the trio rattled off half a dozen memorable hooks, all imbued with the unbreakable bond of their friendship.",
      "But as seasoned Eurovision watcher Jonathan Vautrey noted, the song was simply too busy.",
      "\"It's hard to latch on to exactly what they're selling when you're too busy reeling from the constant whiplash of hearing an almost brand new song every 30 seconds,\" he wrote on the Wiwibloggs fansite last month..",
      "\"Although I've been able to settle into the entry overtime, and now appreciate the theatricality of it all, first impressions matter at Eurovision.\"",
      "That's an opinion I heard more than once. But still, I had hope.",

      "Eurovision act Remember Monday: 'The closer we get, the hungrier we become'",
      "Catching a tram to Basel's St Jackobshalle arena on Saturday, I was stopped by a Swedish woman who'd spotted my UK media pass.",
      "She wanted to tell me how she'd dismissed Remember Monday's song when auditioning this year's Eurovision songs on Spotify. Then she saw their spirited performance in the semi-final \"and I understood\".",
      "Good enough for one vote, then. So why didn't more people connect with it?",
      "The staging was put together by Ace Bowerman, who is one of the UK's most respected creative directors \u2013 responsible for Blackpink's Born Pink world tour and Dua Lipa's lockdown spectacular, Studio 2054.",
      "Speaking before the final, she told me the performance deliberately made a virtue of the girls' friendship.",
      "\"As soon as I met them, I was like, 'Please be my friend!'\" she told me,",
      "\"They are electric people, they have such a special bond. So the one thing I want everybody to take away from the performance is how much fun they are \u2013 because the audience will want to be their friends as well.\"",
      "It was camp and fun, but lacked the scale of Finland's Erika Vikman, who soared above the audience on a giant phallic microphone, or the drama of Austrian winner JJ, who was tossed around the stage in the stormy sea of his own emotions.",
      "\"The UK's staging wasn't flat at all but, as with the song, it was maybe a bit too much,\" says Alexander Beijar, Eurovision reporter at Finnish broadcaster Yle.",
      "\"It was like, we have three minutes, and we'll show you everything we can do on this stage: We'll start in bed, we'll dance on a chandelier, we'll strut down the catwalk, and we'll end up in the bed again in the end.",
      "\"I think maybe tone it down just a nod for next year.",
      "\"Then again, as a Finn, with the biggest microphone you can find in the whole of Switzerland, maybe I shouldn't give advice!\"",
      "Was it political?",
      "And what about that wrinkly old Eurovision chestnut: Politics?",
      "Vote trading is an age-old tradition at the contest. Since Sweden first took part in 1958, for example, more than one-fifth of its votes have come from Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland.",
      "But the situation is complicated. Political tensions persist in the Balkans, \"but the cultural connections seem to have trumped the political divisions\", Dean Vuletic, author of Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, recently told the AFP news agency.",
      "\"I would say that this is because these countries do share a music industry.\"",
      "The UK's music industry isn't particularly well integrated with Europe, tending to ride roughshod over its less influential neighbours.",
      "When it comes to friendly neighbours, our reputation took a hit after Brexit - although Luxembourg has always been a reliable source of votes, for reasons that aren't 100% clear.",
      "But here's the thing: You can only vote for a country in Eurovision, not against it.",
      "Remember Monday were good, but were they good enough to make your personal Top 10?",
      "If so, then great \u2013 you'd have given them some points. Otherwise, it's a struggle to accrue any momentum.",
      "In the end, that was Remember Monday's fate: Another zero-point disappointment.",
      "So where does that leave the UK going into next year?",
      "Well, we laid good foundations. Remember Monday didn't come with a copycat Eurodance hit, or an insipid ballad. The vocals were strong. The staging conveyed personality.",
      "Their energy was infectious and they made friends across Europe, becoming great ambassadors for the UK in the contest.",
      "Their 88 jury points almost doubled last year's score. We just have to find a way to get the public vote back on side.",
      "In other words, we shouldn't be too down on the band themselves, as Scott Mills and Graham Norton discussed on Radio 2 this weekend.",
      "\"I thought they were spectacular, so I don't really mind where they place, because it's not embarrassing,\" said Mills.",
      "\"I'm with you,\" Norton agreed. \"They're so likeable. Whatever happens, they walk away heads held high.\"",
      "Mills cautioned against the creeping allure of cynicism.",
      "\"There's a section of fans [who] will complain every year, whatever the UK does: 'Oh, the song's too generic, the vocals aren't great.'",
      "\"We could send Adele and they'd have something horrible to say.",
      "\"But the whole thing about Eurovision is that it's fun and it's joy through music\u2026 so please don't spoil it. Go and be miserable somewhere else.\"",
      "And that's exactly the attitude we need. The UK's never going to attract world-class talent if all we do is look down on the contest and approach it with a defeatist attitude.",
      "Luckily, three people have already put their names in the ring for next year.",
      "\"Listen,\" said Remember Monday's Lauren Byrne when I bumped into her backstage on Thursday.",
      "\"If we do really badly, we're just gonna keep coming back until we win.\"",
      "We'll remember, Remember Monday.",
      "See you in Vienna next year.",

      "It is the third time Austria has won the contest, with previous victories going to Udo J\u00fcrgens' Merci, Cherie in 1966; and Conchita Wurst with Rise Like a Phoenix in 2014. JJ was inspired to take part in Eurovision by Conchita.",
      "The singer had always been one of the favourites to win, but the most hotly-tipped contestants were Sweden's KAJ - whose tongue-in-cheek ode to sauna culture, Bara Bada Bastu, ultimately took fourth place.",

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution - all of which he has vehemently denied.",
      "Surrounded by his children and dozens of family and friends, Mr Combs has watched Ms Ventura from his chair at the defence table just a few dozen feet away.",
      "All the while, US District Judge Arun Subramanian has pushed attorneys to stay on schedule, as prosecutors have expressed worry their star witness could go into labour with her third child as soon as this weekend.",
      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",

      "Get all the latest trial updates on the BBC Sounds 'Diddy on Trial' podcast available wherever you get your BBC podcasts.",
      "Throughout Ms Ventura's harrowing story of domestic violence, prosecutors have tried to thread in elements of their larger sex trafficking and racketeering case against Mr Combs.",
      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Arick Fudali, a lawyer who represents an unnamed victim in the government's case against Mr Combs, said \"the fear of what would happen if they didn't comply\" is a crucial element of the government's case.",
      "\"Someone can consent to a sexual act of course,\" Mr Fudali told the BBC. \"But someone can also be coerced into being compliant, and that's different.\"",
      "The government has also used Ms Ventura's testimony to try to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.",
      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "summary": "Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.",
    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",
      "\"Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,\" he says.",
      "Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at \u00a314.99 a month.",
      "There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price.",
      "Game Pass players could pay a \u00a334.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content.",

      "But on Friday, resident Rebekah Shaman won a High Court challenge over the use of the site this summer, after arguing that the council did not have the correct planning permission for the events.",
      "A Lambeth Council spokesperson said: \"We are currently assessing the impact of this judgment and determining next steps.\"",
      "Michael Kill, chief executive of the NTIA, said cancelling the series of festivals \"would directly impact thousands of people... many of whom rely on the summer season to sustain their livelihoods\".",
      "\"The supply chain, from staging and lighting companies to local food and drink vendors, would suffer heavy financial losses,\" he said.",
      "\"The local economy - including independent shops, pubs, restaurants, and hotels - which sees a surge in business during these festivals, would be hit hard.\"",

      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Paige and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "\"You'll never guess what I did on Monday, I got married\", the 68-year-old said, adding: \"Don't be offended, we didn't invite anyone\".",
      "He confirmed that their only witness was their son Buzz, who was born in 2012, and that the marriage took place at Camden Town Hall.",
      "Skinner previously said during an interview with The Sun in 2024 that he had asked Mason to marry him four times, but she had always declined.",
      "\"Maybe it's some terrible personal reason that I don't know about,\" he said, \"that she doesn't actually like me as much as I think she does.",
      "\"Her parents got divorced, so she got a bit cynical about it and thinks if we get married it would be like a slight curse on the thing,\" he went on to add.",
      "Skinner, who met Mason when she was working for his management company, says their wedding was not a traditional one at her request.",
      "\"I don't want a load of guests, I'm not going in a church. I don't want a ring,\" he says she told him.",
      "He added: \"The thing that no one ever says about getting married is it's quite embarrassing. How can I put it? It's a bit basic getting married.\"",
      "Instead of a white dress, Skinner says \"she wore a flowery dress\" and they walked down the aisle to Lie Dream Of a Casino Soul by The Fall as the Manchester post-punk group \"meant so much to me and Cath when we were in our early days\".",
      "He says Mason also kept her own name and does not wear a ring now that they are married.",
      "Frank Skinner: \u2018I\u2019m all for a bit of moral menace\u2019",
      "When he was asked why they had decided now was the right time, he said: \"I don't know why. I just thought, \"Maybe I've got too much money, I'll give her half in about five years time!\" and denied that it was \"a tax thing\", adding \"I'm not planning on dying anytime soon\".",
      "Skinner, whose real name is Christopher Graham Collins, is probably best-known for writing the lyrics and singing on football song Three Lions, with David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds, and for his TV and radio work.",
      "He hosted The Frank Skinner Show on Absolute Radio from 2009 to 2024, before moving the format over to the podcast.",
      "He also hosted The Frank Skinner show for 10 years on ITV from 1995 to 2005 and Room 101 on the BBC between 2012 and 2018."

      "Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year.",
      "Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.",
      "The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Matar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman.",
      "He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault.",
      "The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday.",
      "Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press.",

      "\"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\"",
      "Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution.",

      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",

      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",

      "If it wasn't for Nemo, Switzerland wouldn't be hosting this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "Twelve months ago, the singer lifted the trophy for their song The Code, an operatic pop track about their journey to realising they were non-binary.",
      "It was the first victory for a non-binary performer in Eurovision history and the first for Switzerland since C\u00e9line Dion won in 1988.",
      "Looking back, 12 months later, the singer says the experience \"turned my life upside down, in the best way possible.\"",
      "\"The most important thing was [that] I gained a lot of self confidence in myself as an artist.",
      "\"It adds a level of relaxation to the creation process, because I know I can trust my gut when it comes to writing songs and performance.\"",
      "After last year's contest, Nemo was vocal in their criticism of the organisers who, they said, didn't do enough to support participants who were caught up in a row over Israel's inclusion.",
      "\"I felt very alone,\" they told BBC News last October, \"and I know that some other artists were also feeling that way.\".",
      "\"I really hope they have things in place for the next year to make sure that part of the whole contest, especially mentally, gets taken care of.\"",
      "Eurovision responded last December, by introducing a swathe of new rules designed to protect contestants' welfare.",
      "There are more closed-door rehearsals, allowing participants to refine their performances away from the critical eyes of fans and the media.",
      "And, after artists like Bambie Thug accused other countries of filming them backstage without permission, the contest introduced no-filming zones backstage.",
      "\"We all feel super safe in that area,\" French singer Louane told the BBC earlier this week.",
      "\"It means when you encounter a blue carpet, you're not allowed to have your phone out to film or take pictures or anything.\"",
      "The result is a much calmer atmosphere in the Eurovision camp. After the tensions of 2024, the class of 25 have even set up a WhatsApp group to cheer each other on.",
      "\"It's such a nice thing to have everybody so supporting each other,\" says Claude, who is representing the Netherlands.",
      "\"Like, if somebody forgot something in their home country, they'd just be like, 'Does somebody have like, a charger?' and the reply would come, 'Oh yes, you can come pick it up at my hotel room'. It's so fun!\"",

      "\"There's a lot of expectations,\" they explain.",
      "\"The media at home is like, 'Oh, we're not happy with this entry, it's going to fail.'",
      "\"Or they take the complete opposite [approach] of, 'This has to win. And if it's not winning, we're really disappointed.'",

      "\"I was like, 'It's gone right seven times. What are the chances that, in this moment, it will go wrong?'",
      "\"So I trusted in the moment, and everything went fine, but I could have been the biggest loser in the history of Switzerland!\"",
      "Instead, they topped the table and lifted the trophy... before promptly breaking it in two.",

      "The 25-year-old will return to the Eurovision stage on Saturday, performing their new single, Unexplainable.",
      "Fans who grew to love The Code - with its operatic high notes and propulsive drum and bass notes - might be surprised by the change in sound.",

      "\"I rarely understand my thoughts / I write them down before I sleep... What if I'm unexplainable?\"",
      "Nemo says the song poured out of them one night, as they grappled with a tendency to overanalyse their thoughts and feelings that leaves them \"feeling detached from my emotions\".",

      "Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.",
      "\"It's something I deal with every day,\" she told the BBC. \"It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.\"",
      "On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.",
      "She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.",
      "But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.",
      "Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. \"Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,\" she said.",

      "Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.",
      "That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. \"I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,\" she says. \"To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.\"",

      "The rules of the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 which is in charge of Eurovision \u2013 means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.",

Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.",
      "Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.",
      "More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.",
      "In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. \"Everybody has opinions,\" she said. \"I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.\"",
      "Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\".",

    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",

      "\"I'm not as hopeless as I was as a 21-year-old, that's for sure. Obviously, I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.\"",
      "Where do the Menendez brothers go from here?",
      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Weighing in on such a divisive case could be \"risky\", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.",
      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",
      "\"The question for the board is a rather simple one,\" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  \"Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.\"",
      "Mr Rand acknowledged the case is \"risky\" politically for Newsom.",
      "\"You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,\" Rand told the BBC. \"But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.\"",
      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",
      "They've also led productive lives while incarcerated, with Erik founding a hospice programme to help elderly and disabled inmates while Lyle has been working on prison beautification.",
      "Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family \u2013 from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.",

      "If the board recommends parole in June, the governor has 30 days to accept or reject the recommendation. If they are paroled, the brothers will be released likely within five months, according to the California Department of Corrections.",
      "The fact that Gov Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment before the brothers were even deemed eligible for parole has many thinking he's open to releasing them.",
      "\"He wants the political cover\" of the parole board and court recommendations, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who has been following the brothers' legal saga but is not representing any of the participants.",
      "A year ago, Mr Rahmani never would have predicted the Menendez brothers could be released. Now he thinks they will be free within the next few months.",
      "But it wouldn't be unprecedented for Gov Newsom to reject a high-profile parole recommendation.",
      "Several times he blocked the release of a Manson Family member. And in 2022, Newsom blocked the release of Sirhan Sirhan, the man who assassinated Sen Robert F Kennedy.",
      "As far as the Menendez brothers go, Gov Newsom said on his podcast that he's mulling over the case and he's not planning to watch any of the documentaries or true crime dramas about the case.",
      "\"I'm obviously familiar with the Menendez brothers just through the news over the course of many decades, but not to the degree that many others are because of all of these documentaries and all of the attention they've received,\" he said. \"So that won't bias my independent and objective review of the facts.\"",

    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave",

      "She suffers from panic attacks and her fear of driving means she is constantly cancelling plans.",
      "But, over the course of six sessions with psychotherapist Owen O'Kane, it becomes clear her problems are much deeper than just a fear of driving.",
      "Digging around in the mind",
      "Every week, one in six of the UK population experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and every year more than 1.2 million people seek help from the NHS talking therapies service, with many more paying for support privately.",
      "This form of therapy is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, but can also help with a range of other problems, including body image dysmorphia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. It does not work for everyone: research suggests one-third of people do not benefit.",
      "The BBC has followed 12 people, featured in the series Change Your Mind, Change Your Life, who each received six support sessions from therapists.",
      "The therapists have used a combination of different talking therapy approaches, including cognitive behavioural therapy which focuses on changing the way we think and behave, alongside other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma.",
      "What it reveals is striking: How understanding and learning to manage the mind has the power to transform lives.",
      "\"You're not stuck with the brain you've got,\" says Owen O'Kane, who has worked in the field for 25 years.",
      "He describes his job as like detective work: \"People come with what seems to be a reasonable story, but the interesting thing is that very often the story and emotions don't match. I guess what we are doing is digging around a little bit.\"",
      "'I completely hated myself'",
      "Over their sessions, Owen digs deeper into Nicole's anxiety. At one point she weeps. She admits in the past she has \"completely hated\" herself. She worries about what people think of her and is socially anxious: \"I don't feel good enough to be there. I might say something wrong. I need people to like me.\"",
      "Owen questions why she feels like this: \"As human beings we like the nice emotions. We like feeling happy, joy, being in love.\" but he says some people try to avoid or suppress emotions like fear, dread and sadness, and that can cause anxiety. Instead, he says it is healthier to accept them and accept them as safe.",
      "When people get to that point, he says, they start to feel empowered: \"They realise they're not going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "Speaking outside the therapy room, Nicole says: \"I'm shocked. He got my number straight away. I would see vulnerability as a negative thing, but it's not.\"",
      "Asked to describe herself she uses words such as kind, thoughtful, determined and enthusiastic: \"I am not a bad person,\" she tells Owen.",
      "She says she has learned a lot: \"Most importantly I found I wasn't being kind to myself. That was really eye-opening.\"",
      "Owen says this is typical of many people he treats: \"When people get to these crossroads, when they wake up and realise what they are doing, that's a gold dust moment for me.\"",

      "\"It made me feel a lesser man.\"",
      "Now he fears under-performing at work and losing his job.",
      "Over the course of the sessions, Prof Peters explains the key is James's belief system.",
      "First, he gives some seemingly simple advice: \"Put your feet on the floor, stand up and walk,\" he says.",
      "Focusing on the basic task of moving, in James's case moving so he can get to work, enables someone caught up in catastrophic thinking to block out the negative thoughts that stop them doing something.",
      "In later sessions, James and Prof Peters explore what could be behind his problems. James tells Prof Peters about his childhood and how his father would criticise him to push him to improve.",
      "Prof Peters explains how James believes that to please you cannot make errors and then the devastating stroke he suffered at a young age has triggered an absolute desire for things to never go wrong again.",
      "He tells James he needs to make \"peace with himself\" by defining himself not by performance but by values and behaviours. He too asks James to describe himself and James replies he is hard-working, honest, engaging, friendly and as someone who would put others first.",

      "When her mother died, Anjalee was in the middle of exams and had two younger siblings, leaving her without time to grieve.",
      "Julia suggests eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, which uses movement to help people process and recover from distressing events.",
      "Julia asks Anjalee for her worst memory and she describes how her father tried to save her mother's life by performing chest compressions in their home until the paramedics arrived. Her mother was rushed out with Anjalee hoping she would return. She never did.",

      "Julia says this type of treatment is particularly effective when dealing with one single traumatic event. One memory, she says, can act as a block on everything.",
      "Afterwards, Anjalee speaks about how her symptoms have eased and the contentment she now feels.",

      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",

      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",

      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",

      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",

      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",

      "In recent years, the deaths of Errol Graham, Philippa Day and Kevin Gale have seen the DWP widely criticized for its handling of vulnerable clients.",

      "Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "In Mr Gale's case, the coroner highlighted \"that current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms\".",
      "The inquest heard of the number and length of DWP forms that claimants were required to complete, the length of telephone queues for DWP advisers, and the requirement to travel long distances for appointments for people affected by mental health illness.",
      "Thursday's report, from the Work and Pensions Select Committee, reveals the deaths of at least 274 people have been investigated internally by the DWP in since April 2015.",
      "Such inquiries - Internal Process Reviews - are launched when there is an allegation that a case has been mishandled by the DWP which has potentially contributed to serious harm or a safeguarding concern.",
      "During the same period, 58 reviews were opened into cases where customers suffered harm - but the MPs said the scale of the failings was likely to be greater.",
      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",
      "\"We heard evidence that the process of engaging with the DWP... too often led to mental distress.",

      "\"Introducing a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants for the department is a fundamental part of this.\"",
      "A new law, holding the secretary of state accountable for safeguarding clients, would ensure that everyone saw it as their responsibility to protect claimants, says the committee.",
      "'Nasty and traumatic'",
      "Carl, 44, a former roofer from Croydon, south London, said his first interaction with the DWP \"felt quite a nasty and traumatic experience\".",
      "He had struggled for 18 months with a degenerative back condition that had left him with mobility issues and constant pain, requiring strong painkillers.",
      "In 2018, after trying a variety of less manual roles, such as plastering and carpet fitting, he realised he could no longer hold down a job.",
      "He applied for universal credit, his first ever benefit application, which led to an appointment at his local job centre.",
      "Carl says the work coach was \"very dismissive and patronising\".",

      "\"It almost felt like he was trying to imply that I was being dishonest and I was putting it on.",

      "'Absolutely life-changing'",
      "Shannon Johnstone, 28, who found herself sleeping rough about seven years ago before turning to the DWP for help, said the recommendations \"are going to be absolutely life-changing for people... if they're done right\".",
      "At the start of her claim, she remembers the DWP told her: \"We can't help with your homelessness,\" which she says was understandable but off-putting.",
      "She does not know if they referred her case to homeless organisations as she was never told. Now she welcomes the recommendation to include the views of people with lived experience in the design, planning and implementation of DWP policy.",
      "\"People who have gone through the system understand what it feels like to be interviewed by a [DWP] inspector,\" says Shannon who now works for the charity, Expert Link.",
      "\"They understand what it's like to gather lots of paperwork, so by including them in the design of the system, it's going to work so much better.\"",
      "In a statement, the DWP said the government was committed to protecting the people who use its services \"and fixing the broken welfare system we inherited so it works for those who need it\".",
      "\"That's why we are currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach and our reforms will improve people's lives and rebuild trust, by establishing an approach that genuinely supports vulnerable people.\"",

      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",

On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",

      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",

      "'A red line I would never cross'",
      "Dr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP.",
      "We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque.",

      "\"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me.",
      "\"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\"",
      "He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death.",
      "Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later.",
      "Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying?",

      "\"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\"",
      "By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice.",

      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",

      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",

      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care.

      "The former Conservative minister, who sat in the cabinet for most of the period between 2010 and 2024, told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that he didn't think another referendum was necessary.",
      "But he conceded that the UK government may have to change approach if SNP popularity and support for another vote grows.",

      "Michael Gove and SNP leader John Swinney do not have much in common politically, but they seem to be delivering a relatively similar message on this topic.",
      "Last week, the first minister talked about securing \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "Swinney compared this to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament, which was backed by around 74% of Scots.",
      "The message seemed to be that independence will move forward when public support demands it in greater numbers.",
      "But the first minister also told BBC Scotland News that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for the independence movement \"to be thwarted by a Westminster government that just folds its arms and says 'no'.\"",

      "Back in 2023, the UK government made the unprecedented decision to veto Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill.",

      "Gove chaired a committee of ministers who agreed to enact Section 35 of the Scotland Act.",
      "This allows a UK minister to veto a Holyrood bill if they think it would modify laws reserved to Westminster and have an \"adverse effect\" on how those laws apply.",
      "This power had never been used before and it has not been used since.",
      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the term 'woman' related to biological sex under the Equality Act.",

      "\"I think it was absolutely the right decision, and I think it's been vindicated by subsequent events\", he added.",

    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",
      "It specifically mentions social care workers and pharmacists as among those covered.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",
      "At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being \"distasteful and disrespectful\" for accusing the bill's opponents of having \"undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy\" their concerns.",
      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",
      "Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a \"burden\".",
      "Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first.",
      "She told the Commons this \"presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives\".",
      "But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said \"highly trained\" medical professionals must be trusted \"to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day\".",
      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die.",

    "summary": "The summit between the UK and EU on 19 May will be the first since Brexit - the very idea of it has polarised opinions",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

    "summary": "A cross-party committee says farmers have lost trust in the government over its policies.",
    "story": [
      "Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned.",
      "Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m at a rate of 20% \u2013 half the usual rate \u2013 saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget.",
      "In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without \"adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment\".",
      "The government said its inheritance tax reforms were \"vital\" and its commitment to farmers was \"steadfast\".",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "Efra's report said the tax reforms \"threaten to affect the most vulnerable\" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek \"appropriate professional advice\".",
      "National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay \"doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers\".",
      "He said the policy remained \"fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed\".",
      "The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme \"affected trust in the government\" and left many farmers \"at risk of becoming unviable\".",
      "When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it as another \"shattering blow\" to farmers.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure.",
      "But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that \"a restoration of trust is urgently required\".",
      "Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively.",
      "\"The government, however, seems to be dismissing farmers' concerns and ignoring the strength of feeling evidenced in the months of protests that saw tractors converge on Westminster and up and down the country,\" he added.",
      "The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its \"current disastrous policy\" on inheritance tax.",
      "It said the government should consider an alternative \"clawback\" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale.",
      "CLA president Victoria Vyvyan said the \"clawback\" proposal would limit the damage to family businesses while targeting \"those who have bought land to shelter wealth for short-term gain\".",
      "\"The government has dug itself into a deep hole by targeting family farms and businesses, and must now pause, listen and consult,\" she said.",
      "But a government spokesman said that under its changes three quarters of estates would continue to pay no inheritance tax at all, while\u202fthe remaining quarter would \"pay half the inheritance tax that most people pay\".",
      "He added that payments could be spread over 10 years, interest-free.",
      "Details of a new SFI scheme will be announced after the upcoming spending review.",

    "story": [
      "A few days on from seeking to sound muscular about his desire to squeeze legal migration, the prime minister is in Albania focusing on illegal arrivals.",
      "The Balkan country has provided a rare British success story in the incredibly difficult politics and diplomacy of attempting to cut illegal migration.",
      "In 2022, around 12,500 Albanians crossed the English Channel by small boat, but the number has since shrunk massively.",
      "The last government, and latterly this one, set up campaigns to put people off attempting the journey and far more migrants have been returned.",
      "UK in talks to send failed asylum seekers abroad",
      "Are fewer Albanian migrants coming to the UK?",
      "Sir Keir Starmer wanted to lean into this inherited success from the Conservatives, and sought to make a virtue of being the first British prime minister to make an official visit to the country.",
      "But he also wanted to talk up negotiations with a handful of unnamed European countries that might temporarily take failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all avenues to remain in the UK.",
      "Downing Street told reporters the move could stop failed asylum seekers stalling deportation \"using various tactics, whether it's losing their paperwork or using other tactics to frustrate their removal\".",
      "The PM's spokesman added it would ensure they also cannot make their removal harder \"by using tactics such as starting a family\".",
      "Rwanda comparison",
      "It is an interesting idea, which draws initial parallels with the last government's plan to send some migrants to Rwanda, but is different.",
      "The Conservatives wanted to send people to the African country immediately after their arrival in the UK, to lodge an asylum claim there or another \"safe\" country.",
      "They argued, given the numbers arriving on small boats, a radical policy shift was needed to put people off.",
      "Labour argued it was a vastly expensive waste of money, and scrapped the idea.",
      "Now they are talking up their own, narrower plan.",
      "But the curiosity is they chose to do just that while on a visit to a country that is not interested in hosting what are being called \"return hubs\".",
      "Awkward timing",
      "And we were to find that out rather bluntly, when no sooner than Sir Keir Starmer had made the case for the idea, the man stood next to him, his Albanian counterpart Edi Rama, said they wouldn't be doing any more deals than the one they already have with Italy, their neighbour over the Adriatic Sea.",
      "Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was \"never planned as part of the discussions.\"",
      "In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on.",
      "Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an \"embarrassment\".",
      "It is another episode that serves as a reminder of just how hard it is finding workable, practical, deliverable solutions to a massive and complex issue, which plenty in government acknowledge they simply have to get a grip of.",

    "summary": "Site owners can currently take 10% of a park home's value when the owner sells up, on top of rent.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to scrap a law forcing people who live in mobile homes to hand over 10% of the profits when they sell up to the site owner.",
      "The charge has been labelled  \"legal theft of equity\" by campaigner Sonia McColl, who represents an estimated 200,000 park homes residents across England.",
      "She said most of the residents are retired and are selling up to pay for care, whereas the site owners are \"making a profit on their profit\".",
      "Dame Sonia handed in a petition at 10 Downing Street on Thursday, which 37,000 people have now signed up.",
      "'I'm on edge all the time' - park home resident",
      "Park home residents living in sewage 'nightmare'",
      "The charge is levied by site owners on residents selling their park home, taking 10% of the home's value, and can be worth up to \u00a350,000 on top of annual rent and maintenance fees.",
      "Dame Sonia, who has earned an OBE for her campaigning work, has been fighting  for a change to the law for more than a decade and complained politicians \"keep kicking it into the long grass\" but she was hopeful the new cohort of MPs would \"make a tremendous difference\".",
      "Asked why the issue was so important to her, she said: \"Often people need to move into care homes and the loss of 10% of their equity curtails the amount they can afford and that falls back on the local council.",
      "\"At the end of the day a lot of people want to sell their homes and are either feeling trapped in their own homes or they're losing out.\"",
      "A Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government spokesperson said the government recognised longstanding concerns about this sector of the housing market.",
      "\"We recognise concerns raised by park home residents about the commission fee paid on the sale of homes, which is why we are reviewing this issue and will set out further details in due course,\" they added.",
      "MPs on the Park Homes All- Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) joined the campaigners at Downing Street to hear their stories.",
      "Joshua Reynolds, Liberal Democrat MP for Maidenhead, said park home residents were put in an unfair position compared to bricks and mortar home owners.",
      "\"I used to have a leasehold flat and when I sold it, all the money was our money, because it was our property and I don't think there should be a difference,\" he said.",
      "\"The argument put forward is the money is used for maintenance but actually that's what your site charges are for.\"",
      "Dr Ben Spencer, Conservative MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, said park home residents should be treated the same as leaseholders.",
      "\"Why should the park site owner benefit from work and investment in kitchens and bathrooms in park homes?\" he asked.",
      "\"They already get pitch funds and annual rent, so taking 10% when homes are sold is fundamentally unfair because the park owner doesn't do anything to have this stake in other people's property.\"",
      "Labour housing minister Matthew Pennycook was invited but did not attend, although he has previously met Dame Sonia at a Park Homes APPG event.",
      "The British Holidays and Home Parks Association (BHHPA) said the commission charge supports maintenance and helps to reduce rent.",
      "A spokesman said: \"Residential park businesses rely on commission as a vital source of revenue to support the upkeep of the park and to make continual improvements which are in the interests of everyone.",
      "\"The commission also helps to ensure that the initial purchase price of park homes and the annual pitch fees remain lower than they would otherwise be.\"",

      "UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and her Senedd leader Darren Millar have declined to rule out deals with Plaid Cymru and Reform after next year's election in Wales.",
      "On current projections, it is likely politicians of different parties will need to work together to form the next Welsh government, with a majority difficult to obtain.",
      "On the first day of his party's Welsh conference in Llangollen, Senedd Tory leader Darren Millar has said his party was willing to work with \"anybody\" to get Labour out of power.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, who has ruled out working Reform at a UK level, admitted it was a \"reality\" that post-election talks may need to happen but said the conversation was a \"distraction\".",
      "The Conservatives have been polling in fourth place behind Labour, Reform UK and Plaid Cymru ahead of the election in Wales next May and lost all their Welsh MPs at the last general election.",
      "Millar described his party, which has 16 seats in the Welsh Parliament, as a \"government in waiting\" while Badenoch called on members to \"fight back\" against Plaid Cymru and Reform.",

      "On BBC Radio Wales Breakfast Millar said: \"I'm prepared to work with anybody to get rid of this failing Labour government.",
      "Asked to clarify if that was his answer to working with Reform, he repeated the point: \"I will work with anybody to get rid of this dreadful Welsh Labour government. I'll say no more than that.\"",
      "Pushed on what his position was on working with Plaid Cymru, he made the same comment.",
      "'We're not here to talk about deals'",
      "In an interview with BBC Wales, Badenoch was asked if she wanted to fight Plaid Cymru and Reform or do a deal with them.",
      "She said: \"We're not here to talk about deals, we're here to talk about what we are going to do to fix Wales.",
      "\"Whenever politicians start talking about who they are going to do deals with or how they are going to get back into government, you can see they are not really thinking about what is going to deliver for the people of this country.",
      "\"And that's why Darren and I are 100% focused on Conservatives winning as many seats as possible.\"",
      "Asked again about deals with Reform or Plaid, Badenoch admitted it was a \"reality\" that conversations might take place \"but right now, that's not where we are\".",
      "She added: \"I'm very clear I'm not having this conversation because its a distraction.\"",
      "Nigel Farage has said that Reform UK would be willing to work with any other party to form a government in Wales.",

      "She said Labour had \"always been able to blame someone else\" in Wales and that Plaid Cymru and Reform were \"benefiting\" now Labour was in power in Westminster.",
      "\"It's the politics of identity they are playing and we need to fight back. Reform is not the answer, Labour is not the answer.",
      "\"All these other parties are a flavour of the same thing. They tell people what they think they want to hear because they're trying to help themselves.\"",
      "Badenoch said last year's election result was \"devastating\" and the local elections in England showed the party was \"not yet out of the woods\".",
      "She said Wales was \"where our fightback begins\".",
      "In her speech she said it was \"good to be back in Wales\" before saying it had been \"fantastic meeting so many people\" including \"MSPs\".",
      "Wales does not have any MSPs \u2013 politicians from Cardiff Bay are called Members of the Senedd (MSs).",
      "She later told BBC Wales it was a \"slip of the tongue\".",
      "Earlier, Millar told the conference that last year's general election defeat was \"very bruising\" and it was \"clear that we have got a lot of work to do  to rebuild trust\".",
      "He said his party was \"the only credible alternative to this clapped out, lacklustre Labour government that has run this country into the ground, has run out of ideas and has run out of steam\".",
      "He said \"a bad opinion poll\" did not discourage him, but \"motivates me. It makes me work harder\".",
      "He said the Tories were \"pro-freedom, pro-choice, pro-personal responsibility\".",
      "On Friday morning the party launched a number of policies including a promise to bring down waits for NHS treatment to no more than a year, and reinstating home economics to schools.",
      "Millar told Radio Wales Breakfast that the policies showed the Tories were \"a government in waiting\".",
      "The conference follows a row among party grassroots members, who say Tories who dislike devolution are effectively barred from being candidates for the next Senedd election.",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Kemi Badenoch did not want to talk about post election deals, but did not rule them out either.",
      "Both she and Darren Millar appear to accept that with the polls looking ominous, this is the party's best hope of being involved in government in Cardiff Bay.",
      "But while Millar was talking of the potential for deals as soon as he took over last December, Badenoch's reticence suggests she is aware of the wider ramifications.",
      "She has already ruled out a pact with Reform at Westminster level \u2013 they potentially represent an existential threat to the Tories, and a deal with Plaid Cymru might be a tough sell to members of the Conservative and Unionist Party.",
      "Her choice of language is interesting too: Senedd politicians have accepted deals as a fact of political life for the past quarter of a century.",
      "For a Westminster politician they are seen as a \"stitch-up\"."

      "French police have charged a taxi driver with stealing luggage and cash from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his wife Nicola Green.",
      "The driver allegedly sped off with the couple's luggage after a row over a fare for the 360-mile journey from Forli, in Italy, to the French ski resort of Flaine, in Haute-Savoie.",
      "The driver insisted he was owed 700 euros (\u00a3590) in cash for part of the journey not covered by an upfront payment to a booking service.",
      "But the Foreign Office said in a statement the fare had been paid in full before they set off on their private holiday.",

      "A member of the foreign secretary's office contacted the driver to get the luggage back, and it was allegedly deposited at a police station with a \"considerable\" sum of money missing from Ms Green's bag, thought to be equivalent to the amount the driver believed was owed to him.",

      "\"He has been charged with theft (of luggage and cash) to the detriment of Nicola Green and David Lindon Lammy.\"",
      "Mr Duffau later told the AFP news agency the driver had been \"placed under judicial supervision with a driving ban and a 2,000 euro (\u00a31,690) bail\".",
      "From a \"commercial dispute born of a misunderstanding, the tone certainly rose and, after investigation, the prosecutor's office deemed it appropriate to state that the taxi driver's version was not proven\", unlike that of the minister, added Mr Duffau.",

      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC there were no sensitive documents or laptops in the car and the foreign secretary had been travelling on his own personal passport, rather than a diplomatic one.",

      "Last year the Labour government implemented an early release scheme drawn up under the previous government, shortly after taking office.",

      "More than a thousand inmates will be released early to free up spaces in prisons in England and Wales, the justice secretary has announced, as the government grapples with an overcrowding crisis.",
      "Under the move, offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licences, will be released after 28 days.",
      "Shabana Mahmood said a \u00a34.7bn investment would fund more prisons, but said it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\".",
      "A senior Ministry of Justice (MoJ) official said the government would \"run out of prison places in just five months' time\" if action was not taken.",
      "Bold spending needed to halt prison crisis - union",
      "Ministers to consider scrapping short jail terms",
      "Plea for urgent action after prison officer attacks",
      "Last week, the prisons minister told the BBC there would be no more emergency releases to deal with the overcrowding crisis in prisons.",
      "But Mahmood said the move would free up about 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time to overhaul a system \"on the brink of collapse\".",
      "The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said.",
      "In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments.",
      "The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks.",
      "Mahmood warned that despite plans to start work on three prisons this year, it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\" and the government otherwise faced running out of spaces for male offenders by November.",
      "The latest prison-building initiative will be funded by a capital investment of \u00a34.7bn over the five years after 2026.",
      "Three prisons will be built, with work starting on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year, Mahmood added.",
      "A fourth prison, HMP Millsike near York, opened earlier this year.",
      "Changes from an upcoming review of sentencing, led by former Conservative minister David Gauke, were only likely to be felt from spring next year, she added.",
      "Amy Rees, the MoJ's interim permanent secretary, said that on the government's \"current trajectory\"  England would \"entirely run out of prison places for adult men, in November of this year.\"",
      "The number of recalled prisoners has increased in recent years and they now make up 13,583 inmates from a total prison population of 88,087.",
      "This is only 1,355 spaces short of the total useable operational capacity of 89,442.",
      "It is estimated to increase to between 95,700 and 105,200 by March 2029, according to government analysis released last year.",
      "The changes announced on Wednesday would apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released after serving their minimum period but recalled for breaching their terms of their licence, such as not sticking to their curfew.",
      "The scheme will not include those who have been sent back in for reoffending.",
      "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the announcement was \"failing to protect the public\".",
      "He said \"to govern is to choose, and today she's chosen to release early criminals who've reoffended or breached their licences.\"",
      "The chairman of the Prison Officers Association said building new prisons will \"not improve the current population crisis\".",
      "\"The government would be better off spending billions of taxpayers' money on modernising the prison estate, funding an under-resourced probation service, providing more secure mental health beds and ensuring we have robust community sentences that the public have confidence in,\" Mark Fairhurst said.",
      "One victim, whose perpetrator was recalled for breaching their restraining order, said the move was \"outrageous\" and meant some criminals would be given an easy way out without doing their time.",
      "Domestic Abuse Commissioner Dame Nicole Jacobs said the proposal lacked consideration for victims' safety and put lives in danger.",
      "\"You are not sent to prison for four years if you do not pose significant risk to your victim or the wider public,\" she said. \"Perpetrators of domestic abuse know everything about their victim \u2013 where they live, where they work, where their children go to school \u2013 they are also extremely willing to breach orders intended to protect victims, time and time again.",
      "\"Re-releasing them back into the community after 28 days is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "The announcement comes just weeks before Gauke's independent sentencing review will publish its proposals on how to deal with the overcrowding.",
      "It is understood it is likely to recommend more community based sentencing to reduce the reliance on imprisonment.",
      "Last summer, thousands of offenders were released early just days before prisons were expected to run out of places.",
      "According to government documents, between September and December 16,231 prisoners were released on licence under a scheme announced last year to let out offenders after serving 40% rather than 50% of their sentence.",
      "It applied to those serving more than five years and excluded those convicted of serious violence, sex crimes and terrorism.",

      "The prime minister said measures in the white paper, a blueprint for future laws, would make the system \"controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",
      "Lower qualification requirements will remain on a \"time limited basis\" for sectors deemed to be facing long-term recruitment issues.",
      "What this means in practice is not yet clear, with the government's migration advisory body tasked with recommending roles for inclusion.",

      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",

      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",
      "The government says it expects this to be passed on to international students in the form of higher fees, reducing applications by 7,000 per year.",
      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",

      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",

      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",

      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",

      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",

      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",

      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",

      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",

      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants - in multiple ways - to treat open wounds and other injuries.",
      "University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other.",
      "Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate.",
      "The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use \"forest first aid\".",
      "Researchers say the study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild.",
      "Chimpanzees \u2018self-medicate\u2019 with healing plantsWounded orangutan seen using plant as medicine",
      "Chimpanzees \u2018self-medicate\u2019 with healing plants",
      "Wounded orangutan seen using plant as medicine",
      "Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was \"a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene\".",
      "\"Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,\" she explained. \"The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.\"",
      "The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.",
      "They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, \"because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy\".",
      "Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.",
      "This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s \u2013 local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.",
      "There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs.",
      "There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.",
      "This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.",
      "Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.",
      "Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.",
      "\"The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,\" Dr Freymann told BBC News.",
      "\"If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.\"",
      "\"But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings.\""

    "story": [
      "Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.",
      "The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.",
      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",
      "He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.",
      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",
      "At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.",
      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",

      "It was given a \u00a3500m grant by the UK government and is now investing \u00a31.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027.",
      "This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site.",
      "The changes will have a dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gases from Wales.",
      "The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC.",
      "But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry.",
      "In its report, the CCC said there were \"important lessons to learn\", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared.",
      "\"The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,\" they argued.",
      "The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened \"early and collaborative\" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said.",
      "The Welsh government could have ensured \"the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure\", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind.",

      "Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
      "The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how each UK nation might achieve this.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35.",
      "The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990.",
      "Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live.",
      "The CCC has made 16 \"priority\" recommendations for immediate action.",
      "These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport.",

      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Secureworks.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",

Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",
      "\"So, I can tell my kids, look up there on the Moon,\" he says. \"Daddy's tyres are up there.\"",

      "The blast happened just before 11:00 local time (19:00 BST) less than a mile from downtown Palm Springs, near several businesses including the American Reproductive Centers (ARC). The clinic said no-one from the facility was harmed.",
      "The suspect in the blast has been identified as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus, according to sources familiar with the investigation who spoke to BBC's US partner CBS News.",
      "Witnesses told the BBC the blast was strong enough to shatter windows and badly damage a nearby building that housed the ARC.",
      "Michael Beaumier, a witness, said he was knocked off his bike by the blast. \"It was that big of an explosion and I could hear windows shattering all around me,\" he said.",
      "Rhino Williams, who was at his restaurant nearby, told the BBC he initially thought the explosion was a plane or helicopter crashing.",
      "He said he ran to the scene to see if he could help, finding a badly damaged building with walls blown out and the front axle of a car on fire in the car park.",
      "\"That's all that was left of it,\" Mr Williams said. He also saw an iPhone on a tripod still standing in the car park, as if it was set to film or stream the explosion.",
      "Mr Williams said he rushed through the building shouting for any injured people - but did not find any. A few minutes later first responders arrived.",
      "Nima Tabrizi, another witness, said he heard a \"big boom\", a large cloud of smoke and the front of the clinic \"completely blown out\".",
      "The FBI said in a Saturday briefing that it was a deliberate attack.",
      "\"This was an intentional act of terrorism. As our investigation will unfold we will determine if it's international terrorism or domestic terrorism,\" said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.",
      "The FBI later said it had \"a person of interest\" in its investigation, but officers were \"not actively searching\" for the suspect.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS that the Bartkus, the suspect, is a resident of Twentynine Palms, home to a large marine base about an hour away from Palm Springs.",
      "They added that he had stated in writings and recordings that he is opposed to increasing the population and is against in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - a service offered by clinic that was targeted - saying it is \"extremely wrong\".",
      "The blast was a result of a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, the sources said. It was felt more than a mile away from the explosion.",
      "Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills said the blast damaged several buildings, some severely.",
      "He added that the identity of the person who was killed was not known.",
      "The ARC in Palm Springs said the explosion occurred in the car park near its building.",
      "The fertility clinic said their lab, including all eggs and embryos, remained \"fully secure and undamaged\".",
      "\"We are heavily conducting a complete safety inspection and have confirmed that our operations and sensitive medical areas were not impacted by the blast,\" the clinic said in its statement.",
      "But Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told the Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged.",
      "\"I really have no clue what happened,\" he said. \"Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.\"",
      "According to its website, the ARC clinic is the first full-service fertility centre and IVF lab in the Coachella Valley.",
      "It offers services including fertility evaluations, IVF, egg donation and freezing, reproductive support for same-sex couples and surrogacy.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights responded to the incident, calling the attack \"unconscionable\".",
      "\"The history of violence against reproductive health centers is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe,\" the legal advocacy group said in a statement, adding that it is concerned about \"the heated political debate around fertility treatments\" in the US.",
      "Lawmakers, advocates and medical professionals have clashed over issues of access and regulation of reproductive rights in recent years, making it an election issue in 2024. IVF is broadly popular in the US across the political spectrum, but some far right circles are vocally opposed to assisted reproductive technologies on religious or moral grounds.",
      "California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state was co-ordinating with local and federal authorities, while US Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had been briefed on the incident."

    "summary": "The famous Boeing 747 which has been part of the fabric of US history for decades could soon be supplied by Qatar.",
    "story": [
      "Most journalists travelling with the US president don't see much of the interior of Air Force One, the presidential jet.",
      "The press cabin is in the back of the plane, accessible by a rear set of steps and a quick turn of a corner.",
      "To reach the presidential suite at the front of the plane would require negotiating with the armed Secret Service agents in the next-door cabin.",
      "On Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, when the future of the famous plane was a huge talking point, Fox News host Sean Hannity had priority seating and access to the president to conduct an in-flight interview.",
      "But the rest of us in the travelling press pool were consigned to our small section of the plane.",
      "It was a whirlwind trip, hitting three nations in three nights, half a world away. The president described it as an \"endurance test\" - one that his staff and those of us in the press pool had to manage, as well.",
      "The presidential jet is not a bad way to fly, however. The 14 seats are comfortable, roughly on par with a first-class domestic flight.",
      "There's a bathroom and a table with snacks (including the coveted Air Force One-branded M&Ms bearing the president's signature, which aren't available anywhere else).",
      "Qatar's Air Force One offer angers Trump supportersIs Trump allowed to accept 747 gift?",
      "Qatar's Air Force One offer angers Trump supporters",
      "Is Trump allowed to accept 747 gift?",
      "The cabin has a pair of television monitors - usually tuned to the president's preferred cable news channel (CNN during Joe Biden's term; Fox News for Trump). On occasion, they've been set to a football game or other sporting events.",
      "For longer flights, the on-board kitchen serves plated meals (the president eats from a different, fancier menu). On short hops, there's usually food in a takeaway bag.",
      "But the interior of this famous aircraft could soon undergo a radical refit if, as looks likely, Trump accepts the Qatari offer to supply a new \"palace in the sky\" - the biggest foreign gift ever received by a US president.",
      "Technically, \"Air Force One\" is a radio call sign, the designation for any Air Force aircraft with the US president aboard. The small prop plane Lyndon Baines Johnson took from Austin to his Texas ranch in the 1960s was Air Force One, too.",
      "But the Air Force One most people picture, the one featured in the Harrison Ford action film, is the Boeing 747-200b with water blue, steel blue and white paint set against a chrome underbody - a colour scheme picked out by First Lady Jackie Kennedy in 1962.",
      "Currently there are two of these 747s in the Air Force passenger fleet, in use since 1990. Needless to say, technology \u2013 both in aircraft design and everything else \u2013 has come a long way in the ensuing years. The planes have been upgraded, but the costs of maintaining the airframe and engines are growing. The aircraft are showing their age.",
      "This has clearly irked the current White House occupant \u2013 the only president to own his own jet, or for that matter, his own airline, prior to taking office.",
      "\"I leave now and get onto a 42-year-old Boeing,\" he said, exaggerating the plane's age during an industry briefing on Thursday in Abu Dhabi. \"But new ones are coming.\"",
      "Coming, but not soon enough for Trump. During his first term, he touted an updated presidential aircraft, made by Boeing, that was in the works. He even picked out his own colour palette, scrapping Kennedy's design for a red-white-and-blue livery. He proudly displays a model of that jet in the Oval Office.",
      "Originally planned to be delivered by 2021, delays and cost overruns for the estimated $4bn construction programme have made it less likely that the two new planes on order will be available for much, if any, of Trump's second term in office, which expires in January 2029.",
      "He has tasked tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk with speeding up the process and reportedly groused in private that he is embarrassed to travel in such an outdated plane.",
      "That explains why the president has become enamoured with the prospect of a seemingly more immediate solution to his air transport woes \u2013 courtesy of the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar.",
      "News of Qatar's offer of a lavish $400m (\u00a3301m) 747-8 made headlines last week, but the gift apparently has been in the works for months.",
      "Trump surreptitiously visited the aircraft in question in mid-February, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office.",
      "Aside from the legal and ethical concerns of such a substantial gift \u2013 raised by critics and some allies of the president - converting a foreign 747 for use by an American president creates a number of technical challenges.",
      "The aircraft would have to be made capable of in-flight refuelling and retrofitted with a sophisticated package of communications and security equipment. The current models have systems built to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion.",
      "Such a refitting process, says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, would take years, until 2030 at least.",
      "\"They have to assume the jet has been left unattended in a dangerous place for 13 years,\" he says. \"Which means it's not enough to take the plane apart. You also have to take every single component apart.\"",
      "The plane would need additional power to run its new systems, and its interior might have to be rearranged. Chances are there's no press cabin in the flying palace as originally designed.",
      "Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (\u00a3750m).",
      "He adds, however, that Trump could waive some, or all, of the security modifications if he so chooses.",
      "\"He's the president,\" he said.",
      "When the Air Force ultimately does retire its current crop of 747s, it will put to pasture an aircraft that have been part of fabric of American history for decades. One that transported President Bill Clinton, along with former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, to Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995.",
      "After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, George W Bush took to the skies in Air Force One and stayed aloft for hours, refuelling mid-air, until his security team determined it was safe for him to land and address the nation, before ultimately returning to Washington.",
      "Six US presidents have travelled on these jets, criss-crossing the US and visiting all corners of the globe. One took Biden to Israel just days after the 7 October attack by Hamas.",
      "Trump has effectively employed the aircraft as a campaign device, holding political rallies at airfields and making low-speed passes over the crowds before landing and using Air Force One as a dramatic backdrop for his speeches.",
      "On Trump's recent Mid East trip, military fighters from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE accompanied Air Force One as it flew through their national airspace.",
      "Aging though it may be, Air Force One is still one of the most recognisable signs of American presidential authority and power in the world - a military aircraft that serves a higher purpose.",
      "\"It's not made for luxury,\" says Aboulafia. \"It's a flying command post. You're not there to throw parties.\"",

      "A joint declaration that addresses the worrying geopolitical situation and emphasises UK-EU shared foreign policy priorities - such as supporting Ukraine, keeping up pressure on Russia, and ending civilian suffering in GazaAn EU-UK security and defence pactA package of measures targeted at removing some trade barriers between the EU and UK that have come about because of Brexit",
      "A joint declaration that addresses the worrying geopolitical situation and emphasises UK-EU shared foreign policy priorities - such as supporting Ukraine, keeping up pressure on Russia, and ending civilian suffering in Gaza",
      "An EU-UK security and defence pact",
      "A package of measures targeted at removing some trade barriers between the EU and UK that have come about because of Brexit",
      "Closer economic ties to Europe",
      "These trade measures are the \"reset\" of relations with the EU that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised since his party won a general election last summer.",
      "They are far from an economic gamechanger for the UK, though. Hardly what you'd call ambitious.",
      "Destroying all trade barriers with the EU is impossible if the Labour government keeps to its own \"red lines\" of not rejoining the bloc's customs union or single market.",
      "Despite promising to prioritise UK economic growth, and polls suggesting the majority of Britons want to do more trade with the EU, Labour will feel hemmed in by the increasingly popular, Eurosceptic Reform Party.",
      "It performed well in recent local elections in the UK.",
      "While some in Labour (quietly) admit they are tempted by a customs union with the EU to boost growth, any economic benefits would likely not be apparent to voters before the next UK election.",
      "Party members fear they would risk being punished at the polls, amidst accusations by the opposition Conservatives and Reform that the government would have betrayed Brexit.",
      "These concerns make the Starmer government \"more cautious, less bold\", says Mr Menon.",
      "So what will be agreed at the summit?",
      "The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach to try to reduce costly trade barriers with the EU.",
      "Many EU-UK negotiating hours have gone into agreeing a plant and animal health deal, known as an SPS agreement.",
      "This will facilitate the export and import of meat and plant products between the EU and UK and help reduce post-Brexit trade complications between Northern Ireland and Britain.",
      "In exchange, the EU insists the UK must agree to following any new SPS rules introduced in the future and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in policing the agreement.",
      "Those conditions will likely be unpopular with ardent Brexit supporters.",
      "They might also put backs up in Washington and complicate the UK doing a wider future deal on agriculture with the US, as the UK would be tied to stringent EU standards.",
      "But the Labour government knows public opinion polls suggest most people in the UK prioritise trade with the EU over the US.",
      "Currently the EU counts for 41% of UK exports; the US for 21%.",
      "The UK government will probably insist the SPS agreement is good for the British economy. Though animal and plant exports and imports are, in fact, a small part of overall GDP.",
      "In reality \"growth is a bit of a red herring here\", says Mr Menon.",
      "On the EU side, the French, backed by other fishing nations like the Netherlands and Denmark, have taken a tough stance in these talks - refusing to sign up unless the UK agrees to long-term EU fishing rights in UK waters.",
      "The current post-Brexit fishing agreement expires next year.",
      "Free-er movement for some",
      "The reset we'll hear about at Monday's summit will also include a \"mobility\" section.",
      "Starmer will get his ask, for the EU to recognise UK professional qualifications, to encourage cross-border business.",
      "There will also be a reduction in visa restrictions for UK musicians travelling and performing in the EU.",
      "In exchange, the EU - and Germany, most passionately - wants a youth mobility scheme, allowing young EU citizens to travel, study, and even work in the UK.",
      "The UK has similar schemes with Canada, Australia, South Korea and Japan, amongst others. But this has been tricky to agree.",

      "Some areas of negotiation are more advanced than others. This will be reflected in Monday's announcement.",
      "There will also be talk at the summit of plans to tackle illegal migration, cooperate on carbon border taxes, and simplify energy trading between the EU and UK.",
      "Reducing EU-UK trade barriers on chemicals and pharmaceutical goods is also a UK ambition, as is getting access to EU databases, like the Schengen Information System, to better track down criminals.",
      "But for now, at least, the EU is saying no to that. If it makes an exception for the UK, other non-EU countries will demand the same, it insists.",
      "Of course, it's in the interest of both sides to fight cross-border crime. The UK argues the current state of the world calls for more flexible thinking from Brussels.",
      "Defence and security complications",
      "The case for more flexible thinking is also something the UK is calling for when it comes to Monday's defence and security pact with the EU.",
      "The EU and UK already work closely together on Russian sanctions and defending Ukraine. And the pact isn't a legally binding document, so how complicated can these talks be, you may ask?",
      "The answer is pretty complicated.",
      "The UK wants its defence companies to be allowed to bid for contracts under the EU's new re-armament scheme, SAFE (Security Action for Europe).",
      "\"The UK has earned the right to access such a deal because of the leadership it's shown over Ukraine,\" says international defence expert Sophia Gaston, a visiting fellow at King's College London.",
      "\"Britain is a serious player both in traditional defence capabilities, like producing munitions, and in cutting edge defence innovation, where new growth and energy is.",
      "\"If the UK has access to the emerging EU defence programmes, it can contribute to mass and pace. [The war in Ukraine] has shown that both are needed.\"",
      "But Ms Gaston admits, UK companies getting the go-ahead from Brussels is a \"messy\" process.",
      "\"Re-Arm EU\", as Brussels dubs its new drive, is still a work in progress, spurred by rapidly changing geopolitics, including fears the US will withdraw at least some of the crucial security support Europe has relied on since World War Two.",
      "This is not yet a fully formed EU strategy that the UK can \"pay to play\" a part in, as it has done post-Brexit with the EU's research and innovation scheme Horizon, for example.",

      "If the EU is spending its taxpayers' money on defence, it argues it should be spent with EU companies to help boost EU economies.",
      "Paris also says, in this rapidly changing world of shifting alliances and allegiances, the EU should be self-reliant, not dependent on suppliers outside the bloc.",
      "Sceptics suspect France, which has a sophisticated defence industry, of wanting to hoover up lucrative EU contracts for itself.",
      "But it looks like it is losing the internal EU argument, with the Nordics, the Baltics, Poland, Italy and the Netherlands favouring more openness on defence contracts, and particularly with the EU's biggest economic power, Germany, championing the UK.",
      "\"Germany and France have very different attitudes towards the UK,\" says German economist Armin Steinbach from think tank Bruegel.",
      "Germany will always put relations with EU heavyweights France and Poland first, says Mr Steinbach.",
      "But he believes the UK will be helped in defence and economic negotiations with the EU by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who argues \"a unified Europe is the absolute priority in the current geopolitical setting\".",
      "Huge challenge of defence cooperation",
      "A priority maybe, but it's still a hugely tall order because it's all about compromise.",
      "Political leaders will seek to justify increases in defence spending by insisting to voters that it's for their personal security and in the interest of their national economy, with boosts in revenue for domestic defence industries.",
      "But achieving a pan-European industrial base - built to be efficient, avoid duplication, and to replace much of the US capacity relied on by the continent today - would mean some European countries winning more defence contracts than others.",
      "It would also mean some national businesses shutting down, in favour of better-suited ones elsewhere on the continent.",
      "That's a hard sell for political leaders facing their voters.",
      "As is another big trade-off: Big increases in defence spending will mean governments have less money to spend on public services.",
      "The challenge for Europe is breathtaking. By comparison, Monday's symbolic EU-UK summit, may seem like a walk in the park.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 May 2025 23:16:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Matthew Radalj tells the BBC of his time in a Beijing prison, revealing what goes on behind bars.",
    "story": [
      "Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison \u2013 a facility used for international inmates.",
      "Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture.",
      "The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was.",
      "Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on.",
      "The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "A harsh introduction",
      "\"I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,\" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020.",
      "The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen.",
      "He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration.",
      "Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.",
      "Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal \"transition phase\".",
      "During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions.",
      "\"We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.\"",
      "Eventually he was admitted to the \"normal\" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off.",
      "You also ate in the same room, he said.",
      "According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.",
      "The 'good behaviour' points system",
      "Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.",
      "One of these was the \"good behaviour points system\" which was a way \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 to reduce your sentence.",
      "Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time.",
      "If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work.",
      "Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation.",
      "He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.",
      "These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking \"incorrectly\" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.",
      "Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits.",
      "Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions.",
      "\"There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,\" he said. \"If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell.",
      "\"There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.\"",
      "One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence.",
      "Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system.",
      "So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure.",
      "These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.",
      "Food As Control",
      "But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food.",
      "The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat.",
      "They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added.",
      "Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition \u2013 and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week \u2013 that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou.",
      "Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their \"accounts\": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste.",
      "They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this \"privilege\" could be taken away.",
      "Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "To make things worse, they were made to work on a \"farm\", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them.",
      "Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was.",
      "But, he said, it was all for show.",
      "\"We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then \u2013 at the end of the season \u2013 they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,\" he added.",
      "\"And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.\"",
      "Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison.",
      "Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: \"The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.\"",
      "Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue.",
      "The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and \"were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas\", he said.",
      "Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items.",
      "This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner.",
      "Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem.",
      "His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year.",
      "\"You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do\u2026 So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big.",
      "\"After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.\"",
      "Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: \"It's none of your business.\"",
      "'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
      "Aboard the 'silver trains', China's retirees do their bit to offset Trump's tariffs",
      "The small-town mayor accused of trafficking and spying for China",
      "Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake \"propaganda\" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there.",
      "He said, at one point, a \"computer suite\" was set up. \"They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.\"",
      "The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just \"pretend\".",
      "\"Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,\" Radalj said.",
      "But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.",
      "The memoirs",
      "Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released.",
      "\"I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller\u2026 smaller!'.\"",
      "Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail.",
      "Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked.",
      "So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families.",
      "\"I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.\"",
      "He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing.",
      "But he couldn't keep it down.",
      "The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, \"Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?\"",
      "So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead.",
      "When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest.",
      "There was a tear in the lining of his jacket and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him.",
      "Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left.",
      "\"Did you forget something?\" the guards asked.",
      "\"They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.\"",
      "But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside.",
      "\"They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.\"",
      "The notes were still there.",
      "Life After Prison",
      "Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates.",
      "\"He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'\".",
      "The officer laughed.",
      "He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing.",
      "Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products.",
      "Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly.",
      "But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends \u2013 \"I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.\"",
      "Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life.",
      "\"With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,\" Radalj says. \"You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison.\""

    "summary": "The BBC visits families in Kashmir devastated by the deadliest clashes in years, and speaks to military insiders.",
    "story": [
      "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.",
      "When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.",
      "A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.",
      "\"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\"",
      "\"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\"",
      "Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.",
      "The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.",
      "What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.",
      "Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.",
      "In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.",
      "\"The strikes\u2026 were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\"",
      "But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.",
      "\"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.",
      "Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.",
      "\"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.",
      "But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\"",
      "It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.",
      "A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.",
      "India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.",
      "But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.",
      "\"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said.",
      "Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.",
      "\"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood\u2026 We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.",
      "Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\"",
      "Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.",
      "\"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\"",
      "After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in\u2026 power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.",
      "\"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\"",
      "On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\".",
      "This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\".",
      "By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.",
      "Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.",
      "The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.",
      "\"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.",
      "\"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\"",
      "One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.",
      "\"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.",
      "Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.",
      "Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.",
      "He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.",
      "\"Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.",
      "\"A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.\"",
      "Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.",
      "\"We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.\"",
      "As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.",
      "India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.",
      "\"This was a red line crossed,\" said one Pakistani officer. \"The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it\u2026 For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.\"",
      "Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.",
      "\"It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.\"",
      "On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the \"cross-border terrorist attack\" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.",
      "Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.",
      "\"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.",
      "\"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.",
      "India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.",
      "Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.",
      "\"We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,\" the Indian government source believes.",
      "In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.",
      "Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.",

      "\"The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town\u2026 Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ed21xyyro",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:35:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",
      "\"The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,\" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.",
      "\"I'm not as hopeless as I was as a 21-year-old, that's for sure. Obviously, I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.\"",
      "Where do the Menendez brothers go from here?",
      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Weighing in on such a divisive case could be \"risky\", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.",
      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",
      "\"The question for the board is a rather simple one,\" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  \"Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.\"",
      "Mr Rand acknowledged the case is \"risky\" politically for Newsom.",
      "\"You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,\" Rand told the BBC. \"But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.\"",
      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",
      "They've also led productive lives while incarcerated, with Erik founding a hospice programme to help elderly and disabled inmates while Lyle has been working on prison beautification.",
      "Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family \u2013 from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.",
      "\"They chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service,\" their cousin Anamaria Baralt said outside the court after they were resentenced.",
      "If the board recommends parole in June, the governor has 30 days to accept or reject the recommendation. If they are paroled, the brothers will be released likely within five months, according to the California Department of Corrections.",
      "The fact that Gov Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment before the brothers were even deemed eligible for parole has many thinking he's open to releasing them.",
      "\"He wants the political cover\" of the parole board and court recommendations, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who has been following the brothers' legal saga but is not representing any of the participants.",
      "A year ago, Mr Rahmani never would have predicted the Menendez brothers could be released. Now he thinks they will be free within the next few months.",
      "But it wouldn't be unprecedented for Gov Newsom to reject a high-profile parole recommendation.",
      "Several times he blocked the release of a Manson Family member. And in 2022, Newsom blocked the release of Sirhan Sirhan, the man who assassinated Sen Robert F Kennedy.",
      "As far as the Menendez brothers go, Gov Newsom said on his podcast that he's mulling over the case and he's not planning to watch any of the documentaries or true crime dramas about the case.",
      "\"I'm obviously familiar with the Menendez brothers just through the news over the course of many decades, but not to the degree that many others are because of all of these documentaries and all of the attention they've received,\" he said. \"So that won't bias my independent and objective review of the facts.\"",

    "summary": "PK Rosy, the first actress in Malayalam cinema, was hounded out of her home after playing the role of an upper caste woman.",
    "story": [
      "At a time when women's participation in the film industry was frowned upon, a young woman dared to dream differently.",
      "In 1920s pre-independence India, PK Rosy became the first female lead in Malayalam-language cinema, in what is now the southern state of Kerala.",
      "She starred in a movie called Vigathakumaran, or The Lost Child, in the 1920s. But instead of being remembered as a pioneer, her story was buried - erased by caste discrimination and social backlash.",
      "Rosy belonged to a lower-caste community and faced intense criticism for portraying an upper-caste woman in Vigathakumaran.",
      "Almost a hundred years later, there is no surviving evidence of Rosy's role. The film's reel was destroyed and the cast and crew have all died.",
      "Only a few pictures of the film from a contested press release dated October 1930 survive, along with an unverified black-and-white photo popularised by local newspapers as Rosy's only portrait.",
      "Even a Google Doodle celebrating her 120th birthday used an illustration similar to the woman in the photograph. But Rosy's nephew and others who have researched her life told the BBC that they could not conclusively say that it is her in the picture.",
      "PK Rosy was born as Rajamma in the early 1900s in the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, now Kerala.",
      "She belonged to a family of grass cutters from the Pulaya community, part of the Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's harsh caste hierarchy and have been historically oppressed.",
      "\"People from the Pulaya community were considered slave labour and auctioned off with land,\" says Malavika Binny, a professor of history at Kannur University.",
      "\"They were considered the 'lowliest'. They were flogged, raped, tied to trees and set on fire for any so-called transgressions,\" she adds.",
      "Despite the dire social challenges, Rosy chose to dream differently.",
      "She was supported by her uncle, who was a theatre artist himself, and with his help Rosy entered the field of entertainment.",
      "\"There are few available facts about Rosy's life, but it is known that she was popular for her performances in local plays,\" says Vinu Abraham, the author of The Lost Heroine, a novel based on Rosy's life.",
      "While her acting skills earned admiration, it was rare for a Dalit woman to take up acting at the time.",
      "\"She was likely aware of the fact that this was a new arena and making herself visible was important,\" says Prof Binny.",
      "She soon became a well-known figure in local theatre circles and her talent caught the eye of director JC Daniel, who was then searching for a lead actor for his film - a character named Sarojini.",
      "Daniel was aware of Rosy's caste identity and chose to cast her in the role.",
      "\"She was paid five rupees a day for 10 days of filming,\" said Mr Abraham. \"This was a substantial amount of money in the 1920s.\"",
      "On the day of the film's premiere, Rosy and her family were barred from attending the screening.",
      "They were stopped because they were Dalits, Rosy's nephew Biju Govindan says.",
      "And so began a chain of events that pushed Rosy out of the public eye and her home.",
      "\"The crowd that came to watch the movie were provoked by two things: Rosy playing an upper-caste woman and the hero picking a flower from her hair and kissing it in one scene,\" said Mr Abraham.",
      "\"They started throwing rocks at the screen and chased Daniel away,\" he added.",
      "There are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the theatre but what is clear is the toll the incident took on both Rosy and Daniel.",
      "Daniel had spent a lot of money to establish a studio and gather resources to produce the film, and was heavily debt-ridden. Facing immense social and financial pressure, the director, who is now widely regarded as the father of Malayalam cinema, never made another film.",
      "Rosy fled her hometown after an angry mob set her house on fire.",
      "She cut all ties with her family to avoid being recognised and never spoke publicly about her past. She rebuilt her life by marrying an upper-caste man and took the name Rajammal.",
      "She lived the rest of her life in obscurity in the town of Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, Mr Abraham says.",
      "Her children refused to accept that PK Rosy, the Dalit actor, was their mother, Rosy's nephew Mr Govindan says.",
      "\"Her children were born with an upper-caste Kesavan Pillai's identity. They chose their father's seed over their mother's womb,\" he says.",
      "\"We, her family, are part of PK Rosy's Dalit identity before the film's release,\" he said.",
      "\"In the space they inhabit, caste restricts them from accepting their Dalit heritage. That is their reality and our family has no place in it.\"",
      "In 2013, a Malayalam TV channel tracked down Rosy's daughter Padma, who was living in financial strain somewhere in Tamil Nadu. She told them that she did not know much about her mother's life before her marriage but that she did not act after that.",
      "The BBC made attempts to contact Rosy's children, but their relatives said they were not comfortable with the attention.",
      "Prof Binny says that the erasure of Rosy's legacy shows how deeply caste-based trauma can run.",
      "\"It can be so intense that it shapes or defines the rest of one's life,\" she says, adding that she is glad Rosy eventually found a safe space.",
      "In recent years, Dalit filmmakers and activists have sought to reclaim Rosy's legacy. Influential Tamil director Pa Ranjith has launched a yearly film festival in her name which celebrates Dalit cinema. A film society and foundation have also been established.",
      "But there is still a haunting sense that while Rosy was ultimately saved, it was at the cost of her passion and identity.",
      "\"Rosy prioritised survival over art and, as a result, never tried to speak publicly or reclaim her lost identity. That's not her failure - it's society's,\" says Mr Govindan.",

    "summary": "After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'.",
    "story": [
      "\"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something.",
      "For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage.",
      "He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan...",
      "The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue.",
      "\"Just, wow!\" remarked one London-based ambassador. \"It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.\"",
      "So what is going on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events?",
      "Pomp and flattery in Saudi",
      "A good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted \"commerce not chaos\" in the Middle East, a region that \"exports technology not terrorism\".",
      "His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace.",
      "As he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US.",
      "This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs.",
      "Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance.",
      "A 'none of our business' approach",
      "Absent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance.",
      "Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called \"the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons\" for \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\".",
      "To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these \"Western interventionists\" had \"wrecked more nations than they built\", adding: \"Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins.",
      "\"I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.\"",
      "That reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved.",
      "Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was \"fundamentally none of our business\u2026 We can't control these countries\".",
      "In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries.",
      "When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce.",
      "Pros of policy in one man's hands",
      "The centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas.",
      "Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia.",
      "It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government.",
      "Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters.",
      "Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive.",
      "This is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind).",
      "Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences.",
      "So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory.",
      "Limitations of his 'art of a deal'",
      "The problem is that this \"art of a deal\" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war.",
      "Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point.",
      "Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.",
      "This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier.",
      "\"Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,\" he wrote on social media. \"I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\"",
      "Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person.",
      "This puzzles some diplomats. \"Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?\" one remarked to me. \"Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?\"",
      "A snub to Netanyahu?",
      "Into this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war.",
      "Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated.",
      "What unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport.",
      "Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza?",
      "Capitalism to overcome conflict",
      "So after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear.",
      "For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims \u2013 the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant.",
      "For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability.",
      "We do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks \u2013 in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent \u2013 so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China.",
      "But that may prove an elusive ambition.\u202fIf there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.",
      "Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are'",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues next week in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband and brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",
      "The highly anticipated trial is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. For the first week, court will be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.",

    "story": [
      "At the\u00a0sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified for multiple days. Her testimony was completed on Friday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",

    "story": [
      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to \"keep his mouth shut\" until returning to the U.S.",
      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",
      "In a\u00a02016 interview\u00a0with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a \"moron.\" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic he didn't know \"if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"",

    "story": [
      "Singer Chris Brown was arrested Thursday in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",
      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",
      "Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary \"Chris Brown: A History of Violence.\"",
      "The singer is launching an international tour next month with artists Jhene Aiko, Summer Walker and Bryson Tiller, opening with a European leg before starting North America shows in July.",

      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand for four-and-a-half hours Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had \"tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,\" and \"wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.'

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",

      "Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \"underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress.\"",
      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",

      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",

      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",

Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \"EAT THE TARIFFS,\" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\"",
      "A spokesperson for Walmart told CBS News on Saturday that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and \"we won't stop.\"",
      "\"We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The threat by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Mr. Trump's wrath. Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.",
      "In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.",
      "Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said he thinks $350 car seats made in China will soon cost an additional $100, a 29% price increase.",
      "\"We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,\" he told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first-quarter sales.",
      "Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of tariffs, as consumers curtail spending.",
      "The administration recently ratcheted down its 145% tariffs on China to 30% for a 90-day period. Trump has placed tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada due to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, harming the relationship with America's two largest trading partners.",
      "There is a universal baseline tariff of 10% for most countries as Trump promises to reach trade deals in the coming weeks, all while insisting he intends to preserve the tariffs as a revenue source. The framework agreement with the United Kingdom would largely keep the 10% tariff rate in place.",
      "Trump has also placed import taxes on autos, steel and aluminum and plans to do so on pharmaceutical drugs, among other products.",

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "Shopper Elizabeth Giovanni also submitted several complaints to her local Kroger store in Millington, Tennessee. In one case, she said an entire dairy case with cheese had expired signs.",
      "\"I've recently stopped shopping there because of their lack of accountability and willingness to change the prices when they're in the wrong,\" she said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",

    "story": [
      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",

      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 13:17:34 -0400",
    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",
      "\"Families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems,\" he said.",

Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30%, a sign Americans are worried about the economy and their financial prospects, according to economists.",

      "Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the U. of Michigan's initial survey likely failed to capture any improvement in sentiment from the U.S. and China agreeing to ease tariffs earlier this week.",
      "\"[W]e increasingly suspect that the consumer surveys, and the Michigan survey in particular, are painting an unduly negative picture of the consumer outlook at present,\" Allen said in a report. \"Headline retail sales eked out a further small gain in April, following a 1.7% jump in March, despite the recent plunge in confidence. Moreover, most near-real indicators of consumers' discretionary spending on services are holding up well.\"",
      "Trump in April slapped 145% tariffs on all imports from China, a move that effectively froze trade with the U.S.' third-largest trading partner in goods.

    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for their jobs, higher education, and health and child care.",
      "LISEP tracks costs associated with what the research firm calls a \"basket of American dream essentials.\" The group says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",

      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "In recent years, the top customer complaints have been related to cancellations and delays, refunds, lost or damaged baggage, reservations, fares, customer service, disabilities, involuntary bumping and more.",

That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found.

    "summary": "From $99 dresses on DoorDash to bespoke gowns, David's Bridal strives to charm every kind of bride.",
    "story": [
      "David's Bridal, the 75-year-old company serving budget-conscious brides and wedding parties, is courting the \"affordable luxury\" market.",
      "The go-to store for brides on a budget has launched a higher-end, bricks-and-mortar chain called Diamonds & Pearls that offers dresses ranging from $700 to more than $5,000. David's expansion into the luxury segment comes two years after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inflation and pressures.",
      "The first Diamonds & Pearls store opened Thursday in Delray Beach, Florida. David's operates 193 stores across the U.S., selling gowns that range in cost from $500 to $3,000.",
      "While the company has long held a grip on the value-end of the bridal market, it was missing the luxury piece and wanted to serve customers looking for premium offerings, David's CEO Kelly Cook told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We found that 90% of all brides were in David's funnel, but we didn't have products to serve the couture bride, or the budget bride. We only had products to serve the middle,\" Cook said. \"Affordable luxury is the fastest-growing segment we have.\"",
      "Cook explained that brides are under pressure as tariffs weigh on the cost of weddings, which stands at $37,500 on average, she said. An\u00a0estimate from Fidelity pegs the average cost of a wedding in 2024 at $33,000.",
      "David's solved the budget consumer's end of the equation first. In March, it began selling wedding dresses for as little as $99, under the DB Studio label. And in December 2024, David's partnered with delivery service DoorDash to let customers order dresses on the app and have them delivered in minutes \u2014 along with dessert.",
      "Roughly 17% of David's brides are shopping for dresses for weddings that are within three weeks, \"So we have to serve the last-minute brides,\" Cook said.",
      "Now, it's moving up the luxury scale, offering made-to-order dresses, including gowns from designers like Marchesa and Viola Chan, and serving champagne to brides-to-be at its Diamonds & Pearls store. The company has plans to open at least one more Diamonds & Pearls store this year, Cook said.",
      "Cook's ultimate goal for the company is to serve every type of consumer \u2014 including grooms \u2014 along every step of the wedding planning process. That includes launching its own AI-powered wedding planning tools, video content and more.",
      "The company is now in a growth spurt, undeterred by President Trump's evolving tariff program\u00a0that is dissuading some companies from investing in growth. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, which now stand at 30% for a period of 90 days.",
      "Although it previously produced 67% of its own line of dresses in China, David's plans to move all of its production out of China by the end of June, according to Cook, adding that its factories in Myanmar, India and Vietnam will pick up the slack.",
      "Despite the range in prices, DB Studio, dresses on DoorDash and Diamonds & Pearls all share a common denominator, which is \"absolute quality,\" according to Cook.",

      "The world's largest retailer said President Trump's wide-ranging levies on U.S. trade partners are impeding its ability to keep prices low for its customers.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes will go into effect later this month. Walmart, a bellwether for consumer spending, joins other larger retailers in warning that they are\u00a0likely to raise prices\u00a0as tariffs drive up their costs.",
      "Rising cost pressures for retailers",
      "The Trump administration on Monday said that, starting May 14, it is lowering the tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days. As part of that agreement, China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%. The sides are expected to continue negotiations, although ongoing uncertainty over trade policy is weighing on companies.",
      "\"The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world from dozens of countries,\" McMillon said. \"Other than the U.S., the other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada. China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\"",
      "Still, the Walmart executive emphasized that the retailer will do what it can to avoid\u00a0passing the import taxes onto customers.",
      "\"We'll do our best on what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,\" McMillon said. \"In  some cases we are holding retail prices where they are despite the tariffs cost pressures.\"",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March, according to government data. However, many household costs remain elevated, the CBS News price tracker shows.",
      "Walmart also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, as Mr. Trump vows to strike favorable trade deals with countries that are subject to steep levies on imports.",
      "Walmart earned $4.4 billion in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.1 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.6 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Tariff hit on consumer spending",
      "Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in the earnings call that the company expects the U.S. to strike more agreements with its trade partners, and that tariff rates could drop.",
      "\"However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year-over-year,\" he added.",
      "Tuan Nguyen, U.S. economist at consulting firm RSM US, said the latest retail data shows consumers are reducing their spending at stores and restaurants.",
      "\"We are now witnessing the first-order effects of tariffs on the economy \u2014 through reduced spending. The second-order impact \u2014 on prices \u2014 will likely emerge in the coming months, putting additional pressure on demand,\" he said in an email.",

      "When his new shipments began arriving two weeks ago, he was hit with President Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. The duty tax bills he received from U.S. Customs ranged from $9,000 to $21,000.",

They'd rather leave the goods here until the last minute when they need them.\"",

      "One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Grouette spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn't land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \"It was this implied, 'You're stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "Indeed, despite the unemployment rate still hovering at a historic low\u00a0at 4.2%, for an increasing number of out-of-work Americans, it's taking longer to find a new job. Meanwhile, the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.",
      "Grouette, however, eventually found a way out of her toxic workplace. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she was working a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\"You can't put a price tag on it,\" she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\"",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\"We're developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\" said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Disagreement vs. abuse",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \"if I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a 'Suck it up' attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \"I don't think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\"",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\"What makes something toxic: It's more pervasive, more consistent over time,\" Tosti-Kharas said. \"You may have tried some things and it's not getting better. ... It's very deeply entrenched.\"",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\"It is a relationship where you can't communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can't say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\" Atchison said.",
      "Follow your gut",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\"I'm reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I'm applying to, because I can't lose my hair again over a job,\" said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\"It's almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\" Atchison said. \"If someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\"",
      "More complaints since COVID-19",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\"Socializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "Document your concerns",
      "\"Don't hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you're talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don't internalize it. And don't take someone's perception as fact.\"",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \"I'm going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\" she said. \"Is there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else's opinion?\"",
      "Human resources may or may not help",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \"In the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it's you who has to go somewhere,\" Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \"you wouldn't say, 'Let me try to work with the radon,' or 'How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?'\" she said. \"You would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\"",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\"If somebody gives you an impression that you're not able to leave this job, that's just not true,\" Grouette said. \"Those sorts of people don't have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they're volatile to you, they're volatile to others.\"",

If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",

      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "\"We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks \u2014 a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,\" Powell said Thursday at a\u00a0conference in Washington, D.C., where U.S. bankers were meeting to discuss monetary policy.",
      "Analysts\u00a0have also warned that U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls as a result of tariff-induced supply chain issues. Container bookings from China to the U.S. dropped as much as 60% following the pre-tariff spike in imports according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "Powell acknowledged at the conference that the economic environment has changed since the Fed's last strategy meeting in 2020, when interest rates were far lower than they are today.",

The Fed last week decided to hold that rate steady \u2014 \u00a0a sign it is still weighing the economic risks posed by the Trump administration's tariffs. The central bank is scheduled to meet again in mid-June, where it's expected to maintain its benchmark rate at its current range, according to\u00a0predictions from CME FedWatch.",

      "Inflation eased slightly last month\u00a0but is still above the Fed's 2% goal.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:07:32 -0400",
    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",
      "This tax break would last only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Expanding the estate tax exemption",
      "The estate tax exemption was temporarily doubled under the TCJA, but that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025. In the current tax year, gifts and inheritances of up to almost $14 million for individuals and $28 million for married couples are exempted from federal gift or estate taxes.",
      "Without a change, that threshold will revert to its pre-TCJA level, or about $7 million for an individual.",
      "The new bill would permanently extend the higher estate tax exemption, while boosting it to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026. After that, the exemption would be indexed to inflation.",

      "Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition vehicles because of a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function increasing the risk of crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0said in recall dated May 9.",
      "Affected vehicles may have \"a bent brake line\" that could come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which is a hose used to transfer filtered air from the car's air filter to it engine. As a result, the outlet pipe may become damaged, resulting in a brake fluid leak, causing the vehicle's front brakes to stop working, recall documents\u00a0state.",
      "\"A brake line leak may cause a longer-than-expected brake pedal travel and result in a reduction in the rate of deceleration. If there is a rapid loss of brake fluid or the brake fluid is completely depleted, this can extend the distance required to stop the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash,\" the NHTSA states in its report.",

An internal review of plant records conducted by the U.S. carmaker's Critical Concern Review Group earlier this year, discovered that modifications to the engine installation process had been make by the Louisville plant in November in order to prevent damage to the brake line.",
      "\"Through this investigation, Ford's CCRG discovered that Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant (KTP) had modified the radiator hose stowage process during engine decking. This modification was done to prevent the brake line from being bent and was made starting on Nov. 20, 2024 to ensure proper clearances were met,\" the recall documents say.",

      "Homeownership is considered a mainstay of the American dream, but a shortage of affordable homes is blocking that pathway for many middle-income families, according to a new analysis from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half of all listings before the pandemic, according to the analysis of property listings in the nation's biggest 100 cities. To get back to that pre-pandemic level of affordable homes, the U.S. would have to add more than 400,000 new listings priced at $255,000 or below, it found.",
      "The median sale price in the first-quarter of 2025 was almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The affordability gap has its roots in the housing crisis that started in 2006, which caused new construction to dry up for years afterward, she added.",
      "The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property, Evangelou said. The result: More middle-income families are getting shut out of the housing market in many regions.",
      "\"It's discouraging for many people now,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.\"",
      "These households represent people in careers such as nursing and teaching and in trades like plumbing, she added. \"The middle-income buyers are the backbone of the housing market, so we need homes they can actually afford,\" Evangelou said.",
      "Where the affordability gap is worst",
      "Twenty-six of the biggest 100 cities have affordability gaps that are worsening, the NAR research found. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties, Evangelou added.",
      "They range from high-cost cities like Los Angeles to more affordable areas like the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Scranton in Pennsylvania, the report found.",
      "Partly because of restrictive zoning rules, Pennsylvania ranked 44th out of all U.S. states in the pace of new housing built from 2017 to 2023, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit foundation that conducts research on areas that shape public policy.",
      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",

      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "\"While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,\" Saunders said.",

Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 18, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, if you're ready, we'll dig in.",
      "FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT GATES: Okay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's a lot to ask you about, sir. So President Trump just concluded this week-long trip through the Middle East. He's lifted sanctions on Syria and its interim new government. He is trying to get some kind of diplomatic deal with Iran. He's courting a lot of Gulf money. So far, no success in getting Israel to stop its war in Gaza. But how would you judge his foreign policy focus to date?",
      "SEC. GATES: What's interesting to me is that we're back in the Middle East, after all the talk about the pivot to Asia and- and China and so on. We have two aircraft carriers, strike groups, in the Middle East. We had the president in the Middle East. I don't have to say this though, Margaret, I think, ironically, the Middle East may be one place where there are some real opportunities and- and- and possibilities. I think that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, are all so focused on diversifying their economies, reforming, modernizing, bringing their populations into the 21st century. It's a- it's a place to do business, for China, for the United States, for everybody else. The actions of Israel, post the October 7 massacre by Hamas, has really changed the strategic equation in the Middle East, because Iran has been dramatically weakened, mainly by Israel's attacks on Hamas, on the attack- our attacks on the Houthis, but also, and especially, Hezbollah, and the weakening of Hezbollah. And with the fall of Assad, Syria is no longer a conduit for Iranian weapons to get to Hezbollah. So- and then you add to that, the Iranian- the Israeli air attack on the Iranian nuclear facility that basically wiped out their air defenses. Iran's in a very weak place now. And if there is an opportunity to do a deal on nuclear, this is it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, when it comes to that nuclear program, you didn't really like the Obama era nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump is trying something that may be somewhat similar. What do you think has to be in it for it to really be a success?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I think- I- I would agree with those in the Senate and- and elsewhere that Iran really has to stop their nuclear program. They have to stop their enrichment entirely. And they have to give up--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Entirely, not just--",
      "SEC. GATES: Entirely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --highly enriched, all enrichment?",
      "SEC. GATES: Entirely. And- and if they want to have a civil nuclear program, they need to import the uranium, the enriched uranium, to do that. But they need to get rid of the stockpile. They were- they were supposed to get rid of a big part of the stockpile earlier. But I think- I think just given the nature of their program and the secretiveness of the whole thing, I think in terms of monitoring compliance, you really have to get rid of- of- of their program in a way that it can be monitored by international experts from the IAEA or- or whoever. But I- you know, one of my concerns, and- and- that's not going- with the earlier agreement, that's apparently not going to be addressed and won't be in this, was the need for them to get rid of their ballistic missile programs. And I think that's not going to be in- if there is an agreement, it doesn't look to me like that's going to be a part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you said, no enrichment. It's not clear what the president's policy is, because he has different advisors who say different things about what the end state is. And some of that, according to our reporting, is because the president has to make some of those very central policy decisions still. That's a different approach, I'm sure, from White Houses you worked in, where you went in with a goal, a strategy, and you worked back from there. Not, let's talk, and then figure out the strategy.",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I have the impression, and- and I- I don't talk to anybody in the administration, but- so it's just what I hear and what I read. But, I think that his approach is, let's pursue these different avenues and see how far we can get, and if we can get a deal that includes getting rid of the entire- entirely of the enrichment, then that's what we ought to strive for. But if we can't, maybe we settle for something short of that. And- and I think it's basically just playing it tactically, if you will, in terms of seeing what's possible, but with the overall objective of getting some kind of an agreement, and I would hope one that can be monitored by the U.S. or by others to make sure the Iranians aren't cheating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you oppose an Israeli strike with U.S. support on Iran's nuclear program?",
      "SEC. GATES: The problem that I've had with a strike on the Iranian nuclear program, from the time I was secretary, is that it buys you a year or two. You're not going to be able to destroy, short of- as long as you're using conventional weapons, you cannot get at the very deeply buried parts of the Iranian nuclear program. That's why on site inspection is so important, because you really can't- there's no- there's no kind of ordnance. Even our massive ordnance penetrator won't get that far down. So my argument is, if you attack their nuclear program in a way designed to try and destroy it, you will simply make the Iranians more determined to have a nuclear weapon and to bury the whole program even deeper. It buys you a little time, but it doesn't solve the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president seems to be saying, the threat of military force exists, but he really wants a diplomatic deal.",
      "SEC. GATES: That's certainly my impression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have a history with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. You're smiling. His government, you've said, acts like an ungrateful ally. We're starting to see some points of friction with the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government in particular. Are- are we at the point now where President Trump needs to publicly be clear that the war in Gaza has to end, and withhold U.S. support if it doesn't?",
      "SEC. GATES: I think it would be a very heavy political lift for the President to say he's going to cut off military supplies to Israel, unless they stop in Gaza. I think he can say a lot of things in terms of putting pressure on Netanyahu to stop the war. He can put forward proposals on how humanitarian assistance and other things might might go forward. But I would- I- it would be very difficult for any U.S. president, I think, to say we're just going to cut Israel off from military supplies--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you did support- I remember President Biden's decision to withhold very specific- actually, just delay delivery of very specific weapons.",
      "SEC. GATES: Well, over time, and including when I was Secretary, I opposed providing Israel with certain kinds of ordinance, mainly because what they wanted was the kind of ordinance that would allow them to attack Israel- attack the Iranian nuclear program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a cost to this ongoing support of such a bloody war, given the projections from U.S. intelligence about the long term recruitment of- among terror groups around the world because of the devastation?",
      "SEC. GATES: I think there is a cost. I think it does provide a basis for radicalization in the region. But it is interesting to me that you're not hearing much out of the Gulf Arabs and- and others in terms of decrying the ongoing operations and so on. I think- I mean, what has been the case to- to date is that the Saudis have really insisted that there be something for the Palestinian people before they would do- before they would establish diplomatic relations with Israel. I don't know as a result of this week's talks whether that may have shifted in some way, but- but clearly they are worried about the feelings of their own people toward the- in their countries, about the- about what has happened to the Palestinians, and what is continuing to happen to the Palestinians. And I think they are worried that- that there could be some protests and- and strong feelings on the part of their populations. And the governments, I think, are all for establishing relationships with with Israel, as- as the UAE and others have done. But I think- I think that it's still a problem for the Saudis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to another part of the world, and that is Ukraine. Secretary of State Rubio said he believes that there won't be a clear read on Vladimir Putin's intentions until he sits down with President Donald Trump. You've met Putin before. Would you- what would you advise for that one-on-one? And does it really take a face-to-face to judge Putin's intentions?",
      "SEC. GATES: I'm not sure even in a face to face that you can judge Putin's intentions. My own view, having dealt with him and having spent most of my life working on Russia and the Soviet Union, is Putin feels that he has a destiny to recreate the Russian Empire. And as my old mentor, Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, without Ukraine, there can be no Russian Empire. So I think the President is- based on what I read, is getting the sense that, as he put it, that Putin is tapping him along and- and that, you know, Putin hasn't given up on any of his original goals in Ukraine. He's going to insist on occupying all four of the eastern provinces of the Donbas. Perpetual recognition of Russian ownership of Crimea. A pro Russian government in Kyiv and a Ukrainian military that looks a lot like an enhanced police force. And, no membership in NATO and probably no membership in the EU he wants- he wants Ukraine, basically, to be a client state of Russia. And I don't- I don't see what it would take to get him to walk away from any of those goals in the foreseeable future. I mean, when you look at 900,000 or so Russian soldiers that have been killed or wounded. He's paid a huge price- the Russian economy and so on. It hasn't deterred him in the slightest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has he paid a price, though? Because there are analysts who look at the way he's reoriented that economy around his military, the fact that he gets that lifeline from China, and say sanctions haven't made him buckle one bit in his desire to continue this war.",
      "SEC. GATES: No, that's absolutely correct. And he has militarized the economy, and absolutely there has been a cost- a long term cost for the Russian people. You know, you've had upwards of a million young Russian- mainly men, flee the country. Young tech guys, entrepreneurs and others who thought they had a future in Russia and- and when the war started, decided they didn't. And- and the complete reorientation of the- of the economy for the military industrial complex, as you will, it is very much what the Soviets did in many respects and- and I think he's got 21% interest rates. I mean, the economy is chugging along, it's got positive growth, but it's artificial. The only source of income of revenue for the Russian government is oil and gas. The problem that Putin has is over time, those are old oil and gas fields, and what was enabling the Russians to extract from those fields was Western technology, the Exxons, the Chevrons, the other big oil companies from the West that had the technology. That's all gone. So over time, the revenue stream from oil and gas from Russia is going to diminish, and probably fairly dramatically, but it'll take time. So long term, he has- he has, I think, cost Russia enormously. But that doesn't mean that in the short to near term, it's going to force him to change any of his policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you advise President Trump not to take that face-to-face, even if Vladimir Putin was willing to do it?",
      "SEC. GATES: I would like to see what if- I were ever asked, I would say you need to figure out some leverage that you have going into that meeting with Putin. What- what can- what can you do that puts more pressure to bear on Putin to make him believe his- his interests are served by not just a ceasefire, but a- basically, at least freezing things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen a very different approach to this diplomacy, too. The President has been relying on his close friend Steve Witkoff, this former real estate developer, to really be the face with some of the most thorny issues we have in the national security portfolio, including meeting with the Iranian negotiator over a nuclear program, including getting face-to- face with Vladimir Putin. There is a value in having a fresh set of eyes. But is it advisable to put aside the experts, including American translators, and not include them in those meetings?",
      "SEC. GATES: Well, I've always believed that it's a mistake not to have an American interpreter in meetings. The President and Mr. Witkoff are not the first Americans to believe- and he's not the first president to believe, he doesn't need an American interpreter in the room. I think it's always a mistake, because you never know that what you're saying is, in fact, being interpreted to Putin or whoever, exactly as you said it. And so I think that's a mistake. On the other hand, you know, bringing fresh eyes and fresh blood to some of these problems. You know, I know people who've been involved in the Middle East negotiations for peace for 30 years, you know, and have not much to show for it, and then all of a sudden, you bring in somebody else, and things happen like the Abraham Accords. So I- I'm not- I'm not willing to say that you shouldn't bring in some people that have not got a lot of experience. In fact, one of the reasons in 2016 I recommended Rex Tillerson to the- to President Trump for his first Secretary of State, was precisely because, as a businessman, not a diplomat, but as a businessman, Tillerson had negotiated with tough guys all over the world for most of his career. So I think bringing somebody with business background in who's done this kind of thing, it may make a lot of sense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even when they're sitting across some- from someone who has spent decades facing off with Americans? Or in the case of the Iranian nuclear negotiations, someone who negotiated the last nuclear accord? That's a lot of experience--",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 --I think- I think just because the guy on the other side of the table has been doing it for a long time doesn't mean you- you can't bring in somebody- somebody fresh, somebody new.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How sustainable do you think it is for the Secretary of State to also be the national security adviser, the acting archivist and the acting director of USAID?",
      "SEC. GATES: It's interesting a lot of people point to the precedent of when Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State and National Security Advisor from 1973 to 1975. I was at the NSC during most of that period, and all I can tell you is Henry Kissinger was an absentee landlord. I mean, what made it work in that time was that Henry had a very experienced and wise deputy in General Brent Scowcroft. And Scowcroft essentially ran the NSC day to day, and Henry would appear now and then, but- but mainly did his Secretary of State job. He still had the title and a lot of papers going to the presidents from the NSC still went through him, but- but day to day, the NSC and the whole interagency process was really managed by Scowcroft. So whether or not this will work, I think, depends on whether the Secretary of State has a deputy at the NSC who is very experienced, knows the interagency and- and- and is respected and trusted by the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a unique challenge with the NSC, with this president I've heard from officials which is he does not trust the National Security Council because of the history with the first impeachment. So he is suspect of a lot of people who sit there. What's the danger of that, when you don't trust the people who are briefing you on some of the most sensitive national security issues, or advising you?",
      "SEC. GATES: I think it's important for people to remember, and I tried to observe this myself- since I worked on the NSC under four presidents, the NSC is the President's personal foreign policy staff. So I think if- if people on the NSC, and I don't care whether they come from the State Department or CIA or the military or anyplace else or from the outside. If you can't- in- on that staff, if you can't be loyal to the president, then you should leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean loyal?",
      "SEC. GATES: I mean be willing- embrace his policies and do what you can to implement those policies and to ensure that the other agencies are implementing the President's policies. And when the time comes, if the time comes, that you disagree with those policies, then it seems to me it's incumbent on you to return to your agency or to leave the government. I can't- this is really an important point. This is his personal staff. This is the staff that drafts his letters going back to other leaders. This is the staff that does his talking points for meetings with foreign leaders and provides background information for him. So I think- I think he has a right to- to expect loyalty. What I- my line- my line, when I was at the NSC, was be loyal or be gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Including when it means having a different view of the last election or having family members who work in the Justice Department? I mean, there are some different definitions of loyalty.",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Absolutely. And again, if, if you- if you- if your views are- if you hold views that are unacceptable to the President on things like that, like the election and so on, then you probably don't belong in his NSC staff. Maybe you belong at the State Department or at CIA or someplace, but you don't belong inside the White House complex. I mean, I know that's a hard thing to say, but, but I've watched this and and, and I've seen- you know, if you go back to the Nixon days, a number of- a number of NSC staffers resigned from the NSC over Vietnam because of the bombing campaigns and so on. So that's- those are the kinds of issues, it seems to me, where- where you need to be loyal. I think you need to give the president your honest views on things, on the subjects that you're in charge of. And it may be unwelcome to him, but he needs to hear different perspectives and different points of view. So being loyal doesn't mean not- it doesn't mean pulling your punches in terms of the policy debate, but once the president's made a decision, then you have to salute.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the point of honestly briefing and giving sometimes hard to deliver information that's necessary. You were not just a director at the CIA, you were a long-time CIA person yourself. The president gets that daily briefing. A lot of that intel comes from the agency. The current Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, CBS is reporting she's really trying to exert more control over that daily brief, pull it away from the agency. Does that concern you?",
      "SEC. GATES: She's not the first to try and do that. There were moves in that direction, actually, during the Reagan administration. And we started including in the President's daily brief contributions from, say, the Defense Intelligence Agency that had not been done before. But I think- I think that, you know, having that, you know, the Director of National Intelligence, I think, was not expected to sort of take a daily supervisory role over the content of the information flowing to the president. I think, you know, we would get information from NSA, from DIA, from all these different agencies. CIA did put together the president's brief, but my understanding is in recent years, there's been more and more of a move to have other members of the intelligence community collaborate on putting together the president's daily brief. So I'm I'm not really aware of the details right now, but, but it seems to me that- I remember when, I when I was head of the analytical side of CIA, probably the Director of Central Intelligence who took the greatest day-to-day interest in the PDB was Jimmy Carter's Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral Stanfield Turner, who would literally edit the PDB before it was put to bed. Most D.C. eyes have not touched the PDB. They have, they have let- let the professionals put in there what they needed to put in there, and then, and then they got the fury of the president when he disagreed with something that was in the PDB.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any concerns when you look at some of the reshaping, some of the firings within intelligence that- the two heads, for example, of the National Intelligence Council, were just dismissed by Gabbard.",
      "SEC. GATES: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know enough about the details to be able to comment. The one thing that I would say concerns me, both at CIA and at the Defense Department, are the firings of probationary employees--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The new blood.",

These are the young people dedicated to public service who bring in skills such as data analytics and so on, that- that are their older peer- people don't have, and they're the future of the agency. And there are ways to reduce the manpower and reduce the number of people at these agencies, and most agencies should be reformed and should be made more lean and more efficient, but there's a way to do it that doesn't shortcut the future and also doesn't end up firing people that actually are really needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that's what Elon Musk and the DOGE effort did?",
      "SEC. GATES: I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That America lost new talent--",
      "SEC. GATES: I think there--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that was important.",
      "SEC. GATES: I think there has been a cost in talent with the categorization of the people. And I think the reason that probationaries were put at the top was because they're easier to fire and- but that doesn't mean that was the right thing to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 When we look around the world right now, there are a lot of hot spots, not just this land war in Ukraine, in the middle of Europe, you have missile attacks between two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, you have China's increased aggression in Asia, the ongoing Israeli war, as we talked about. Two years ago, I re-read this essay that you wrote two years ago, and you said the U.S. confronts graver threats to its security than it ever has. Two years later, what does the playing field look like to you?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 I think that if anything, the peril has gotten greater, simply because both Russia and especially China have significantly increased their arsenals and their military power. And particularly, as I say in the case of China, China has been much more aggressive in the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea than they were two years ago. I think they put themselves in a position, if they chose to do so, to put essentially a stranglehold around Taiwan in terms of shipping and so on. And you know, what we've never faced before is large, aggressive nuclear powers, both in Europe and in Asia, collaborating. And what we are facing today we've never faced as a country, is a country that's almost as rich as we are, that is technologically advanced, competing with us in many areas of technology, technology advances and- and one that has unanswered ambitions, unfulfilled ambitions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about China.",
      "SEC. GATES: --in the neighborhood, all China. And so, you know, China is the bigger threat by far, but doesn't negate the 1,500 nuclear weapons that the Russians have either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet.",
      "SEC GATES: I'm sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet, they're expanding, right?",
      "SEC GATES: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you've said, though, of China, I mean, you look at what's happening with their expansion. There was this trade war that on Monday was paused in some way in terms of the tariffs. There are some that are still in place, but some delayed for at least 90 days. Was there a point? Was there a win that came out of this confrontation?",
      "SEC. GATES: My view is that if China is your primary competitor, your primary rival, your primary adversary, and we can avoid a military confrontation with China, then the outcome is going to be- is going to be settled by non-military instruments of power, above all, economics. And you would think that if we were going to put significant additional economic pressure on China, we would want all the other countries around the world to be on our side of the table and willing to collaborate with us in putting those pressures on China and saying you can't- you can't behave the way you have been. You can't dump, you can't steal intellectual property, you can't do these things. And to have most of the developed countries in the world, in essence, echoing each other and on the same page. Declaring trade wars on all of them did not, shall we say, enhance their willingness to collaborate with us against China. So who's the main enemy? And I think that's always the key question. I understand the imbalance in trade and- and that other countries, the Europeans, have never done as much since the end of the Cold War on defense as they should. I bellowed about it, like a lot of other American officials. But the question is, what's the main strategic threat, and what's the best strategy for dealing with that threat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So having a tariff war with Europe, Japan, South Korea, all the allies at once, you're saying is self defeating.",
      "SEC. GATES: I think- I think it doesn't make strategic sense. Now, others look at it from a more purely economic standpoint, and I understand that. But- but I think we have to, we have to decide, you know, is more revenue and reshoring- how does more revenue and reshoring of manufacturing balance off against what many in this administration consider, and both Republicans and Democrats on the Hill, consider to be the main, the main threat. And are there ways that you apply those tariffs in ways that maybe accomplish both goals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote in Foreign Affairs, President Trump's \"disdain for U.S. allies, his fondness for authoritarian leaders, his willingness to sow doubt about the United States' commitment to NATO allies, and his generally erratic behavior undermined us credibility and respect across the globe.\" That was about his first term. He's back. Are you seeing a repeat of those behaviors now?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 I think that- I think that he has been more cautious about the language that he has used. He has not talked about not fighting for other countries. He hasn't said, well, I'm not going to participate in Article V, we're not going to go to war for Europe. I mean, there's been some tough language toward the Europeans, the Vice President in Munich and so on, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said things again about, oh if they don't pay up--",
      "SEC. GATES: It's clear--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't take it seriously.",
      "SEC. GATES: It's clear he does not see the allies- see our allies as- as an important asset for America's national interests, as a lot of us do. I think, and- and the Europeans have given him ammunition by not being willing to provide for their own defense in even the most modest way. But I think he has avoids- avoided some of the more inflammatory language toward NATO that he used in the first term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about the Pentagon, which you ran for a while. You hear a lot these days about identity politics, including when the Secretary of Defense addresses troops. Warrior and war fighting ethos is the mantra. You used to go out and speak to troops, including those serving overseas. What do you think that kind of message is doing? Is that the right tone?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I think that- I mean it- as I understand it, it derives from a belief that in the Biden administration, that the leadership of the Pentagon was distracted by the need to pursue diversity in- initiatives and so on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think they were?",
      "SEC. GATES: You know, I live a long way from the Pentagon. I don't know. I think that, you know, if you look at what some of the military leaders have said, the amount of time that soldiers and leaders actually spent on those issues was pretty small, but it may have been more the focus of public remarks and things like that. I don't know whether it distracted people or not, but I know- I mean, my view is that a big part of the warrior ethos is taking care of your people. Every Second Lieutenant learns that, first thing. And- and so I think- think having a focus on being combat ready, on fitness, on those kinds of things absolutely makes sense and- and I think making sure- and when we talked about various changes, such as the decision made that I made in terms of women serving on submarines, and women going into the Special Forces and so on, the line always was, you can't compromise the standards. The expectations for women need to be exactly the same as they are for men and- and so a focus on that kind of meritocracy, I think, also makes sense. But I think you also have to remember the military needs to look like the American people, and it does. And you can call it whatever you want, but- but we are better served, in my view, by a military that reflects the American people and- and I think it does at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The last two national defense strategies said the U.S. military is not postured or equipped to fight wars against two major rivals at the same time. You've talked about the need to fund defense more. Right now, even the Republican Chair of the Armed Services Committee says the White House isn't doing enough. If the focus is on war, fighting and a warrior ethos, isn't that contradictory?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 I think there is a general understanding about two things. One is the Pentagon needs to get much more efficient and needs to be reformed, especially when it comes to acquisitions and the integration of new technologies. The second is that it needs more money to do those things and- and to fund new capabilities. The Department of Defense has not had a budget going into the fiscal year for 15 years. If there isn't- if that isn't a dereliction of duty by the Congress, I don't know what is. Because when you have a continuing resolution, you can't start anything new, you can't add to anything. People talk about- about expanding the ship building capabilities, about expanding our defense industrial capability and so on. And for all the speeches they make, nothing's happening because they haven't voted a single dollar to do any of those things. So there is this- and I don't understand, under the circumstances, why the administration's budget puts forward a budget for the Pentagon that, as I understand it, is basically flat, which, given some inflation means a cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's exactly what the Republican Chair of the Armed Services Committee \u2013 he said \"it's going to shred to the bone our military capabilities and support to service members.\" He said it amounts to a cut and that it contradicts what the President had promised.",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 There has to be an agreement between the president and the Congress on actually what has to be done to recapture our industrial- military industrial capabilities, and- and then for Congress to vote the money in a timely way. Let me give you one example of- of how big the gap is with China. Between 2017 and 2024, the number of warships in our Navy stayed essentially flat. During that same period, China launched 150 warships. They have 250 times the ship cap- building capability we do. This was us in World War II, and now the tables have been turned. We represent kind of 1/10 of 1% of global shipping- ship building capability. They've got over half. So if we're going to fix that, somebody's got to get off the dime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So then in that context, is it worth to spend as much as $45 million on a military parade on June the 14th, which happens to be the President's birthday?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I'll leave that up to- up to the gurus in Washington. In my career, we had one military parade in Washington, and that was after the Gulf War, and I don't- and I think we had to do some repair work on the streets in D.C. after that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You served in public service for nearly 50 years. What is your advice to graduates who are looking at the administration's message that the private sector is more productive than the public one, and when they look at all the cuts that are happening to federal agencies? Is it worth it to go into public service?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I totally believe it's worth it to go into public service. There are few things you can do that are more gratifying and more satisfying, and when you look back, being able to say that maybe you made a difference in keeping the nation safer or the nation better off. The reality is government- government- the American government has generally been an enabler of the American people, in terms of education, in terms of opportunities and so on, and protecting opportunities. People make government work, and you want the best people you can get in those jobs. For all the rhetoric, the American civil service is the most honest and efficient anywhere in the world, and has been for a very long time. Does that mean it can't be improved? Absolutely not. Every organization needs to be reformed and improved, but these young people and their dedication and their- their possession of skills that older people don't have, data analytics and so on, they're crucial to the future of these agencies. And- and- and they shouldn't be daunted. We've been through bad times before. I was- I joined CIA at the height of Vietnam. Those were pretty rough days. 1968 was as bad a year as the United States maybe has had since the Civil War, internally, and with deep divisions and- and distrust of government. And believe me, distrust of government didn't begin recently, it began with Watergate and Vietnam. And so young people need to understand there are great opportunities to serve, and- and I would argue, if you're unhappy about things at the federal level, go into local government or state government. There are lots of different places where you can serve. It doesn't have to be at CIA or the State Department. It could be- it can be in a local NGO of some kind, or a charity. There are lots of ways to do public service, and- and young people who feel motivated to do that, this university has a lot of them. Texas A&M, where I was president, has the George H.W. Bush School of Government and Public Service. Lots of universities have these schools, and they've got a lot of kids who are eager to be helpful and help make the country better. My- my view is they ought to go for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You talked about loss of confidence. Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan recently wrote about the broken windows theory in law enforcement, where you go after the small crimes to dissuade bigger ones. But she was arguing, basically, we need to apply that in politics right now. Are you concerned that even the appearance of corruption, foreign influence peddling, wears away at that, and that perhaps, as she calls for in this piece, that our parties, the Republican and Democratic Parties, need to be a little bit more honest and explicit in policing themselves?",
      "SEC. GATES:\u00a0 Well, I think so, absolutely. I mean, you can't even get legislation on the hill about insider trading. And so I think appearances do matter. And you know, I mean, I remember how strict the rules were when I was in government. If I- if I got a gift when I was traveling from a foreign government, if it was valued at over $300 and I wanted it, I had to pay for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including a Boeing plane from a Gulf country? Over $300. All right, we are out of time. We've covered a lot. There's more to talk about, but I will leave it there, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SEC. GATES: Okay. Thank you Margaret.",

      "\"We've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. Well, here's an example where we're doing that,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community \u2014 White South Africans largely descended from Dutch settlers  \u2014 arrived in the U.S., after President Trump earlier this year directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent, and Afrikaners in particular, to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program.",
      "The White House, along with South African native Elon Musk, have claimed that White South Africans have been the target of oppression by the country's government, pointing to a law that they argue is racially motivated and allows the government to seize privately held land under certain conditions. Until 1994, South Africa was under minority white rule, enforcing the brutal system of apartheid on the country's Black majority.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa and he has claimed a genocide is underway in the country, saying some white farmers have been killed. Asked whether there was evidence of a genocide, Rubio said \"I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties.\"",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures by race. According to BBC News, there were 12 people killed in farm attacks of the 6,953 people who were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of those 12, one was a farmer, while the others were farm dwellers or employees.",
      "Rubio added that \"these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and, in some cases, killed,\"",
      "He urged that \"to move here from half a world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly,\" arguing that \"these people are doing it for a reason.\"",
      "\"So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon,\" he said.",
      "The comments come as South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to visit the White House this week amid the tensions with the Trump administration, as the South African government has strongly denied the claims of land confiscations and racially motivated discrimination.",

      "But we begin on the international front with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. We spoke to him Saturday while he was visiting Rome for Pope Leo XIV's inaugural mass and asked about the outcome of the first talks between Russia and Ukraine in nearly three years. Those took place Friday in Turkey.",
      "Vladimir Putin skipped the meeting that he himself had proposed and instead sent representatives. Ukraine's top diplomat described it as an attempt by Russia to buy time and imitate a peace process.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): They were not a complete waste of time.",
      "For example, there were 1,000 prisoners that are going to be exchanged. And that, from a humanitarian standpoint, is very positive. He explained to me that they are going to be preparing a document outlining their requirements for a cease-fire that would then lead to broader negotiations.",
      "So, obviously, the Ukrainian side is going to be working on their own proposal. And, hopefully, that will be forthcoming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said repeatedly it's just a matter of days, though, in terms of the waning patience that the U.S. has for this diplomacy to succeed.",
      "So are \u2013 are they just tapping you along, as President Trump has said? Are they just seeking to continue to talk to buy time?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out. We'll find out pretty soon.",
      "They met last \u2013 yesterday or the day before in Turkey. From that, they agreed they're going to exchange paper on ideas that get to a cease-fire. If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress. If those papers, on the other hand, have requirements in them that we know are unrealistic, then we'll have a different assessment.",
      "On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward.",
      "Ultimately, one of the things that could help break this logjam, perhaps the only thing that can, is a direct \u2013 direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen. And \u2013 and, hopefully, that'll be worked out soon as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're planning on that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I don't know if \u2013 we're \u2013 we certainly made the offer. The president's made that offer already publicly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date.",
      "But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as \u2013 as feasible. I think the Russian side has also expressed a willingness to do it. And so now it's just a question of bringing them \u2013 bringing everyone together and figuring out where and when.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your Senate colleague, former senate colleague Lindsey Graham was next to you in that meeting with the Ukrainian foreign minister. He has a veto-proof majority on this bill to put sanctions on Russia.",
      "How quickly do you want the option for more sanctions on Russia? Or are you asking him to wait?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, we're not.",
      "Look, the Senate is going to act, ultimately. I mean, I think, in the past, we've asked them to give us a little time to see if we can make some progress on our talks.",
      "But we've also been pretty clear with the Russian side for weeks now, going back six or seven weeks. We've been communicating to the Russian side that this effort was \u2013 was being undertaken, that we anticipated that, when all was said and done, it would have close to 80 co-sponsors in the Senate, and I imagine a comparable percentage of support in the House, that that was an effort we couldn't stop and don't control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to another part of the world.",
      "You've been very involved in the administration's efforts to crack down on this Venezuelan gang TDA that has been designated as a terror group by the U.S.",
      "Do you accept the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang is not a proxy force of the Maduro government? That was the National Intelligence Council assessment.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, that's their assessment. They're wrong.",
      "One of the warnings out there by the FBI is not simply that Tren de Aragua are \u2013 are a terrorist organization, but one that has already been operationalized to murder a \u2013 to murder a \u2013 an \u2013 an opposition member in another country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a different thing than being a proxy force controlled by the Maduro government. Part of this is at the heart of the legal arguments the administration is having over its ability to continue to deport suspected gang members.",
      "That's why this assessment is so key. You completely reject that intelligence community finding?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They're \u2013 they're \u2013 yes, I agree 100 percent with the FBI's finding.",
      "This is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country, a prison gang that in some cases they've been in cooperation with. And, by the way, Tren de Aragua members that have been returned to Venezuela on some of these planes that have gone back have been greeted like heroes at the airport.",
      "There's no doubt in our mind and in my mind and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: South Africa's president is traveling to the United States this week to meet with President Trump. The administration has prioritized bringing some white South Africans, Afrikaners, to the United States, despite the increased restrictions on refugees.",
      "President Trump claims there's a genocide under way in South Africa. That's a legal determination. The State Department would make it. Are you trying to determine that now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. You can \u2013 they can call it whatever they want, but these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and in some cases killed.",
      "These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of \u2013 of refuge. I \u2013 we've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad.",
      "Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. I think people should be celebrating it, and I think people should be supporting it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, is there evidence of a genocide that you have?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: If, in fact, as many claim, they are in favor \u2013 I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties, both by the government in some cases because of a law they passed, but also because of independent groups encouraged by political parties inside of South \u2013 inside of South Africa.",
      "So, listen, to move here from half-a-world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly. These people are doing it for a reason. So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding this ground operation inside of Gaza. The IDF says it's to seize strategic areas. Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We expand the destruction of Hamas, the ending of Hamas. We support a future for the people of Gaza that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. That's what we support.",
      "And this is a group that came across on October 7 and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, rapes, murders and hostage- taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support.",
      "Now, that said, we also support an end of the conflict, a cease-fire. We don't want people obviously suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but, nonetheless, they're suffering. And so we are actively engaged. Even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some cease-fire-type mechanism.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you asking Israel to slow down this military push?",
      "And the Qatari prime minister told FOX News that there was a deal being put together for all hostages or many hostages to be released after Edan Alexander, that American-Israeli, was released recently, but then the Israeli military bombed a hospital, killing 70 civilians, and everything went sideways.",
      "Is that your understanding of what happened?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I would say that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was this lack of care of collateral damage?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I \u2013 the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately. And Israel's made that clear. It can end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones.",
      "If they did that, this conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that Iran is, in your view, a threshold nuclear state, and we're at a critical moment.",
      "The U.S. and Iran are talking again. Can you clarify what the U.S. policy is here? Is the bottom line that Iran cannot enrich any uranium, even if it is at low levels for civilian purposes? Do they need to fully dismantle the program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, if you're able to enrich at any level, you now are basically able to enrich at weapons grade very quickly. I mean, that's just a fundamental fact, and everyone knows it, and that was the problem with the Obama deal.",
      "But the end goal here is simple. Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president's preference \u2013 because he doesn't like war, the president's preference is to achieve that through a peaceful negotiation.",
      "He's a builder, not a bomber. That's what he views himself as, and that's what he is. He's a president that wants peace, and so he's offered that route. And that's one we hope the Iranians will take.",
      "But he's been very clear. Iran is never going to have the capability. They're never going to have a nuclear weapon. It's not going to happen.",

      "(voice-over): For Palestinians, it is more of what they have endured with little respite for over 19 months, relentless bombing in areas mostly reduced to rubble, a death toll that has seen dozens killed almost every day this week, Israeli orders to evacuate, forcing Palestinians to pack up and move once again with no idea where they are heading to.",
      "More than two-thirds of Gaza has been declared a military no-go zone. The rest is not much safer. Israel has imposed a total aid blockade. For more than 75 days, it has stopped all food and medicine from entering the territory, saying it is to force Hamas to hand over the remaining hostages.",
      "Hunger is so rife that famine is once again stalking Gaza, according to the World Food Program's Antoine Renard, who's just returned from there.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We just showed some reporting from our colleague Debora Patta with incredible pictures from our shooter inside of Gaza, Marwan.",
      "It's hard to look at pictures of children in that level of starvation. You have said: \"The Israeli government is starving civilians and the U.S. is complicit in the gross violation of international law.\"",
      "The U.N. is begging to go in. The Israeli government says they don't want to work with the U.N. here. They want to work with this Gaza humanitarian foundation that's just being set up.",
      "What do you know about this? Should there be U.S. support for it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, Margaret, you're right. It's very hard to look at those pictures. And the United States has been complicit. President Trump was in the region and really did nothing, said virtually nothing about what's happening in Gaza, which is on fire.",
      "We're in the 77th day of a full blockade. Two million Palestinians are starving. This is collective punishment that is clearly illegal under international law. And this other idea that's been cooked up either by the Israelis or by the Trump administration is clearly not fit for purpose when it comes to trying to address this burgeoning famine. And all it will do is further allow food to be used as a weapon of war.",
      "So, I hope the United States will back off this plan. None of the credible international organizations have said that they will participate, because it violates international norms in how it's structured. And so I hope the United States will back off and immediately call today to allow the trucks right now that have food to be able to come provide food to starving people.",
      "These are provided by international aid organizations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that the United States can do in terms of leverage? You were \u2013 you have been bipartisan in your criticism. You said that what happened in Gaza is a black stain on Joe Biden's legacy as president. You are criticizing the current administration for not doing more here.",
      "What leverage is there? I mean, is what you're saying falling on any ears that want to listen?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I have had conversations with some people in the Trump administration and made clear that they need to do more.",
      "One of the very obvious things they could do is, President Trump today could call upon the Netanyahu government to let aid in. I mean, the president acknowledged there are people starving in Gaza the other day. He said so. But why hasn't he called on Netanyahu to let the aid in?",
      "Let's just start with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will follow the diplomacy that Steve Witkoff is leading.",
      "I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. The treasury secretary this morning is dismissing the news that Moody's credit rating agency downgraded America's credit. It's like the first time since 1917. Now all three agencies have said the U.S. fiscal situation is unsustainable.",
      "Moody's specifically said the upcoming bills and spending reductions won't make a difference. You're an appropriator. You are in a position of power here. What is going to happen with Capitol Hill and the president's agenda? Is it going to be much of a fight? Is there going to be anyone pushing back because of this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Oh, yes, Margaret, what you're seeing is, the Republican plan, the Trump plan is essentially to give these huge tax cuts to very wealthy people and corporations, at the expense of everybody else.",
      "They're going to cut Medicaid. They're going to cut food and nutrition programs. But even after those cuts\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they're not, as you know.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: But even \u2013 well, it's in their current House bill. They have $700 billion in Medicaid cuts and $300 billion in food and nutrition programs in the House bill now. I mean, they can always change it.",
      "But, even after that, they're going to \u2013 this will result in a huge spike in the national debt. And so that's why Moody's is warning people that we're going down this road. And it will have a direct harmful impact on every American, because what it will do is drive up interest rates, right?",
      "Just like the Trump across-the-board tariffs are raising prices, so will these big deficits and debts they incur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moody's also says, though, that this has been cumulative, which means Democrats bear some responsibility for the situation we find ourselves in now.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: But just on that point\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: \u2026 I have put forward a variety of plans to close tax loopholes for the very rich to begin to address the deficit problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of responsibility, I'm sure you have been tracking all the headlines and the conversation about President Biden and what happened with that debriefing of him by the special counsel Hur during that Justice Department investigation of his mishandling of classified information.",
      "No charges were brought, but the audio of that was obtained by Axios. In it, you hear the president halting at times. Remember, Hur was the one who said President Biden was a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.",
      "And Democrats really pushed back at the time at that, saying that sounded very political. In hindsight, do you think Democrats were too willing to look the other way?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, hindsight is 20/20. We know a lot more now than we knew then.",
      "I can just say, personally, I had limited interactions with President Biden at the time. He came to the Key Bridge in Maryland when it collapsed, and we had a good conversation. So hindsight is 20/20. Obviously, if we could redo this tape and play it over again, we would do things differently.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like you have to explain and defend that now? I mean, there was a piece in \"The Washington Post\" from Dan Balz who said Democrats are either \u2013 were either covering up then or covering their behinds now.",

      "And particularly, as I say in the case of China, China has been much more aggressive in the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea than they were two years ago. I think they put themselves in a position, if they chose to do so, to put essentially a stranglehold around Taiwan in terms of shipping and so on.",

And what we are facing today, we've never faced as a country, is a country that's almost as rich as we are that is technologically advanced competing with us in many areas of technology, technology advances, and \u2013 and one that has unanswered ambitions, unfulfilled ambitions\u2026",

      "The actions of Israel post the October 7th massacre by Hamas has really changed the strategic equation in the Middle East because Iran has been dramatically weakened. Iran's in a very weak place now. And if there is an opportunity to do a deal on nuclear, this is it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't really like the Obama era nuclear deal with Iran. Now, President Trump is trying something that may be somewhat similar. What do you think has to be in it for it to really be a success?",
      "ROBERT GATES: Iran really has to stop their nuclear program. They have to stop their enrichment entirely. And they have to give up \u2013",

      "ROBERT GATES: Entirely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not just highly enriched? All enriched?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you oppose an Israeli strike with U.S. support on Iran's nuclear program?",
      "ROBERT GATES: The problem that I've had with a strike on the Iranian nuclear program is that it buys you a year or two. You're not going to be able to (INAUDIBLE). Short of \u2013 as long as you're using conventional weapons, you cannot get at the very deeply buried parts of the Iranian nuclear program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're starting to see some points of friction with the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government in particular. Are \u2013 are we at the point now where President Trump needs to publicly be clear that the war in Gaza has to end and withhold U.S. support if it doesn't?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I think it would be a very heavy political lift for the president to say he's going to cut off military supplies to Israel unless they stop in Gaza. I think he can say a lot of things in terms of putting pressure on Netanyahu to stop the war. He can put forward proposals on how humanitarian assistance and other things might \u2013 might go forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Rubio said he believes that there won't be a clear read on Vladimir Putin's intentions until he sits down with President Donald Trump. You've met Putin before. Does it really take a face to face to judge Putin's intentions?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I'm not sure even in a face to face that you can judge Putin's intentions. My \u2013 my own view is, Putin feels that he has a destiny to recreate the Russian empire. Putin hasn't given up on any of his original goals in Ukraine. He's going to insist on occupying all four of the eastern provinces of the Donbas, perpetual recognition of Russian ownership of Crimea, a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and a \u2013 a Ukrainian military that looks a lot like an enhanced police force. He wants Ukraine basically to be a client state of Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you advise President Trump not to take that face to face, even if Vladimir Putin was willing to do it?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I would say you need to figure out some leverage that you have going into this meeting with Putin. What can you do that puts more pressure to bear on Putin, to make him believe his \u2013 his interests are served by, not just a ceasefire, but a \u2013 basically at least freezing things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How sustainable do you think it is for the secretary of state to also be the national security advisor, the acting archivist and the acting director of USAID?",
      "ROBERT GATES: It's interesting. A lot of people point to the precedent when Henry Kissinger was secretary of state and national security advisor from 1973 to 1975. I was at the NSC during most of that period. And all I can tell you is, Henry Kessinger was an absentee landlord. I mean what made it work in that time was that Henry had a very experienced and wise deputy in General Brent Scowcroft. And Scowcroft essentially ran the NSC day to day. And Henry would appear now and then. But \u2013 but mainly did his secretary of state job.",
      "So, whether or not this will work, I think, depends on whether the secretary of state has a deputy at the NSC who is very experienced, knows the inner agency and \u2013 and \u2013 and is respected and trusted by the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With this president, I've heard from officials, which is he does not trust National Security Council because of the history with the first impeachment. So, he is suspect of a lot of people who sit there. What's the danger of that when you don't trust the people who are briefing you on some of the most sensitive national security issues, or advising you?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I think it's important to \u2013 for people to remember, the NSC is the president's personal foreign policy staff. So, I think if \u2013 if people on the NSC \u2013 and I don't care whether they come from the State Department or CIA or the military or anyplace else, or from the outside. On that staff, if you can't be loyal to the president, then you should leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean loyal?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I mean be willing \u2013 embrace his policies and do what you can to implement those policies and to ensure that the other agencies are implementing the president's policies. And when the time comes, if the time comes that you disagree with those policies, then, it seems to me, it's incumbent on you to return to your agency or to leave the government.",
      "I think he has a right to expect loyal. And my \u2013 what I \u2013 my line \u2013 my line when I was at the NSC was, be loyal or be gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including when it means having a different view of the last election? Or having family members who work in the Justice Department? I mean there are some different definitions of loyalty.",
      "ROBERT GATES: Absolutely. If you hold views that are unacceptable to the president on things like that, like the election and so on, then you probably don't believe in his NSC staff. Maybe you belong at the State Department or at CIA or someplace, but you don't belong inside the White House complex.",
      "I think you need to give the president your honest views on things, on the subjects that you're in charge of. And it may be unwelcome to him. But he needs to hear different perspectives and different points of view. So, being loyal doesn't mean not \u2013 it doesn't mean pulling your punches in terms of the policy debate. But once the president's made a decision, then you have to salute.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You served this country for so many decades. What happened that made you say, I can't take it?",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: Well, maybe let me give you a little context. What I saw in Ukraine was horrifying. For three years, Russia launched missiles and drones at men, women and children sleeping in their homes, tried to take down the energy grid for millions of Ukrainians to take out the power, heat and light in the middle of winter, and committed war crimes and atrocities at a level we haven't seen since World War II.",
      "I resigned from Ukraine and also from the foreign service because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all. It's appeasement. And as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear, you are a career diplomat. So, that means you serve regardless of who is the president of the United States and what party they come from. And, in fact, when you tried to leave post in January, Secretary Rubio asked you to stay on in Kyiv, as I understand it. You were there for a number of months until April.",
      "What specifically with this policy is a problem for you? Because you did \u2013 you worked at post under the Trump administration. Was there a trigger that made you say, we're getting it so wrong?",

      "BRIDGET BRINK: Yes, of course, we do. I mean we're the \u2013 the leader and \u2013 of the free world.",
      "I think, let's just be clear, Russia and Putin have invaded a sovereign, independent, democratic country in the heart of Europe with the help of North Korea, Iran and China. This is fundamentally against U.S. interests. Europe is our largest trading partner, is responsible for 16 million jobs on both continents. And having this war, or any festering, unresolved war, on the margins of Europe, is very bad for the United States.",
      "So, what do we need to do as the United States? We need to put, together with partners and allies, pressure on Russia to end the war.",
      "And there are many ways to do this. We can put additional sanctions in the energy sector, in the banking sector. Russia's not as strong as some people say or some people think. The economy is hurting. They have 20 percent interest rates, 21 percent interest rates, 10 percent inflation. And so, right now is the time to increase the pressure on Russia, to bring Putin to the table, not decrease it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we know that President Trump and President Putin have plans to speak on Monday. When you were still in Kyiv, President Zelenskyy called out the U.S. embassy for what he called a disappointingly weak reaction from America following a missile attack that killed small children. He said, \"you must not be afraid to call things by their names, and the U.S. is afraid to even say the word Russian when speaking about the missile that murdered children.\"",
      "Do you feel American officials are being censored from saying things frankly and honestly?",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: I mean, our job as diplomats is to reflect and represent the policy of the \u2013 the president and the administration. That's our job. That's \u2013 that's what we do as professionals. And having worked for five different presidents, that requires reflecting that policy that's made constitutionally by the president.",
      "So, to me, the real question is, how are we going to help to end this war in a way that's in the interest of the United States? And to do that, it can't be peace at any price. It has to be a peace that does things that advance our own interest. And those are really simple. It's how to keep Ukraine free, how to deter Russia and how to send the right signal to China.",
      "And this is what we should be doing. And every step that we make in diplomacy I think should try to help achieve this goal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And call things what they are.",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: It's important for us, as the leader of the free world, again to be clear and accurate. And also, I think, it's an important moment in history. We've seen the devastation that happens when we appease aggressors. And we do not want to do that again. So, my strong advice in terms of how to deal with Putin and Russia is not to give a single meeting or concession or legitimacy until Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire that's verifiable and moves forward toward a just and lasting peace. On that basis, I can see a conversation and \u2013 and diplomacy that can achieve our interests.",

      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL (Retired, CEO And Chairman, McChrystal Group): Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you write that \"character is a choice built upon our deeply held beliefs.\" It sounds like you really think there's a lack of it these days. We certainly see there's a loss of trust in many of our country's institutions, whether it's the federal government, journalism, the courts.",
      "How do you describe our national character right now and the leaders we have?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes, I think it's confused. If you look at polling, as you've just referred to the lack of trust, like, 22 percent of Americans a year ago had trust in the U.S. government. Only 34 percent had trust in other Americans. So, I think we all sort of intuitively know we have a real problem.",
      "But what I would argue is, our national leaders are not the cause of the problem. They're the symptom of the problem. The cause is us at our individual level. Our unwillingness to think about character, to talk about character and to demand character.",
      "And I would also argue that we're also the cure. There is a symptom that we see, and we're distracted by it, all the things that we are disappointed by, people lying, people doing things that we find beneath us. As a nation, our character is our fate. And so what I'm trying to do is convince people to start a national conversation on character with the idea it starts at the bottom. Not at the top. We need to start it down where things actually happen, on farms, in schools. We've just sent out 240 copies of the book to college sports coaches, to try to have them start just to talk about character. And so, that's what I'm passionate about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I admire the effort. You know, it's interesting to look at where this began. Not pinning it on a person.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you're trying to do that. But is it a symptom of, it's always been this way, we just have more transparency and thus we know more about people's flaws? Why does this seem to be building as a problem?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Well, we've always had a problem with certain evil in society and corruption, lack of character. But I think the fact that we see everything so much now we normalize it. We start to accept things in celebrities or leaders that are frankly things we wouldn't have accepted even a generation ago. And that's sort of our problem. We give them our likes on social media. We spend our money with them. We vote for them. And we know better than that. And so I think the responsibility again arcs back to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not a Democrat or a Republican you say.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Though you did endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the last elections.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Most retired military try to stay out of politics and \u2013 and make an argument that that's crossing the Rubicon in some ways.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Well, of course, you go back to Dwight Eisenhower and Ulysses S. Grant. They actually went into politics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fair.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: So, there is some tradition. But that was not my goal to get into politics. I just felt that we had hit a period in which we were so adrift as a nation in terms of character. We were accepting something that is not as good as we are capable of. So, I made a decision. And I'll be honest, it was tough, because there's a lot of pushback from peers and from outsiders that say, you shouldn't get political. But I don't think that saying that America should stand up for its values and for its character is necessarily political.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we had, in the past, conversations with other guests that question about, what does America stand for and does it matter? There is a shift more towards pragmatism or what's in it for me on the national scale. That's very much in our politics right now.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: And I think it's a mistake for the nation. If you think what really helped the United States in the modern area, we'll call it after World War II, people admired American ideas. They admired American democracy. They admired our social, our culture. They didn't like every part of it. And they knew that we, as a nation, make mistakes. But countries and people wanted to be more like us than they wanted to be like the Soviet Union or other enemies. And as long as we are an example that people want to be, it gives us extraordinary influence and power. When it becomes transactional, when we \u2013 when we become somebody that just wants something from them and we're unwilling to be generous, we're unwilling to sacrifice for larger ideals, we lose some of our moral standing and I think some of our national force, our power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the Pentagon right now we hear a lot about values and culture sort of being at odds with the mission, or that's how it's being described, right? Secretary Hegseth has talked a lot about restoring the warrior ethos. That's part of his justification for eliminating diversity programs or DEI. Do you think DEI really, quote/unquote, hurts lethality?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes. I am completely aligned with Secretary Hegseth on the idea that we need to defend the nation, that the Defense Department needs to be as effective as it can be, and that a certain warrior ethos matters. We just define it differently. In my experience, we tend to understand that everybody can contribute. Particularly in today's modern wars. The idea that everybody has got to look a certain way, got to have biceps of a certain size, there's got to be a male, straight, all these things is not my experience. In the counterterrorist fight, where much of my experience was, it became a meritocracy. You didn't care what somebody looked like or how old they were, what their gender was, their sexual orientation, because it was too important to get the job done. And I would argue now, America needs to harness talent from every corner of our society. Everyone. I would even argue that if \u2013 if we went back to a draft, we could draft people with physical disabilities because much of what we do, that's not a block to that. And so, I think we need to think about, what do we need to feel the most effective armed forces. And I think that the DEI thing is frankly a distraction. It's not helpful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of national character, when you were commanding forces, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, you know very well that country. The Taliban has since taken over.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have seen them strip women and girls of even the right to have their voice heard in public. You have seen them carry out retribution against Afghans who worked with our country and put their lives at risk. This past week, the Trump administration said Afghanistan is safe enough for people living here to go back. They stripped the legal protections, the temporary protected status. They are ending some of the programs that helped to evacuate our American allies there. What do you think that says about our character now?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: I think it's disappointing. I personally disagree with that decision. But I also think it sends a message. What about people who we ask to ally with us in the future? That we ask to partner with us. They look at what happened in the past. And so, I think our national character should be bigger than that. And we're capable of being bigger than that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General McChrystal, thank you very much for sharing your reflections.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: You're kind to have me. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your book, \"On Character: Choices that Define a Life.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 18, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And joining us now is Secretary of State Marco Rubio from Rome. Mr. Secretary, you've had a very busy week. I know you have been at the Vatican, and they have offered to host a direct meeting between Ukraine and Russia. Given that Vladimir Putin was a no show at the talks he called for in Istanbul this past week, is there reason to believe that he will take up Pope Leo on the offer?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think if you saw- again, I'm not a spokesperson for the Kremlin, but if you saw their statements, I believe yesterday, where they said that they would be open to such a meeting under the right conditions. So we'll wait and see if that's possible. Obviously, the Vatican has made a very generous offer to host anything, by the way, not just a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, but any meeting, including at a technical level, you know, any meetings that- that need to be hosted, they- they've expressed a willingness to do so. So it's a very generous offer that may be taken up on. I mean, it would be a site that all parties would feel comfortable. So hopefully we'll get to that stage where- where talks are happening on a regular basis and that the Vatican will have the opportunity to be one of the options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The Russian Foreign Ministry is saying that you initiated a call to your Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday. What was that about? Are you talking about lining up that face-to-face meeting between President Putin and President Trump?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we talked about a variety of things. We did talk about- I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. There- they were not a complete waste of time. For example, there were 1,000 prisoners that are going to be exchanged, and that, from a humanitarian standpoint, is very positive. He explained to me that they are going to be pre- preparing a document outlining their requirements for a cease-fire that would then lead to broader negotiations. So obviously, the Ukrainian side is going to be working on their own proposal, and hopefully that will be forthcoming soon. And if that does happen, and the proposal that comes forward from the Russian side and- and for that matter, from the Ukrainian side, are proposals that are serious and viable, then there's been real progress, and we can work off of that. So we'll have to wait and see. But he wanted me to know, and he communicated in our call, that they are- their side will be working on a series of ideas and requirements that they would have in order to move forward with a cease-fire and further negotiations. So we'll await that, and hopefully it's one- it's a document that is close enough to what the Ukrainians want to be able to get to that point and maybe work out those differences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You've said repeatedly it's just a matter of days, though, in terms of the waning patience that the U.S. has for this diplomacy to succeed. So are- are they just tapping you along, as President Trump has said? Are they just seeking to talk- Are they just seeking to continue to talk to buy time?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, that's what we're testing. And that's what we'll know. Look, at the end of the day what I've said, and it's happening now, we're no longer flying all over the world trying to set up meetings. We're responding to meetings that are set up and we're willing- we always said we're willing to do whatever it takes to bring them together if the opportunities present themselves. So I think your question is, are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out. We'll find out pretty soon. They met last- yesterday or the day before in Turkey. From that they agreed they're going to exchange paper on ideas that get to a cease-fire. If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress. If those papers, on the other hand, have requirements in them that we know are unrealistic, then we'll have a different assessment. So, we're going to try to find that out. And there's a combination here. On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks, there has to be some progress, some movement forward. And if at the end of this, in the next few days, we get a document produced by both sides, and it shows that both sides are being- making concessions and being realistic and rational in their approach, then I think we can feel good about continuing to remain engaged. If, on the other hand, what we see is not very productive, perhaps we'll have a different assessment. I also agree that ultimately, one of the things that could help break this log jam, perhaps the only thing that can, is a direct- direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen, and- and hopefully that'll be worked out soon as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0You're planning on that?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, I don't know. We're- we're certainly made the offer. The president's made that offer already publicly. The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date. But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as- as feasible. I think the Russian side has also expressed a willingness to do it. And so, now it's just a question of bringing them- bringing everyone together, and figuring out where and when and that meeting will happen and what it will be about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, I- I want to move on to other topics. But lastly, your- your Senate- former senate colleague, Lindsey Graham, was next to you in that meeting with the Ukrainian foreign minister. He has a- he has a veto-proof majority on this bill to put sanctions on Russia. How quickly do you want the option for more sanctions on Russia? Or are you asking him to wait?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, we're not- look, the Senate is going to act, ultimately. I mean, I think in the past, we've act- asked to give us a little time to see if we can make some progress on our talks. But we've also been pretty clear with the Russian side for weeks now, going back six or seven weeks. We've been communicating to the Russian side that this effort was- was being undertaken. That we anticipated that when all was said and done, it would have close to 80 cosponsors in the Senate, and I imagine a comparable percentage of support in the House, that that was an effort we couldn't stop and don't control, that ultimately, Congress and particularly the Republicans in the House and Senate, have tried to give the president space and time to negotiate something here. But we've- we've advised the Russians repeatedly now for almost two months that this was coming if no progress was made. So I think that's just coming to fruition now. And it's one of the- one of the things that I confirmed, again, being with Lindsey Graham this week in Turkey, is they're now up to 77. He thinks they could get close to 80 or more. And that's just- that's just a fact, and something we've told the Russians about for weeks was coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to another part of the world. You've been very involved in the administration's efforts to crack down on this Venezuelan gang, TdA, that has been designated as a terror group by the U.S. Do you accept the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang is not a proxy force of the Maduro government? That was the National Intelligence Council assessment.",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Yeah, that's their assessment. They're wrong. In fact, the FBI agrees with me that they are. We- we- the FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago. So one of the warnings out there by the FBI is not simply that Tren de Aragua are- are a terrorist organization, but one that has already been operationalized, to murder a- to murder a- an- an opposition member in another country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a different thing than being a proxy force controlled by the Maduro government. Part of this is at the heart of the legal arguments the administration is having over its ability to continue to deport suspected gang members. That's why this assessment is so key. You completely reject that intelligence--",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 There- there--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --community finding?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Yeah, I agree 100 percent with the FBI's finding. This is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country. A prison gang that, in some cases, they've been in cooperation- and by the way, Tren de Aragua members that have been returned to Venezuela on some of these planes that have gone back have been greeted like heroes at the airport. So we have no doubt, I have no doubt and the FBI has made clear, I mean, this is the gang that they hired in order to- to murder an opposition member in another country. So they- they- there's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 South Africa's president is traveling to the United States this week to meet with President Trump. The administration has prioritized bringing some white South Africans, Afrikaners, to the United States, despite the increased restrictions on refugees. President Trump claims there's a genocide underway in South Africa. That's a legal determination, the State Department would make it. Are you trying to determine that now?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. You can- they can call it whatever they want, but these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and, in some cases, killed. These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of- of refuge. I- we've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. I think people should be celebrating it, and I think people should be supporting it--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well is there evidence--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: If in fact as many claim, they are in favor--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --of a genocide that you have?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties, both by the government, in some cases because of a law they passed, but also because of independent groups encouraged by political parties inside of South- inside of South Africa. So, listen, to move here from half a world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --especially people who have spent generations farming their land and developing their property. That's not something that you take lightly and do. These people are doing it for a reason. So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We will stand by to see if that determination of genocide is made. I want to ask you about the Middle East. The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding this ground operation inside of Gaza, the IDF says is to seize strategic areas. Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 We expand the destruction of Hamas, the ending of Hamas. We support a future for the people of Gaza that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. That's what we support. And this is a group that came across on October 7 and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, rapes, murders and hostage taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support. Now that said, we also support an end of the conflict, a cease-fire. We don't want people obviously suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but nonetheless, they're suffering. And so we are actively engaged, even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some cease-fire type mechanism. We're not going to do anything to undermine Israel and its security, but by the same token, if there is a possibility here to find a way forward that frees more hostages, including those who are alive, but also the bodies to their relatives, and potentially bring about an end to this war in a way that puts the people of Gaza on a pathway of peace and prosperity and being free of Hamas, we're going to explore that. We think we've made some progress, but there's more work to be done. Ambassador Witkoff is working on that on an hourly basis. It's something we're all very focused on and continue to be very supportive of. And I hope we'll have good news soon in that regard, but I think some impediments remain.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you asking Israel to slow down this military push? And the Qatari prime minister told Fox News that there was a deal being put together for all hostages, or many hostages, to be released after Edan Alexander, that American-Israeli was released recently, but then the Israeli military bombed a hospital, killing 70 civilians, and everything went sideways. Is that your understanding of what happened--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I would say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --it was this lack of care of collateral damage?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, I- the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately. And Israel's made that clear, it can end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones. If they did that, this conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer. That said, we continue to work and do everything we can through diplomatic channels and private means to bring about an end to this conflict in a way that ends Hamas and provides the people of Gaza the opportunity at a prosperous and peaceful future that also ensures Israel's security. So we're working on that, and we've never stopped working on that. We've never stopped taking efforts to make that possible. And that continues. Even as I speak to you now, there are people working on that. So we're going to continue to do that and that's the outcome we want to see. And hopefully, the sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the president has said Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't want to end the war. So the views are quite--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think what the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in contrast.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah- no- what the president's- no, no. I think what the president is saying is he doesn't want to end the war until Hamas is defeated. This is a group that is a threat- if an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire. And that is the view of- there is no future. There can be no peaceful and prosperous Gaza as long as Hamas governs it by rule of arms. And that's a- that's a fundamental truth. Now that doesn't mean that there isn't some way that we can achieve that through a cease-fire and some peace mechanism, and that's what we're trying to accomplish here. Ending Hamas, ending its governance of Gaza, ending the conflict, freeing all of the hostages, including the bodies of those who have passed away and been killed and murdered by the Hamas terrorists, and then beginning the work of a future for Gaza and also of ensuring Israel's security. That's always been our goal. That remains our goal, and that's what we continue to be focused on. But in the absence of that such agreement, we anticipate that, you know, Israel will continue forward with their operations. But that doesn't mean we stopped working on trying to achieve a peaceful outcome that also protects Israel's security and ends Hamas's governance of Gaza, so that Gaza can have a free and prosperous future moving forward. That's what the president wants to see as the end goal here. That is the end goal, and that's what we're working on through every means at our disposal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that Iran is, in your view, a threshold nuclear state, and we're at a critical moment. The U.S. and Iran are talking again. Can you clarify what the U.S. policy is here? Is the bottom line that Iran cannot enrich any uranium, even if it is at low levels for civilian purposes? Do they need to fully dismantle the program?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, if you're able to enrich at any level you've now are basically able to enrich at weapons grade very quickly. I mean, that's just a fundamental fact, and everyone knows it, and that was the problem with the Obama deal. But the end goal here is simple, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president's preference, because he doesn't like war, the president's preference is to achieve that through a peaceful negotiation. In fact, the president's preference is not- not only that Iran not pursue nuclear weapons, but that Iran be a rich, peaceful and prosperous country where its people can be happy. He wants them to have a better future. He has said this, he's a builder, not a bomber. That's what he views himself as, and that's what he is. He's a president that wants peace, and so he's offered that route, and that's one we hope the Iranians will take. But he's been very clear, Iran is never going to have the capability. They're never going to have a nuclear weapon. It's not going to happen. And we hope that that is achieved, that outcome is achieved through peaceful, diplomatic means, and that's what we're engaged on. We're not going to negotiate it in the media, because it makes it difficult to get an outcome. But that is the ultimate goal here, is to have an Iran that does not have a nuclear weapon or the ability to threaten its neighbors, particularly Israel.",

As a nation, our character is our fate. And so what I'm trying to do is convince people to start a national conversation on character with the idea it starts at the bottom, not at the top. We need to start it down where things actually happen, on farms, in schools. We've just sent out 240 copies of the book to college sports coaches to try to have them start just to talk about character. And so that's what I'm passionate about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I admire the effort. You know, it's interesting to look at where this began, not pinning it on a person. I understand you're trying to do that. But is it a symptom of, it's always been this way we just have more transparency, and thus we know more about people's flaws? Why does this seem to be building as a problem?",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Well, we've always had a problem with certain evil in society and corruption, lack of character, but I think the fact that we see everything so much now we normalize it. We start to accept things in celebrities or leaders that I frankly think we wouldn't have accepted even a generation ago. And that's sort of our problem. We give them our likes on social media, we spend our money with them, we vote for them, and we know better than that. And so I think the responsibility, again, arcs back to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not a Democrat or Republican you say.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Though you did endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris--",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Right--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --In the last elections. Most retired military try to stay out of politics and make an argument that that's crossing the rubicon in some ways.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you?",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Well, of course, you go back to Dwight Eisenhower and Ulysses S. Grant, they actually went into politics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fair.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: So there is some tradition, but that was not my goal to get into politics. I just felt that we had hit a period in which we were so adrift as a nation in terms of character, we were accepting something that is not as good as we are capable of. So I made a decision, and I'll be honest, it was tough, because there's a lot of pushback from peers and from outsiders that say you shouldn't get political. But I don't think that saying that America should stand up for its values and for its character is necessarily political.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we had, in the past, conversations with other guests that question about what does America stand for, and does it matter. There is a shift more towards pragmatism, or what's in it for me, on the national scale. That's very much in our politics right now.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: And I think it's a mistake for the nation. If you think what really helped the United States in the modern era, we'll call it after World War II, people admired American ideas. They admired American democracy. They admired our social, our culture. They didn't like every part of it, and they knew that we as a nation made mistakes, but countries and people wanted to be more like us than they wanted to be like the Soviet Union or other enemies. And as long as we are an example that people want to be, it gives us extraordinary influence and power. When it becomes transactional, when we, when we become somebody that just wants something from them, and we're unwilling to be generous, we're unwilling to sacrifice for larger ideals, we lose some of our moral standing and I think some of our national force, our power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the Pentagon right now, we hear a lot about values and culture sort of being at odds with the mission.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or that's how it's being described, right? Secretary Hegseth has talked a lot about restoring the warrior ethos. That's part of his justification for eliminating diversity programs or DEI. Do you think DEI really \"hurts lethality\"?",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: Yeah. I am completely aligned with Secretary Hegseth on the idea that we need to defend the nation, that the defense department needs to be as effective as it can be, and that a certain warrior ethos matters. We just define it differently. In my experience, we tend to understand that everybody can contribute, particularly in today's modern wars. The idea that everybody's got to look a certain way, got to have biceps of a certain size, there's got to be a male, straight, all these things, is not my experience. In the counter terrorist fight, where much of my experience was, it became a meritocracy. You didn't care what somebody looked like or how old they were, what their gender was or sexual orientation because it was too important to get the job done. And I would argue now America needs to harness talent from every corner of our society, everyone. I would even argue that if we went back to a draft, we could draft people with physical disabilities because much of what we do, that's not a block to that. And so I think we need to think about what do we need to field the most effective armed forces, and I think that the DEI thing is, frankly, a distraction. It's not helpful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of national character, when you were commanding forces, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, you know very well that country. The Taliban's since taken over. We have seen them strip women and girls of even the right to have their voice heard in public. You have seen them carry out retribution against Afghans who worked with our country and put their lives at risk. This past week, the Trump administration said Afghanistan is safe enough for people living here to go back. They stripped the legal protections, the Temporary Protected Status. They are ending some of the programs that helped to evacuate our American allies there. What do you think that says about our character now?",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: I think it's disappointing. I personally disagree with that decision, but I also think it sends a message. What about people who we ask to ally with us in the future, that we asked to partner with us, they look at what happened in the past. And so I think our national character should be bigger than that and we're capable of being bigger than that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General McChrystal, thank you very much for sharing your reflections.",
      "GEN. MCCHRYSTAL: You're kind to have me. Thank you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Bridget Brink, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 18, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, Ambassador Bridget Brink resigned from her post as America's top diplomat to Ukraine, and last week, she explained why. Though she had been serving as a career diplomat for three decades, Brink wrote in the Detroit Free Press she could, quote, 'no longer in good faith carry out the administration's policy,' accusing President Trump and his team of putting pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. For more, we're joined now by Ambassador Brink. Ambassador, good to have you here.",
      "AMBASSADOR BRIDGET BRINK: Hi, Margaret, thanks so much for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You served this country for so many decades. What happened that made you say, 'I can't take it'?",
      "AMB. BRINK: Well, maybe let me give you a little context. What I saw in Ukraine was horrifying. For three years, Russia launched missiles and drones at men, women and children sleeping in their homes, tried to take down the energy grid for millions of Ukrainians, to take out the power, heat and light in the middle of winter, and committed war crimes and atrocities at a level we haven't seen since World War Two. I resigned from Ukraine and also from the Foreign Service, because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all. It's appeasement and as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear, you are a career diplomat, so that means you serve regardless of who is the president of the United States and what party they come from. And in fact, when you tried to leave post in January, Secretary Rubio asked you to stay on in Kyiv, as I understand it, you were there for a number of months until April. What specifically with this policy is a problem for you? Because you did. You worked at post under the Trump administration. Was there a trigger that made you say we're getting it so wrong?",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: Well, I would say it wasn't a hard, a hasty, rash decision. It was one that I took over the first three months of the administration. But the first sign was the Oval Office meeting in February, in February, President Trump and President Zelensky, where I saw that our approach is to put pressure on Ukraine and not pressure on Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President and this administration's policies, you have heard Secretary Rubio say is just to try to get the fighting to stop. Do you see that America has leverage here?",
      "AMB. BRINK: Yes, of course we have leverage-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Russia?",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: Yes, of course we do. I mean, we're the leader in- of the free world. I think let's just be clear, Russia and Putin have invaded a sovereign, independent, democratic country in the heart of Europe, with the help of North Korea, Iran and China. This is fundamentally against U.S. interests Europe as our largest trading partner, is responsible for 16 million jobs on both continents, and having this war or any festering, unresolved war on the margins of Europe, is very bad for the United States. So what do we need to do as the United States? We need to put together with partners and allies, pressure on Russia to end the war. And there are many ways to do this. We can put additional sanctions in the energy sector, in the banking sector. Russia is not as strong as some people say, or some people think. The economy is hurting. They have 20 percent interest rates- 21 percent interest rates, 10 percent inflation. And so right now is the time to increase the pressure on Russia, to bring Putin to the table, not decrease it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we know that President Trump and President Putin have plans to speak on Monday, when you were still in Kyiv. President Zelenskyy called out the U.S. Embassy for what he called a disappointingly weak reaction from America following a missile attack that killed small children. He said, you must not be afraid to call things by their names, and the U.S. is afraid to even say the word Russian when speaking about the missile that murdered children. Do you feel American officials are being censored from saying things frankly and honestly?",
      "AMB. BRINK: I mean, our job as diplomats is to reflect and represent the policy of the the President and the administration. That's our job. That's- that's what we do as professionals and having worked for five different presidents that requires reflecting that policy that's made constitutionally by the President. So to me, the real question is, how are we going to help to end this war in a way that's in the interest of the United States? And to do that, it can't be peace at any price. It has to be a peace that does things that advance our own interests, and those are really simple. It's how to keep Ukraine free, how to deter Russia, and how to send the right signal to China. And this is what we should be doing. And every step that we make in diplomacy, I think should try to help achieve this goal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And call things what they are.",
      "AMB. BRINK: It's important for us, as a leader of the free world- again, to be clear and accurate, and also, I think it's an important moment in history. We've seen the devastation that happens when we appease aggressors, and we do not want to do that again. So my strong advice in terms of how to deal with Putin and Russia is not to give a single meeting or concession or legitimacy until Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire that's verifiable and moves forward toward a just and lasting peace. On that basis, I can see a conversation and diplomacy that can achieve our interests.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the State Department, we have seen plans from Secretary Rubio to make some dramatic changes, and- and these are the professionals who would be advising the Secretary and the President in some way on these policies. He's going to close 132 offices, consolidate bureaus, he's going to cut about 15 percent of staff, he says. Eliminate offices. What do you think the impact will be on making the right decision when you have these changes? Is all of this helping our foreign policy or is this hurting the ability to shape it?",
      "AMB. BRINK: I mean, again, having worked for five presidents, every new administration comes in with a set of goals, and our job as professional civil service was to execute and implement those goals to the best of our ability. I believe that cutting the State Department in ways that take away our diplomatic power does not help us achieve American interests, and there are key parts of the State Department that- that ensure our security broader than simply security from the defense side. There's cyber security, there's fight against disinformation, there's ensuring that there's free media and free press. That's all that we do as part of the State Department. So I think how we do it really matters. And my concern would be, as many people have said, If you don't fully fund the State Department, you need a bigger military budget. Because what we do- and we do it in small, sometimes quiet and unknown ways, is we help prevent wars. We help to open markets to U.S. businesses. We help American citizens when they're hurt or injured overseas. We play a very important role that's not necessarily the most public role, but I think this is a critical role to American foreign policy and national interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And do it often in war zones far away from your family, as you did for many years. Thank you very much, Ambassador Brink, for sharing your insights with us. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 18, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Good morning and good to have you here.",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Good to be here, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We just showed some reporting from our colleague, Debora Patta, with incredible pictures from our- our shooter inside of Gaza, Marwan. It's hard to look at pictures of children in that level of starvation. You have said the Israeli government is starving civilians, and the U.S. is complicit in the gross violation of international law. The U.N.'s begging to go in. The Israeli government says they don't want to work with the U.N. here. They want to work with this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that's just being set up. What do you know about this? Should there be U.S. support for it?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: So Margaret, you're right. It's very hard to look at those pictures, and the United States has been complicit. President Trump was in the region and really did nothing, said virtually nothing about what's happening in Gaza, which is on- on fire. We're in 77th day of a full blockade. Two million Palestinians are starving. This is collective punishment that is clearly illegal under international law. And this other idea that's been cooked up, either by the Israelis or by the Trump administration, is clearly not fit for purpose when it comes to trying to address this burgeoning famine. And all it will do is further allow food to be used as a weapon of the war. So I hope the United States will back off this plan. None of the credible international organizations have said that they will participate because it violates, you know, international norms and how it's structured. And so I hope the United States will back off and immediately call today to allow the trucks right now that have food to be able to come, provide food to starving people. These are provided by international aid organizations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that the United States can do in terms of leverage? You were- you've been bipartisan in your criticism. You said that what happened in Gaza is a black stain on Joe Biden's legacy as president. You are criticizing the current administration for not doing more here. What leverage is there? I mean, is what you're saying falling on any ears that want to listen?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I've had conversations with some people in- in the Trump administration and made clear that they need to do more. One of the very obvious things they could do is President Trump today could call upon the Netanyahu government to let aid in. I mean, the President acknowledged there are people starving in Gaza the other day. He said so. But why hasn't he called on Netanyahu to let the aid in? Let's just start with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll follow the diplomacy that Steve Witkoff is leading. I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. The Treasury Secretary this morning, is dismissing the news that Moody's credit rating agency downgraded America's credit, the first time since 1917 now all three agencies have said the US fiscal situation is unsustainable. Moody specifically said the upcoming bills and spending reductions won't make a difference. You're an appropriator. You are in a position of power here. What is going to happen with Capitol Hill and the President's agenda? Is it going to be much of a fight? Is there going to be anyone pushing back because of this?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Oh, yes, Margaret. What you're seeing is the Republican plan, the Trump plan is essentially to give these huge tax cuts to very wealthy people and corporations at the expense of everybody else. They're going to cut Medicaid, they're going to cut food and nutrition programs, but even after those cuts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They say they are not, as you know--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: --but even- well, it's in their current House bill. They have $700 billion in Medicaid cuts and 300 billion in food nutrition programs in the House bill now. I mean, they can always change it. But even after that, they're going to- this will result in a huge spike in the national debt. And so that's why Moody's is warning people that we're going down this road, and it will have a direct harmful impact on every American, because what it will do is drive up interest rates. Right? Just like the Trump across-the-board tariffs are raising prices, so will these big deficits and debts they incur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moody's also says, though, that this has been cumulative, which means Democrats bear some responsibility for the situation we find ourselves in now.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Just on that point, I put forward a variety of plans to close tax loopholes for the very rich to begin to address the deficit problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of responsibility, I'm sure you've been tracking all the headlines and the conversation about President Biden and what happened with that debriefing of him by the Special Counsel Hur during that Justice Department investigation of his mishandling of classified information. No charges were brought, but the audio of that was obtained by Axios, and it- you hear the president halting at times. Remember Hur was the one who said President Biden was a sympathetic, well meaning, elderly man with a poor memory, and Democrats really pushed back at the time at that saying that sounded very political. In hindsight, do you think Democrats were too willing to look the other way?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, hindsight is 20/20. We know a lot more now than we knew then. I can just say personally, I had limited interactions with President Biden at the time. He came to the Key Bridge in Maryland when it collapsed, and we had a good conversation. So hindsight is 20/20. Obviously, if we could redo this tape and play it over again, we would do things differently.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like you have to explain and defend that now? I mean, there was a piece in The Washington Post from Dan Balz who said Democrats are either- were either covering up then or covering their behinds now.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No- well- look- I mean, I think we can acknowledge that this was a-\u00a0 people overlooked a serious problem or were just not aware.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Willingly?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't- I can only speak for myself. I didn't- I wasn't aware of this, but we are focused on the future right now. I mean, right- right now we have the Republican tax plan, which is a giveaway to the rich. We have- you know, we didn't talk about it, but Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, my view, is the overall narrative here was selling out US national interests for the private gain of his family business. He essentially gave away the crown jewels of American AI and semiconductor technology to the Gulf in exchange, in exchange, it looks like, for a $2 billion investment in the Trump family stablecoin venture.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another topic. But on this point, I hear you want to look forward. I do too. But don't Democrats have to reckon with this and say to the public that the answer to that question- you know?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN:\u00a0 I think we've all acknowledged that if we had the benefit of hindsight, we would have done things differently. I don't know if all of us have. I recognize that, but at this point, it seems to me, the American people are much more interested in the conversation as to the future of our country and the damage that Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your time today.",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the intelligence community is incorrect in its assessment that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government \u2014 an argument that has served as a justification for the Trump administration's swift deportation of suspected gang members.",
      "\"They're wrong,\" Rubio said of the intelligence community assessment on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The National Intelligence Council determined in a report that the Venezuelan government does not direct Tren de Aragua, contradicting the Trump administration's claims used to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, which gives it the power to swiftly remove migrants it identifies as members of the gang. The memo was released under the Freedom of Information Act following a request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "\"While Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,\" the report says.",
      "The question of whether the Maduro government controls Tren de Aragua is at the center of a clash over the Trump administration's ability to continue to deport suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. In a March proclamation, President Trump invoked the act, which had only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, treating suspected gang members like wartime enemies of the U.S. government. Mr. Trump had previously designated Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, along with MS-13 and other gangs and cartels.",
      "Shortly after the March proclamation was signed, the administration used the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 200 men, mostly Venezuelans, to a prison in El Salvador. An analysis by \"60 Minutes\" found that 75% of the Venezuelans deported had no criminal history.",
      "The move has sparked significant clashes with the federal courts, as the administration has pursued the swift apprehension and removal of Venezuelan nationals deemed alien enemies. On Friday, the Supreme Court said it would continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas while they pursue a challenge to their removals under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, maintaining an April directive.",
      "Last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired the two top officials who were leading the National Intelligence Council, Mike Collins, acting chair of National Intelligence Council, and his deputy, Maria Lagan-Riekhof, CBS News confirmed. NBC News reported those were the officials who oversaw the Tren de Aragua memo.",
      "Rubio refuted the National Intelligence Council report, while pointing to an FBI assessment that he said he agrees with. He outlined that not only is Tren de Aragua \"exported by the Venezuelan regime,\" but that there are warnings that it's also a terror organization that's \"already been operationalized\" to target an opposition member of another country.",
      "\"The FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago,\" Rubio said.",
      "Asked whether he completely rejects the intelligence community's findings, Rubio said he agrees \"100%\" with the FBI's findings. The FBI is overseen by the Trump administration's Justice Department.",
      "Rubio said \"this is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country,\" claiming that in some cases, \"they've been in cooperation.\" He added that suspected Tren de Aragua members who have been returned to Venezuela have been \"greeted like heroes\" at the airport.",
      "\"There's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile,\" Rubio said.",

      "The threat by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Mr. Trump's wrath. Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.",
      "In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.",
      "Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said he thinks $350 car seats made in China will soon cost an additional $100, a 29% price increase.",
      "\"We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,\" he told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first-quarter sales.",
      "Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of tariffs, as consumers curtail spending.",
      "The administration recently ratcheted down its 145% tariffs on China to 30% for a 90-day period. Trump has placed tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada due to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, harming the relationship with America's two largest trading partners.",
      "There is a universal baseline tariff of 10% for most countries as Trump promises to reach trade deals in the coming weeks, all while insisting he intends to preserve the tariffs as a revenue source. The framework agreement with the United Kingdom would largely keep the 10% tariff rate in place.",
      "Trump has also placed import taxes on autos, steel and aluminum and plans to do so on pharmaceutical drugs, among other products.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on the phone Saturday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to get a readout on the latest talks, as the U.S. tries to determine whether Russia is \"tapping us along\" in efforts to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"We talked about a variety of things,\" Rubio told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday. \"I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. They were not a complete waste of time.\"",
      "The phone call between the countries' top diplomats occurred a day after Moscow and Kyiv held the first direct talks in three years. Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey after he proposed direct negotiations and instead sent a lower-level delegation.",
      "The talks in Istanbul Friday broke up after fewer than two hours without a ceasefire, although both sides agreed on exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war each.",
      "The United States \u2014 along with its European allies \u2014 have been pushing Russia and Ukraine for an end to the three-year war. President Trump, who has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to stiffen American sanctions unless progress is made toward a peace deal, said Saturday he will be speaking with Putin by phone Monday. That call will be followed by one with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"Are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out,\" Rubio told Brennan when asked if Russia and Ukraine are seeking to talk to \"buy time.\" \"We'll find out pretty soon.\"",
      "He added, \"On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So, there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to.\"",
      "The secretary of state said he believes the only way that these talks will move forward is if Mr. Trump and Putin meet in person. He said Mr. Trump has publicly offered to meet one-on-one.",
      "\"The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date,\" Rubio said. \"But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible.\"",
      "The Vatican has made a \"very generous offer\" to host any peace talks. Rubio, who is in Rome to attend the Mass for the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV Sunday, said the Vatican would be a place that \"all parties would feel comfortable.\"",

      "Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, used his remarks at the University of Minnesota's law school commencement ceremony to call on graduates to stand up to abuses of power. Lawyers, he said, are \"our first and last line of defense.\"",
      "\"Right now, more than any other time in my lifetime, we need you to live up to the oath that you're about to make. Because, I have to be honest with you: You are graduating into a genuine emergency,\" Walz told the crowd, which greeted him with loud applause. \"Every single day, the president of the United States finds new ways to trample rights and undermine the rule of law.\"",
      "Walz pointed to Mr.\u00a0Trump's immigration crackdown, which includes deporting alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, questions about lack of due process and the offer of a gifted jet from the Qatari ruling family to the president.",
      "\"This is what the crumbling of rule of law looks like in real time. And it's exactly what the founders of this nation feared: A tyrant, abusing power to persecute scapegoats and enemies,\" he said.",
      "Since former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Mr. Trump in November, Democrats have been debating which direction to take the party amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that its leaders are failing to do enough to check the new administration.",
      "Walz is among a long list of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early voting states.",
      "Others include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who sharply criticized \"do-nothing\" Democrats last month for failing to oppose Mr. Trump. Pritzker, who is scheduled to headline a Minnesota Democratic dinner in June, drew attention in February when he used part of his joint budget and State of the State address to draw a parallel between Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced this week he will drop sanctions on Syria \u2014 surprising some senior U.S. sanctions officials, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

    "story": [
      "Combat sport clubs have been used to boost recruitment for a white nationalist hate group, according to a report released by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center.",
      "The report tracks the efforts of the Patriot Front \u2014 one of the most visible groups in the white nationalist movement, formed following the deadly 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 \u2014 and their focus on recruiting new members through Active Clubs.",
      "These clubs are smaller, looser networks of white supremacist groups, where members train in mixed martial arts. Through sport, they bond over white nationalist ideologies, SPLC said. The clubs also maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, the\u00a0report\u00a0said, to evade researchers and law enforcement.",
      "\"It serves as a way to hide some of the Patriot Front's movements,\" said Jeff Tischauser, the SPLC report's author and a researcher at the not-for-profit legal advocacy organization.",
      "Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S. \u2013 and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide. Since 2023, there has been a\u00a014% increase\u00a0in hate groups, according to the SPLC, which says it tracks 1,430 hate and antigovernment groups across the country.",
      "Active Clubs have had a presence since 2023 in at least 34 states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Kansas, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Florida,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Counter Extremism Project. The groups host training sessions, create propaganda videos and participate in demonstrations and flash rallies, according to experts. They push male supremacy ideology, share workout selfies and encourage each other to reach peak physicality in preparation for marches or possible future conflicts, experts say.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of Active Clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2021, Rundo began hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" where he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish their own clubs. He hawked what he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",
      "The shift to \"white nationalism 3.0\" is similar to leaderless resistance concepts across the far right ecosystem, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "\"I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,\" he said.",
      "Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting \"non-European\" members.",
      "\"Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?\" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report.",
      "The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was\u00a0ordered to pay\u00a0$2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a\u00a0settlement\u00a0was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners.",
      "Patriot Front has also faced scrutiny from within the right-wing movement. \"In some sections of this larger far right, Patriot Front is branded as federal agents,\" Tischauser said. \"So to avoid that accusation, they use Active Clubs and start trying to groom people into Patriot Front membership from there.\"",
      "The conspiracy theory even gained enough traction on social media to reach Elon Musk. Last year, he posted on\u00a0X, \"This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?\" in reaction to a post of Patriot Front members being detained, where an X user dubbed the group \"Fed Front.\"",
      "The conspiracy that FBI agents pose as right-wing activists goes beyond Patriot Front. A Washington Post-University of Maryland\u00a0poll\u00a0found that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The FBI said in a statement to CBS News Saturday, \"The FBI investigates individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and other criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Patriot Front's founder and leader, Thomas Rosseau, via email.",
      "Lewis said that there has been a mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs once confined to neo-Nazi forums and considered to be fringe.",
      "\"Today, you have the richest man in the world,\u00a0members of Congress\u00a0tweeting this out, as if it's like a real thing that's happening,\" Lewis said. \"That just broadens out the aperture of disaffected young, predominantly white men who are looking for someone to blame, something to blame.\"",
      "Since these clubs are scattered, unaffiliated entities, Patriot Front has faced challenges in its recruitment efforts.",

    "story": [
      "Snippets from a 2023 interview that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe former President Joe Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" were obtained and published by Axios Friday, showing Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the audio matches the transcript of the interview released by the Biden White House in 2024.",
      "In one four-minute clip, Biden was asked by Hur's team \u2014 which was investigating Biden's handling of classified records \u2014 about where he kept his documents shortly after leaving office as vice president. Biden's response is marked by long pauses, and his voice appears hoarse at times. His speech is especially halting as he describes the period around his son Beau's death.",
      "In the audio obtained by news outlet Axios, Biden can also be heard struggling to remember the year when Beau died or the year when President Trump was first elected. Members of his staff can be heard correcting him or reminding him of the date.",
      "A written transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year, but portions of the audio released Friday provide context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems at certain points in the session.",
      "In response to the audio, Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS News in a statement, \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",
      "Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report. The special counsel wrote in February 2024 that Biden sounded like a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur said it's a view jurors may share, making it hard to convict Biden of knowingly holding sensitive documents at his home and office. Hur's report noted \"significant limitations\" to Biden's memory, including his difficulty remembering when his son died.",
      "Hur recommended against charging Biden with a crime, though he did conclude that Biden \"willfully\" retained government documents.",
      "At the time, Biden and his allies reacted furiously to Hur's report \u2014 especially the \"elderly man with a poor memory\" line and the comment about Beau Biden's death.",
      "\"There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business,\" Biden said last year. \"I don't need anyone to tell me when he passed away.\"",
      "Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer called the report a \"shabby piece of work\" filled with \"totally inappropriate and pejorative comments.\" The Biden White House counsel's office asked Hur's team to revise the report, calling its references to Biden's memory \"inflammatory.\"",
      "The report was released as concerns swirled about Biden's age and fitness to run for another term, though at the time, Democratic officials publicly backed Biden and slammed Hur. Republicans, meanwhile, cited the report as evidence of Biden's fading cognitive abilities and pushed for audio of the interview to be released. Biden was 80 years old at the time of Hur's interview.",
      "But months later, Biden's rocky June debate against Mr. Trump \u2014 in which he repeatedly struggled to complete his sentences \u2014 reignited worries about his age, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race amid pressure from his party.",
      "Biden's decisions during that period have drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, as books that offer glimpses inside his campaign hit the shelves. Some of the books describe Biden's struggles with age, his aides' maneuvers to keep him in the race and the abrupt shift from Biden to eventual nominee Kamala Harris weeks after the Trump-Biden debate.",

      "Mr. Trump posted \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" last fall, days after the singer endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris. Swift's Eras tour was still in progress at the time. The post was quickly overshadowed by news of a second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump hours later.",
      "It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Trump's mid-air musing about Swift. The pop megastar has been keeping a lower public profile in recent weeks. Her Eras tour has ended, and boyfriend Travis Kelce's football season is over. Swift fans caught a glimpse of her at a Mother's Day brunch in Philadelphia with the Kelce family, but she's been photographed less frequently, except for the occasional date night, since the Kansas City Chiefs lost their Super Bowl bid.",

During the trip, Mr. Trump met with allied Arab leaders, pledged to drop sanctions against Syria in a surprise move and announced a set of economic deals with Gulf states. Shortly before the trip started, reports emerged that Qatar would donate a Boeing 747 for Mr. Trump's use, drawing ethics concerns \u2014 though Mr. Trump defended the move.",
      "The bad blood between Swift and the president extends back years. Swift has only occasionally waded into politics, but has endorsed Mr. Trump's opponents twice, backing former President Joe Biden in 2020 and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. Last year, she suggested she endorsed Harris in part because Mr. Trump had shared images on Truth Social that implied Swift supported him.",
      "In endorsing Harris, Swift said she was \"a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"",
      "Swift also endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in his unsuccessful 2018 race against Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, whom Swift called \"Trump in a wig\" in a documentary released in early 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Former FBI Director James Comey has provoked an outcry from the Trump administration after he briefly posted a photo to Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against President Trump \u2014 a claim Comey pushed back on.",
      "Comey was interviewed Friday by Secret Service agents investigating the post at their field office in Washington, D.C., two officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The interview wrapped at approximately 7 p.m. ET, roughly 90 minutes after it was slated to begin, two sources familiar said.",
      "The image shared by Comey \u2014 a longtime Trump foe \u2014 showed seashells in sand arranged to form the numbers \"86 47,\" according to screenshots shared by Trump administration officials.",
      "He did not make his meaning clear, but administration officials and some of his supporters interpreted the numbers as referring to Mr. Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term \"eighty-six,\" which has often been used to mean \"eject\" or \"remove.\"",
      "Comey later deleted the image. In a follow-up Instagram post Thursday night, Comey wrote that he \"posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\"",

      "Noem says post is under investigation",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X\u00a0Thursday that the issue is under investigation. She said Comey \"just called for the assassination\" of Mr. Trump, and added her agency and the Secret Service are \"investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.\"",
      "In a post Friday night on X, Noem confirmed that Secret Service agents had interviewed Comey, writing, in part: \"I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump. This is an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Current FBI Director Kash Patel said in a separate statement that, \"We are aware of the recent tweet by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump. We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director (Sean) Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\"",
      "A Secret Service spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday it \"vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich wrote in his own social media post Comey's message \"can clearly be interpreted as 'a hit' on the sitting President of the United States,\" and said it is \"being taken seriously.\"",
      "Trump responds",
      "In an interview with Fox News, the president claimed Comey knew \"exactly what that meant\" when he posted the image on Instagram. \"That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,\" Mr. Trump told Fox's Bret Baier. He also called the post \"a terrible thing\" and Comey a \"dirty cop.\"",

      "That firing ultimately set into motion Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\"",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "Mr. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidential campaign last year. During a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet. One rally attendee was killed and two more were wounded.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-one-big-beautiful-bill-impact-by-income-group/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress. If those papers, on the other hand, have requirements in them that we know are unrealistic, then we'll have a different assessment.",
      "On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward.",
      "Ultimately, one of the things that could help break this logjam, perhaps the only thing that can, is a direct \u2013 direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen. And \u2013 and, hopefully, that'll be worked out soon as well.",

      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date.",
      "But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as \u2013 as feasible. I think the Russian side has also expressed a willingness to do it. And so now it's just a question of bringing them \u2013 bringing everyone together and figuring out where and when.",

      "But we've also been pretty clear with the Russian side for weeks now, going back six or seven weeks. We've been communicating to the Russian side that this effort was \u2013 was being undertaken, that we anticipated that, when all was said and done, it would have close to 80 co-sponsors in the Senate, and I imagine a comparable percentage of support in the House, that that was an effort we couldn't stop and don't control.",

      "Do you accept the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang is not a proxy force of the Maduro government? That was the National Intelligence Council assessment.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, that's their assessment. They're wrong.",
      "One of the warnings out there by the FBI is not simply that Tren de Aragua are \u2013 are a terrorist organization, but one that has already been operationalized to murder a \u2013 to murder a \u2013 an \u2013 an opposition member in another country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a different thing than being a proxy force controlled by the Maduro government. Part of this is at the heart of the legal arguments the administration is having over its ability to continue to deport suspected gang members.",
      "That's why this assessment is so key. You completely reject that intelligence community finding?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They're \u2013 they're \u2013 yes, I agree 100 percent with the FBI's finding.",
      "This is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country, a prison gang that in some cases they've been in cooperation with. And, by the way, Tren de Aragua members that have been returned to Venezuela on some of these planes that have gone back have been greeted like heroes at the airport.",
      "There's no doubt in our mind and in my mind and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile.",

      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. You can \u2013 they can call it whatever they want, but these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and in some cases killed.",
      "These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of \u2013 of refuge. I \u2013 we've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad.",
      "Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. I think people should be celebrating it, and I think people should be supporting it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, is there evidence of a genocide that you have?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: If, in fact, as many claim, they are in favor \u2013 I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties, both by the government in some cases because of a law they passed, but also because of independent groups encouraged by political parties inside of South \u2013 inside of South Africa.",
      "So, listen, to move here from half-a-world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly. These people are doing it for a reason. So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding this ground operation inside of Gaza. The IDF says it's to seize strategic areas. Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war?",

      "And this is a group that came across on October 7 and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, rapes, murders and hostage- taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support.",
      "Now, that said, we also support an end of the conflict, a cease-fire. We don't want people obviously suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but, nonetheless, they're suffering. And so we are actively engaged. Even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some cease-fire-type mechanism.",
      "Ambassador Witkoff is working on that on an hourly basis. It's something we're all very focused on and continue to be very supportive of. And I hope we'll have good news soon in that regard, but I think some impediments remain.",

      "Is that your understanding of what happened?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I would say that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was this lack of care of collateral damage?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I \u2013 the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately. And Israel's made that clear. It can end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones.",
      "If they did that, this conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer.",

      "The U.S. and Iran are talking again. Can you clarify what the U.S. policy is here? Is the bottom line that Iran cannot enrich any uranium, even if it is at low levels for civilian purposes? Do they need to fully dismantle the program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, if you're able to enrich at any level, you now are basically able to enrich at weapons grade very quickly. I mean, that's just a fundamental fact, and everyone knows it, and that was the problem with the Obama deal.",
      "But the end goal here is simple. Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president's preference \u2013 because he doesn't like war, the president's preference is to achieve that through a peaceful negotiation.",
      "He's a builder, not a bomber. That's what he views himself as, and that's what he is. He's a president that wants peace, and so he's offered that route. And that's one we hope the Iranians will take.",
      "But he's been very clear. Iran is never going to have the capability. They're never going to have a nuclear weapon. It's not going to happen.",

      "DEBORA PATTA: Since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped up the war in Gaza this past week, close to 500 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "(voice-over): For Palestinians, it is more of what they have endured with little respite for over 19 months, relentless bombing in areas mostly reduced to rubble, a death toll that has seen dozens killed almost every day this week, Israeli orders to evacuate, forcing Palestinians to pack up and move once again with no idea where they are heading to.",
      "More than two-thirds of Gaza has been declared a military no-go zone. The rest is not much safer. Israel has imposed a total aid blockade. For more than 75 days, it has stopped all food and medicine from entering the territory, saying it is to force Hamas to hand over the remaining hostages.",
      "Hunger is so rife that famine is once again stalking Gaza, according to the World Food Program's Antoine Renard, who's just returned from there.",
      "ANTOINE RENARD (World Food Program): You have around an estimated 14,000 children that are now facing what we call severe acute malnutrition.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We just showed some reporting from our colleague Debora Patta with incredible pictures from our shooter inside of Gaza, Marwan.",
      "It's hard to look at pictures of children in that level of starvation. You have said: \"The Israeli government is starving civilians and the U.S. is complicit in the gross violation of international law.\"",
      "The U.N. is begging to go in. The Israeli government says they don't want to work with the U.N. here. They want to work with this Gaza humanitarian foundation that's just being set up.",
      "What do you know about this? Should there be U.S. support for it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, Margaret, you're right. It's very hard to look at those pictures. And the United States has been complicit. President Trump was in the region and really did nothing, said virtually nothing about what's happening in Gaza, which is on fire.",
      "We're in the 77th day of a full blockade. Two million Palestinians are starving. This is collective punishment that is clearly illegal under international law. And this other idea that's been cooked up either by the Israelis or by the Trump administration is clearly not fit for purpose when it comes to trying to address this burgeoning famine. And all it will do is further allow food to be used as a weapon of war.",
      "So, I hope the United States will back off this plan. None of the credible international organizations have said that they will participate, because it violates international norms in how it's structured. And so I hope the United States will back off and immediately call today to allow the trucks right now that have food to be able to come provide food to starving people.",
      "These are provided by international aid organizations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that the United States can do in terms of leverage? You were \u2013 you have been bipartisan in your criticism. You said that what happened in Gaza is a black stain on Joe Biden's legacy as president. You are criticizing the current administration for not doing more here.",
      "What leverage is there? I mean, is what you're saying falling on any ears that want to listen?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I have had conversations with some people in the Trump administration and made clear that they need to do more.",
      "One of the very obvious things they could do is, President Trump today could call upon the Netanyahu government to let aid in. I mean, the president acknowledged there are people starving in Gaza the other day. He said so. But why hasn't he called on Netanyahu to let the aid in?",
      "Let's just start with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will follow the diplomacy that Steve Witkoff is leading.",
      "I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. The treasury secretary this morning is dismissing the news that Moody's credit rating agency downgraded America's credit. It's like the first time since 1917. Now all three agencies have said the U.S. fiscal situation is unsustainable.",
      "Moody's specifically said the upcoming bills and spending reductions won't make a difference. You're an appropriator. You are in a position of power here. What is going to happen with Capitol Hill and the president's agenda? Is it going to be much of a fight? Is there going to be anyone pushing back because of this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Oh, yes, Margaret, what you're seeing is, the Republican plan, the Trump plan is essentially to give these huge tax cuts to very wealthy people and corporations, at the expense of everybody else.",
      "They're going to cut Medicaid. They're going to cut food and nutrition programs. But even after those cuts\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they're not, as you know.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: But even \u2013 well, it's in their current House bill. They have $700 billion in Medicaid cuts and $300 billion in food and nutrition programs in the House bill now. I mean, they can always change it.",
      "But, even after that, they're going to \u2013 this will result in a huge spike in the national debt. And so that's why Moody's is warning people that we're going down this road. And it will have a direct harmful impact on every American, because what it will do is drive up interest rates, right?",
      "Just like the Trump across-the-board tariffs are raising prices, so will these big deficits and debts they incur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moody's also says, though, that this has been cumulative, which means Democrats bear some responsibility for the situation we find ourselves in now.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: But just on that point\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: \u2026 I have put forward a variety of plans to close tax loopholes for the very rich to begin to address the deficit problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of responsibility, I'm sure you have been tracking all the headlines and the conversation about President Biden and what happened with that debriefing of him by the special counsel Hur during that Justice Department investigation of his mishandling of classified information.",
      "No charges were brought, but the audio of that was obtained by Axios. In it, you hear the president halting at times. Remember, Hur was the one who said President Biden was a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.",
      "And Democrats really pushed back at the time at that, saying that sounded very political. In hindsight, do you think Democrats were too willing to look the other way?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, hindsight is 20/20. We know a lot more now than we knew then.",
      "I can just say, personally, I had limited interactions with President Biden at the time. He came to the Key Bridge in Maryland when it collapsed, and we had a good conversation. So hindsight is 20/20. Obviously, if we could redo this tape and play it over again, we would do things differently.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like you have to explain and defend that now? I mean, there was a piece in \"The Washington Post\" from Dan Balz who said Democrats are either \u2013 were either covering up then or covering their behinds now.",

I think they put themselves in a position, if they chose to do so, to put essentially a stranglehold around Taiwan in terms of shipping and so on.",

And what we are facing today, we've never faced as a country, is a country that's almost as rich as we are that is technologically advanced competing with us in many areas of technology, technology advances, and \u2013 and one that has unanswered ambitions, unfulfilled ambitions\u2026",

      "The actions of Israel post the October 7th massacre by Hamas has really changed the strategic equation in the Middle East because Iran has been dramatically weakened. Iran's in a very weak place now. And if there is an opportunity to do a deal on nuclear, this is it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't really like the Obama era nuclear deal with Iran. Now, President Trump is trying something that may be somewhat similar. What do you think has to be in it for it to really be a success?",

      "ROBERT GATES: Entirely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not just highly enriched? All enriched?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you oppose an Israeli strike with U.S. support on Iran's nuclear program?",
      "ROBERT GATES: The problem that I've had with a strike on the Iranian nuclear program is that it buys you a year or two. You're not going to be able to (INAUDIBLE). Short of \u2013 as long as you're using conventional weapons, you cannot get at the very deeply buried parts of the Iranian nuclear program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're starting to see some points of friction with the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government in particular. Are \u2013 are we at the point now where President Trump needs to publicly be clear that the war in Gaza has to end and withhold U.S. support if it doesn't?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I think it would be a very heavy political lift for the president to say he's going to cut off military supplies to Israel unless they stop in Gaza. I think he can say a lot of things in terms of putting pressure on Netanyahu to stop the war. He can put forward proposals on how humanitarian assistance and other things might \u2013 might go forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Rubio said he believes that there won't be a clear read on Vladimir Putin's intentions until he sits down with President Donald Trump. You've met Putin before. Does it really take a face to face to judge Putin's intentions?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I'm not sure even in a face to face that you can judge Putin's intentions. My \u2013 my own view is, Putin feels that he has a destiny to recreate the Russian empire. Putin hasn't given up on any of his original goals in Ukraine. He's going to insist on occupying all four of the eastern provinces of the Donbas, perpetual recognition of Russian ownership of Crimea, a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and a \u2013 a Ukrainian military that looks a lot like an enhanced police force. He wants Ukraine basically to be a client state of Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you advise President Trump not to take that face to face, even if Vladimir Putin was willing to do it?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I would say you need to figure out some leverage that you have going into this meeting with Putin. What can you do that puts more pressure to bear on Putin, to make him believe his \u2013 his interests are served by, not just a ceasefire, but a \u2013 basically at least freezing things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How sustainable do you think it is for the secretary of state to also be the national security advisor, the acting archivist and the acting director of USAID?",
      "ROBERT GATES: It's interesting. A lot of people point to the precedent when Henry Kissinger was secretary of state and national security advisor from 1973 to 1975. I was at the NSC during most of that period. And all I can tell you is, Henry Kessinger was an absentee landlord. I mean what made it work in that time was that Henry had a very experienced and wise deputy in General Brent Scowcroft. And Scowcroft essentially ran the NSC day to day. And Henry would appear now and then. But \u2013 but mainly did his secretary of state job.",
      "So, whether or not this will work, I think, depends on whether the secretary of state has a deputy at the NSC who is very experienced, knows the inner agency and \u2013 and \u2013 and is respected and trusted by the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With this president, I've heard from officials, which is he does not trust National Security Council because of the history with the first impeachment. So, he is suspect of a lot of people who sit there. What's the danger of that when you don't trust the people who are briefing you on some of the most sensitive national security issues, or advising you?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I think it's important to \u2013 for people to remember, the NSC is the president's personal foreign policy staff. So, I think if \u2013 if people on the NSC \u2013 and I don't care whether they come from the State Department or CIA or the military or anyplace else, or from the outside. On that staff, if you can't be loyal to the president, then you should leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean loyal?",
      "ROBERT GATES: I mean be willing \u2013 embrace his policies and do what you can to implement those policies and to ensure that the other agencies are implementing the president's policies. And when the time comes, if the time comes that you disagree with those policies, then, it seems to me, it's incumbent on you to return to your agency or to leave the government.",
      "I think he has a right to expect loyal. And my \u2013 what I \u2013 my line \u2013 my line when I was at the NSC was, be loyal or be gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including when it means having a different view of the last election? Or having family members who work in the Justice Department? I mean there are some different definitions of loyalty.",
      "ROBERT GATES: Absolutely. If you hold views that are unacceptable to the president on things like that, like the election and so on, then you probably don't believe in his NSC staff. Maybe you belong at the State Department or at CIA or someplace, but you don't belong inside the White House complex.",
      "I think you need to give the president your honest views on things, on the subjects that you're in charge of. And it may be unwelcome to him. But he needs to hear different perspectives and different points of view. So, being loyal doesn't mean not \u2013 it doesn't mean pulling your punches in terms of the policy debate.

      "BRIDGET BRINK: Well, maybe let me give you a little context. What I saw in Ukraine was horrifying. For three years, Russia launched missiles and drones at men, women and children sleeping in their homes, tried to take down the energy grid for millions of Ukrainians to take out the power, heat and light in the middle of winter, and committed war crimes and atrocities at a level we haven't seen since World War II.",
      "I resigned from Ukraine and also from the foreign service because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all. It's appeasement. And as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear, you are a career diplomat. So, that means you serve regardless of who is the president of the United States and what party they come from. And, in fact, when you tried to leave post in January, Secretary Rubio asked you to stay on in Kyiv, as I understand it. You were there for a number of months until April.",

      "BRIDGET BRINK: Yes, of course, we do. I mean we're the \u2013 the leader and \u2013 of the free world.",
      "I think, let's just be clear, Russia and Putin have invaded a sovereign, independent, democratic country in the heart of Europe with the help of North Korea, Iran and China. This is fundamentally against U.S. interests. Europe is our largest trading partner, is responsible for 16 million jobs on both continents. And having this war, or any festering, unresolved war, on the margins of Europe, is very bad for the United States.",
      "So, what do we need to do as the United States? We need to put, together with partners and allies, pressure on Russia to end the war.",
      "And there are many ways to do this. We can put additional sanctions in the energy sector, in the banking sector. Russia's not as strong as some people say or some people think. The economy is hurting. They have 20 percent interest rates, 21 percent interest rates, 10 percent inflation. And so, right now is the time to increase the pressure on Russia, to bring Putin to the table, not decrease it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we know that President Trump and President Putin have plans to speak on Monday. When you were still in Kyiv, President Zelenskyy called out the U.S. embassy for what he called a disappointingly weak reaction from America following a missile attack that killed small children. He said, \"you must not be afraid to call things by their names, and the U.S. is afraid to even say the word Russian when speaking about the missile that murdered children.\"",
      "Do you feel American officials are being censored from saying things frankly and honestly?",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: I mean, our job as diplomats is to reflect and represent the policy of the \u2013 the president and the administration. That's our job. That's \u2013 that's what we do as professionals. And having worked for five different presidents, that requires reflecting that policy that's made constitutionally by the president.",
      "So, to me, the real question is, how are we going to help to end this war in a way that's in the interest of the United States? And to do that, it can't be peace at any price. It has to be a peace that does things that advance our own interest. And those are really simple. It's how to keep Ukraine free, how to deter Russia and how to send the right signal to China.",
      "And this is what we should be doing. And every step that we make in diplomacy I think should try to help achieve this goal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And call things what they are.",
      "BRIDGET BRINK: It's important for us, as the leader of the free world, again to be clear and accurate. And also, I think, it's an important moment in history. We've seen the devastation that happens when we appease aggressors. And we do not want to do that again. So, my strong advice in terms of how to deal with Putin and Russia is not to give a single meeting or concession or legitimacy until Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire that's verifiable and moves forward toward a just and lasting peace. On that basis, I can see a conversation and \u2013 and diplomacy that can achieve our interests.",

We certainly see there's a loss of trust in many of our country's institutions, whether it's the federal government, journalism, the courts.",
      "How do you describe our national character right now and the leaders we have?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes, I think it's confused. If you look at polling, as you've just referred to the lack of trust, like, 22 percent of Americans a year ago had trust in the U.S. government. Only 34 percent had trust in other Americans. So, I think we all sort of intuitively know we have a real problem.",
      "But what I would argue is, our national leaders are not the cause of the problem. They're the symptom of the problem. The cause is us at our individual level. Our unwillingness to think about character, to talk about character and to demand character.",
      "And I would also argue that we're also the cure. There is a symptom that we see, and we're distracted by it, all the things that we are disappointed by, people lying, people doing things that we find beneath us. As a nation, our character is our fate. And so what I'm trying to do is convince people to start a national conversation on character with the idea it starts at the bottom. Not at the top. We need to start it down where things actually happen, on farms, in schools. We've just sent out 240 copies of the book to college sports coaches, to try to have them start just to talk about character. And so, that's what I'm passionate about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I admire the effort. You know, it's interesting to look at where this began. Not pinning it on a person.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you're trying to do that. But is it a symptom of, it's always been this way, we just have more transparency and thus we know more about people's flaws? Why does this seem to be building as a problem?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Well, we've always had a problem with certain evil in society and corruption, lack of character. But I think the fact that we see everything so much now we normalize it. We start to accept things in celebrities or leaders that are frankly things we wouldn't have accepted even a generation ago. And that's sort of our problem. We give them our likes on social media. We spend our money with them. We vote for them. And we know better than that. And so I think the responsibility again arcs back to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not a Democrat or a Republican you say.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Though you did endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the last elections.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Most retired military try to stay out of politics and \u2013 and make an argument that that's crossing the Rubicon in some ways.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Well, of course, you go back to Dwight Eisenhower and Ulysses S. Grant. They actually went into politics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fair.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: So, there is some tradition. But that was not my goal to get into politics. I just felt that we had hit a period in which we were so adrift as a nation in terms of character. We were accepting something that is not as good as we are capable of. So, I made a decision. And I'll be honest, it was tough, because there's a lot of pushback from peers and from outsiders that say, you shouldn't get political. But I don't think that saying that America should stand up for its values and for its character is necessarily political.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we had, in the past, conversations with other guests that question about, what does America stand for and does it matter? There is a shift more towards pragmatism or what's in it for me on the national scale. That's very much in our politics right now.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: And I think it's a mistake for the nation. If you think what really helped the United States in the modern area, we'll call it after World War II, people admired American ideas. They admired American democracy. They admired our social, our culture. They didn't like every part of it. And they knew that we, as a nation, make mistakes. But countries and people wanted to be more like us than they wanted to be like the Soviet Union or other enemies. And as long as we are an example that people want to be, it gives us extraordinary influence and power. When it becomes transactional, when we \u2013 when we become somebody that just wants something from them and we're unwilling to be generous, we're unwilling to sacrifice for larger ideals, we lose some of our moral standing and I think some of our national force, our power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the Pentagon right now we hear a lot about values and culture sort of being at odds with the mission, or that's how it's being described, right? Secretary Hegseth has talked a lot about restoring the warrior ethos. That's part of his justification for eliminating diversity programs or DEI. Do you think DEI really, quote/unquote, hurts lethality?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes. I am completely aligned with Secretary Hegseth on the idea that we need to defend the nation, that the Defense Department needs to be as effective as it can be, and that a certain warrior ethos matters. We just define it differently. In my experience, we tend to understand that everybody can contribute. Particularly in today's modern wars. The idea that everybody has got to look a certain way, got to have biceps of a certain size, there's got to be a male, straight, all these things is not my experience. In the counterterrorist fight, where much of my experience was, it became a meritocracy. You didn't care what somebody looked like or how old they were, what their gender was, their sexual orientation, because it was too important to get the job done. And I would argue now, America needs to harness talent from every corner of our society. Everyone. I would even argue that if \u2013 if we went back to a draft, we could draft people with physical disabilities because much of what we do, that's not a block to that. And so, I think we need to think about, what do we need to feel the most effective armed forces. And I think that the DEI thing is frankly a distraction. It's not helpful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of national character, when you were commanding forces, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, you know very well that country. The Taliban has since taken over.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have seen them strip women and girls of even the right to have their voice heard in public. You have seen them carry out retribution against Afghans who worked with our country and put their lives at risk. This past week, the Trump administration said Afghanistan is safe enough for people living here to go back. They stripped the legal protections, the temporary protected status. They are ending some of the programs that helped to evacuate our American allies there. What do you think that says about our character now?",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: I think it's disappointing. I personally disagree with that decision. But I also think it sends a message. What about people who we ask to ally with us in the future? That we ask to partner with us. They look at what happened in the past. And so, I think our national character should be bigger than that. And we're capable of being bigger than that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General McChrystal, thank you very much for sharing your reflections.",
      "GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL: You're kind to have me. Thank you.",

      "The National Intelligence Council determined in a report that the Venezuelan government does not direct Tren de Aragua, contradicting the Trump administration's claims used to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, which gives it the power to swiftly remove migrants it identifies as members of the gang. The memo was released under the Freedom of Information Act following a request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "\"While Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,\" the report says.",
      "The question of whether the Maduro government controls Tren de Aragua is at the center of a clash over the Trump administration's ability to continue to deport suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. In a March proclamation, President Trump invoked the act, which had only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, treating suspected gang members like wartime enemies of the U.S. government. Mr. Trump had previously designated Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, along with MS-13 and other gangs and cartels.",
      "Shortly after the March proclamation was signed, the administration used the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 200 men, mostly Venezuelans, to a prison in El Salvador. An analysis by \"60 Minutes\" found that 75% of the Venezuelans deported had no criminal history.",
      "The move has sparked significant clashes with the federal courts, as the administration has pursued the swift apprehension and removal of Venezuelan nationals deemed alien enemies. On Friday, the Supreme Court said it would continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas while they pursue a challenge to their removals under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, maintaining an April directive.",
      "Last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired the two top officials who were leading the National Intelligence Council, Mike Collins, acting chair of National Intelligence Council, and his deputy, Maria Lagan-Riekhof, CBS News confirmed. NBC News reported those were the officials who oversaw the Tren de Aragua memo.",
      "Rubio refuted the National Intelligence Council report, while pointing to an FBI assessment that he said he agrees with. He outlined that not only is Tren de Aragua \"exported by the Venezuelan regime,\" but that there are warnings that it's also a terror organization that's \"already been operationalized\" to target an opposition member of another country.",
      "\"The FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago,\" Rubio said.",
      "Asked whether he completely rejects the intelligence community's findings, Rubio said he agrees \"100%\" with the FBI's findings. The FBI is overseen by the Trump administration's Justice Department.",
      "Rubio said \"this is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country,\" claiming that in some cases, \"they've been in cooperation.\" He added that suspected Tren de Aragua members who have been returned to Venezuela have been \"greeted like heroes\" at the airport.",
      "\"There's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile,\" Rubio said.",

      "An \"expression of aloha\"",
      "Hawaiians have been proudly sewing leis for more than 1,000 years. It's a tradition that was introduced by early Polynesian settlers who wore garlands around their necks or heads as a gesture of respect for the gods.",
      "There's never a wrong time to bestow someone with a lei, Estes says. Today, Hawaiians hand out leis for nearly every occasion \u2013 from weddings to funerals, to airport pickups and beyond.",

      "Getting creative",
      "But while lei making remains popular, its future could be in peril. Suburban sprawl has paved over many flower farms and climate change has overheated remaining land. An estimated 90 percent of flowers used in leis are now imported from countries like Thailand.",

      "\"Everybody's personal lei making stash or, you know, garden or mango tree or whatever you have, it's been reduced,\" he said.",
      "The fact that a lei only lasts around two or three days has also added more stress on the island's dwindling flower stock, forcing lei-makers like himself to adapt.",
      "\"We work with what we can get. Sometimes we don't get enough flowers to make a lei. We use unripe fruit. An ornamental banana. We recently had someone bring in avocados from their tree,\" said Mau, though he admits it breaks from tradition.",

    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",

      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",

      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war. Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, but Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.",
      "\"He didn't go, and I understand that,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of Putin's decision to skip the talks in Istanbul. \"We're going to get it done. We got to get it done. Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we're going to get it done.\"",

      "Between 2010 and 2018, half of the participants took GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) \u2014 injectable medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes \u2014 with at least\u00a0six drug purchases within 12 months. The other half underwent bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS).",

      "The findings were published in the journal eClinicalMedicine.",
      "\"The results point at the existence of additional pathways beyond weight loss in which GLP-1RAs contribute to the decreased risk of obesity-related cancer,\" lead study author Yael Wolff Sagy, PhD, head of research at Clalit Health Services, told Fox News Digital.",
      "How do GLP-1 RAs affect cancer risk?",
      "Niketa Patel, professor of molecular medicine with the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, Florida, noted that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation.",
      "\"GLP1-RAs are shown to reduce inflammation and thus decrease the risk of developing ORC,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Patel was not involved in the study.)",
      "\"The anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers.\"",
      "\"Bottom line: Obesity can cause certain cancers, and treatment of obesity with GLP1-RA reduces the risk of only obesity-related cancers.\"",
      "Dr. Britta Reierson, MD, medical director of knownwell, a provider of metabolic health services, said there are several ways in which GLP-1 RAs could have cancer mitigation properties.",
      "\"First, the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers,\" the Minnesota-based doctor, who also was not part of the research, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Overall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Second, the metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\"",
      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",
      "\"Although the direction of the results is promising, we should wait and see if and how clinical guidelines will consider it.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Reierson agreed that much more research is needed before GLP-1 RAs could ever be considered as cancer prevention options.",
      "\"Larger, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to confirm the observed effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms,\" she said.",

      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"",

But that wasn't the position of Justice Department. But certainly he didn't have the right to have those records from his days of the Senate,\" Fitton said.",

      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",

      "While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.",
      "This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics.",
      "By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

      "What was learned and tested",
      "The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK.",
      "Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

These services allow you to securely store your photos, videos and documents in the cloud, freeing up valuable storage on your device. One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",
      "Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",

The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",
      "1. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "3. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts that offer this feature, especially for cloud storage services.",
      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage. Windows supports a range of cloud storage options, including its own services like OneDrive.",

Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",

      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy.

      "Jeff Bezos is backing a bold new venture that's positioning itself to disrupt the electric vehicle space: Slate Auto. It's a startup that has unveiled a simple, modular electric pickup truck called the Slate Truck. It's priced at $20,000 after federal EV incentives, a concept some would consider radical and even inconceivable.",
      "The Slate Truck's base model defies industry norms by stripping down to essentials, with no power windows, no touchscreen and a minimalist dashboard.",
      "However, at the same time, it offers a range of customization options, allowing buyers to transform it into a five-seat SUV.",

      "Slate Truck by the numbers",
      "The Slate Truck is a compact electric pickup, measuring 174.6 inches in length, 70.6 inches wide excluding mirrors and 69.3 inches tall, making it more than 20 inches shorter than a Ford Maverick and reminiscent of classic pickups like the 1985 Toyota truck. It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space. The truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, delivering rear-wheel drive only and accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, with a top speed near 90 mph.",

Charging is flexible, with an 11 kW onboard AC charger and DC fast charging up to 120 kW through a NACS connector, allowing a 20% to 80% charge in about half an hour. The Slate Truck has a maximum payload capacity of 1,433 pounds and can tow up to 1,000 pounds, making it practical for everyday hauling needs.",
      "Safety features include traction control, electronic stability control, automated emergency braking, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and up to eight airbags, with the company targeting a five-star NCAP safety rating. The curb weight is about 3,600 pounds.",

The vehicle\u2019s exterior can be wrapped in different colors and designs instead of painted, allowing owners to easily change its look or even do it themselves with a DIY kit.

      "Kurt Knutsson has advice to protect information from cybercriminals who are seeking new ways to gain login credentials and full control of computers and bank accounts.",
      "Online scams are becoming more dangerous and convincing every day. Cybercriminals are finding new ways to gain not just your login credentials but full control of your computer and your bank accounts.",
      "Take John from King George, Virginia, for example. He recently shared his alarming experience with us. His story is a powerful warning about how quickly things can escalate if you respond to suspicious emails.",
      "Here is what happened to John in his own words: \"I mistakenly responded to a false PayPal email notifying me of a laptop purchase. The message looked real, and I called the number listed. The person on the phone gave me a strange number to enter into my browser, which installed an app that took control of my PC. A warning popped up saying 'software updating \u2013 do not turn off PC,' and I could see my entire file system being scanned. The scammer accessed my bank account and transferred money between accounts. He told me to leave my PC running and go to the bank, keeping him on the phone without telling anyone what was happening.

      "Fake PayPal scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Key takeaways from John's experience",
      "John\u2019s close call highlights several important lessons.",
      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts. Acting within minutes rather than hours can stop further theft, block fraudulent transactions and protect your sensitive information from being fully compromised.",

      "How to protect yourself from remote access scams",
      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TECH SUPPORT SCAMS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "John\u2019s story is a reminder that online scams are evolving quickly and becoming more aggressive. Staying skeptical, verifying all suspicious messages and acting quickly if something feels wrong can make the difference between staying safe and losing sensitive information. Protect your devices, trust your instincts and remember it is always better to be cautious than to take a risk with your security.",

For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",

      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",

      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate.

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi.

These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",

      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",
      "The road ahead",
      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

The perjury charge stems from a lie she allegedly told South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Toal in January 2024, when the justice ruled that a new trial was not necessary for Murdaugh upon his appeal.",
      "Charging documents state that when Toal asked Hill, \"Did you allow anyone from the press to view sealed exhibits?\" Hill responded, \"No, ma'am,\" which is apparently inconsistent with evidence obtained by authorities. They also accuse her of showing sealed photos to a reporter and using her official position as Colleton County clerk for financial gain, specifically by promoting her book about the Murdaugh case on social media.",

      "A Colleton County jury in 2023 convicted Murduagh in the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, on his family hunting estate. The disgraced personal injury lawyer, whose family had a stronghold on the justice system in neighboring Hampton County for about a century, had requested the new hearing based on allegations of jury tampering surrounding Hill, which Murdaugh's defense team had argued warranted a new trial.",

      "\"That had been\u2026 the focus at the hearing for the retrial. Nothing in [Hill's charges] about jury tampering,\" he said. \"To my mind, it's a really big win for the state and a big loss for the defense because a main ground of their appeal would be this jury tampering, and the fact that there are no charges against former clerk Hill for jury tampering tells me that the authorities looked at that and did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show that she tampered with the jury.\"",
      "SOUTH CAROLINA JUDGE DENIES ALEX MURDAUGH'S REQUEST FOR A NEW MURDER TRIAL",
      "Meanwhile, attorney Eric Bland of Bland Richter LLP, who represented multiple jurors in Murdaugh's murder trial and several victims of his financial crimes, told Fox News Digital that \"the optics\" of Hill's charges \"bode well for Alex Murdaugh.\"",
      "\"Three of those charges that are pending in Colleton County really have nothing to do with the trial. [Those are] actions that she took outside of that trial in the course and scope of her duties, taking advantage of her office \u2014 obstruction activity. That has nothing to do with it,\" Bland explained. \"One charge in Richland County is a perjury charge. And it's perjury that does stem from the [January 2024] hearing where Justice Toal rendered a decision not giving a new trial to Alex Murdaugh.\"",
      "Bland noted that Toal said during the 2024 hearing that she did not find Hill's testimony entirely credible and did not take it into consideration when ruling against a retrial.",

      "\"At the end of the day, this is going to be a legal decision on appeal,\" Bland said. \"Was Justice Toal correct in applying the South Carolina standard on juror interference by an official? And that, as the South Carolina standard says, you not only have to show the juror interference, but you have to show the effect that it had on the jurors and their verdict. I represented six of those jurors. Eleven of those jurors said\u2026 anything that Becky Hill said didn't have any effect on our verdict.\"",
      "Of 12 total jurors who found Murdaugh guilty in 2023, 11 said Hill did not influence their decisions. One said he heard the clerk make comments about watching Murdaugh's body language but said her words did not influence his verdict.",

She's in charge of the clerk of court's office, where all the filings for the case go, and marshaling all the evidence. She's in charge of the jurors and making sure that they get there on time and they're comfortable and they have something to eat.

And again, I don't think there was a malicious intent with that whatsoever. Having said that... one would expect a clerk of court under these heightened circumstances to follow each and every rule, and the allegations show that she did not. But I don't think it was done with any evil intention.\"",

      "Jose Mujica, a one-time guerrilla and later president of Uruguay who drove a beat-up VW Beetle and enacted progressive reforms that carried his reputation well beyond South America, has died aged 89.",
      "The straight-talking Mujica, known to many Uruguayans by his nickname \"Pepe,\" led the small farming country's leftist government from 2010 to 2015 after convincing voters his radical past was a closed chapter.",
      "FORMER URUGUAYAN PRESIDENT JOSE MUJICA ANNOUNCES ESOPHAGEAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS",
      "\"It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of our comrade Pepe Mujica,\" President Yamandu Orsi said in a post on X. \"Thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.\"",
      "As president, Mujica adopted what was then a pioneering liberal stance on issues related to civil liberties. He signed a law allowing gay marriage and abortions in early pregnancy, and backed a proposal to legalize marijuana sales. The gay marriage and abortion measures were a big shift for Catholic Latin America, and the move on marijuana was at the time almost unprecedented worldwide.",
      "Regional leaders, including leftist presidents in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, mourned Mujica's passing and praised his example.",
      "\"He defended democracy like few others. And he never stopped advocating for social justice and the end of all inequalities,\" said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Mujica's \"greatness transcended the borders of Uruguay and his presidential term,\" he added.",
      "During his term in office, Mujica refused to move to the presidential residence, choosing to stay in his modest home where he kept a small flower farm in a suburb of Montevideo, the capital.",
      "Shunning a formal suit and tie, it was common to see him driving around in his Beetle or eating at downtown restaurants where office workers had lunch.",

      "In a May 2024 interview with Reuters in the tin-roofed house that Mujica shared with his wife, former Senator Lucia Topolansky, he said he had kept the old Beetle and that it was still in \"phenomenal\" condition.",
      "But, he added, he preferred a turn on the tractor, saying it was \"more entertaining\" than a car and was a place where \"you have time to think.\"",
      "Critics questioned Mujica's tendency to break with protocol, while his blunt and occasionally uncouth statements sometimes forced him to explain himself, under pressure from opponents and political allies alike.",
      "But it was his down-to-earth style and progressive musings that endeared him to many Uruguayans.",
      "\"The problem is that the world is run by old people, who forget what they were like when they were young,\" Mujica said during the 2024 interview.",
      "Mujica himself was 74 when he became president. He was elected with 52% of the vote, despite some voters' concerns about his age and his past as one of the leaders of the Tupamaros rebel group in the 1960s and 1970s.",
      "Lucia Topolansky was Mujica's long-term partner, dating back to their days in the Tupamaros. The couple married in 2005, and she served as vice president from 2017-2020.",
      "After leaving office, they remained politically active, regularly attending inaugurations of Latin American presidents and giving crucial backing to candidates in Uruguay, including Orsi, who took office in March 2025. They stopped growing flowers on their small holding but continued to cultivate vegetables, including tomatoes that Topolansky pickled each season.",
      "BEHIND BARS",
      "Jose Mujica's birth certificate recorded him as born in 1935, although he claimed there was an error and that he was actually born a year earlier. He once described his upbringing as \"dignified poverty.\"",
      "Mujica's father died when he was 9 or 10 years old, and as a boy he helped his mother maintain the farm where they grew flowers and kept chickens and a few cows.",
      "At the time Mujica became interested in politics, Uruguay's left was weak and fractured and he began his political career in a progressive wing of the center-right National Party.",
      "In the late 1960s, he joined the Marxist Tupamaros guerrilla movement, which sought to weaken Uruguay's conservative government through robberies, political kidnappings and bombings.",
      "Mujica later said that he had never killed anyone but was involved in several violent clashes with police and soldiers and was once shot six times.",
      "Uruguay's security forces gained the upper hand over the Tupamaros by the time the military swept to power in a 1973 coup, marking the start of a 12-year dictatorship in which about 200 people were kidnapped and killed. Thousands more were jailed and tortured.",
      "Mujica spent almost 15 years behind bars, many in solitary confinement, lying at the bottom of an old horse trough with only ants for company. He managed to escape twice, once by tunneling into a nearby house. His biggest \"vice\" as he approached 90, he later said, was talking to himself, alluding to his time in isolation.",
      "When democracy was restored to the farming country of roughly 3 million people in 1985, Mujica was released and returned to politics, gradually becoming a prominent figure on the left.",
      "He served as agriculture minister in the center-left coalition of his predecessor, President Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, who would go on to succeed him from 2015 to 2020.",
      "Mujica's support base was on the left, but he maintained a fluid dialogue with opponents within the center-right, inviting them to traditional barbecues at his home.",
      "\"We can't pretend to agree on everything. We have to agree with what there is, not with what we like,\" he said.",
      "He believed drugs should be decriminalized \"under strict state control\" and addiction addressed.",
      "\"I do not defend drug use. But I can't defend (a ban) because now we have two problems: drug addiction, which is a disease, and narcotrafficking, which is worse,\" he said.",

      "In retirement, he remained resolutely optimistic.",
      "\"I want to convey to all the young people that life is beautiful, but it wears out and you fall,\" he said following a cancer diagnosis.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 14:17:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance returned to Rome for the inaugural Mass of Pope Leo XIV, continuing a spiritual journey that has weathered criticism from leaders of the Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 After leaving the Marines and beginning his higher education, Vice President JD Vance drifted into atheism \u2014 struggling, he would eventually write, with feelings of \u201cirrelevance\u201d in his faith and with \u201ca desire for social acceptance among American elites.\u201d",
      "Vance, who later converted to Catholicism, this weekend made his second trip to the Vatican in less than a month. On the first visit, Vance met with Pope Francis on Easter, hours before he died. On Sunday, Vance led a U.S. delegation at the inaugural Mass of the first U.S.-born pope, Leo XIV.",
      "Both pontiffs \u2014 Francis during his papacy, Leo in his prior service as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost \u2014 offered veiled but easily decipherable rebukes of President Donald Trump and Vance\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview. Vance, somewhat uncharacteristically for someone who so relishes debate, has chosen to politely sidestep criticism. But the circumstances of the last few weeks have put an unexpected spotlight on his religion, reinforcing his status as one of the world\u2019s highest-ranking Catholics in political office.",
      "At Sunday\u2019s Mass, the vice president scored a prime seat in the first row to the right of the dais, near delegations from Italy and Peru, where the pope is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop and archbishop.",
      "In his homily, delivered in Italian, Leo spoke of \u201ctoo many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth\u2019s resources and marginalizes the poorest,\u201d according to an English translation provided by the Vatican.",
      "Vance and second lady Usha Vance briefly greeted the pope before leaving the Vatican on Sunday.",
      "\u201cOf course, the American pope \u2014 the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him,\u201d Vance said during the opening of a trilateral meeting Sunday afternoon in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "The White House was eager to frame this weekend's visit in historic terms.",
      "\u201cPope Leo XIV is the first American Pope. Vice President Vance is the first Catholic convert to serve as Vice President,\u201d Vance\u2019s office emphasized when announcing the trip.",
      "Vance is the second Catholic to serve as vice president, after Joe Biden, who went on to become the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden grew up in the Catholic Church, while Vance came to it as an adult. Joining Vance in Rome and at the Vatican this weekend was Father Henry Stephan, the priest who baptized him in 2019.",
      "After landing in Rome at sunset on Saturday night, Vance\u2019s motorcade first sped to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where he and the second lady paid their respects at Francis\u2019 tomb.",
      "In February, Francis sent a letter to U.S. bishops that was viewed by many as a scolding of Trump\u2019s immigration policy in general and of Vance\u2019s justification of it in particular. Vance responded by trying to defuse any tensions. Speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast that same month, Vance said that while Francis\u2019 criticism surprised him, the pope was \u201cfundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership.\u201d",
      "The remark came after Vance, who is known for his combative online presence, lamented to his audience that the rise of social media was unhealthy for religious discourse. (Vance excused Trump\u2019s recent post featuring an AI image depicting the president as the pope as a joke.)",
      "\u201cWe are not called as Christians to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should frankly take a page out of the books of our grandparents, who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance, but didn\u2019t obsess or fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Vance struck a similar tone this month after Leo\u2019s election as pope drew attention to stories he had shared on social media as a cardinal that were critical of Trump and Vance. While wrestling with Leo\u2019s politics in an interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Vance offered a nuanced answer and said he prefers \u201cnot to play the politicization of the pope game.\u201d",
      "Yet for all of Vance\u2019s social media bluster, he telegraphed years before his vice presidency that the papacy is an authority that he is reluctant to cross.",
      "In a 2020 essay he wrote about his conversion in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance recalled confronting \u201ca conservative Catholic writer about his criticism of the pope.\u201d Vance asserted that \u201ctoo many American Catholics have failed to show proper deference to the papacy, treating the pope as a political figure to be criticized or praised according to their whims.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s conversion is a less plumbed part of his past. Aside from The Lamp essay and thoughts he shared with a conservative writer friend who attended his baptism, away from public audiences, Vance has talked rather sparingly about his spiritual journey.",
      "At the Catholic prayer breakfast in February, Vance noted his interfaith marriage to Usha, who is Hindu, and how they are raising their three children Catholic while allowing them to decide when to be baptized. He said his most exciting moment last November \u2014 the month he was elected vice president \u2014 was when his 7-year-old son chose to be baptized.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there is a lot I don\u2019t know,\u201d Vance said that day. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith baby Christians. And I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic, that there are things about the faith that I don\u2019t know. And so I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith publicly, because of course I\u2019m not always going to get it right.\u201d"

    "summary": "Taiwan's youth are stuck. There's growing concern in Taipei over the reliability of the Trump-led U.S. as a security partner, even despite Chinese aggression.",
    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Morning-after pills are now stocked at thousands of highway gas stations, corner delis and 24-hour convenience stores in 48 states.",
    "story": [
      "Convenience stores are aptly named. They\u2019re stocked with essentials people need at all hours of the day or night, everything from a quart of milk to a package of condoms. But they haven\u2019t stocked contraception for women.",
      "That\u2019s slowly and steadily changing as an Oakland, California-based company, Cadence, has spent the last year stocking highway gas stations, corner delis and 24-hour convenience stores with its own emergency contraception brand called \u201cMorning After Pill,\u201d which prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or a birth control mishap.",
      "The first morning-after pills, a single dose of levonorgestrel, hit convenience store shelves in Texas in March 2024. Since then, according to company executives, the pills are in some 11,000 locations in 48 states.\u00a0South Dakota and Hawaii are the last holdouts. A zip code search found the product everywhere from an E-Z Mart in San Antonio to a deli in Walla Walla, Washington.",
      "Kate Voyten, the company\u2019s senior vice president of commercial operations, said that Cadence, which is also seeking Food and Drug Administration approval for its over-the-counter regular birth control pill, is trying to make it easier for women to control their sexual health.",
      "\u201cOur original goal was to transform contraception,\u201d she said. \u201cGet it everywhere there is a condom.\u201d",
      "About one-third of all prophylactics for men are sold at convenience stores, she noted, and yet the stores \u201chave nothing for females\u201d except tampons and pregnancy tests.",
      "Over-the-counter emergency contraception is a safe and effective synthetic hormone that\u2019s meant to be used when a condom breaks, a regular birth control pill is missed, or no birth control is used. It works by inhibiting or delaying ovulation and doesn\u2019t end an existing pregnancy or harm a fertilized egg that is already implanted in the uterus, according to the FDA. And it doesn\u2019t affect future fertility. Some patients may experience a later or earlier menstrual period and short-term spotting, headache, nausea, and fatigue.",
      "Availability in stores such as 7-Eleven and Circle K comes even as legislators in some Republican-led states have indicated they want a new level of scrutiny for contraception. It\u2019s been nearly three years since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion and that decision \u2014 handed down by the court\u2019s conservative majority \u2014 led to many Republican states, including Texas and Tennessee, to criminalize abortion.",
      "The fallout from state abortion bans cut off some women\u2019s access to contraception, since many abortion providers that were forced to close also provided birth control.",
      "In particular, hormonal birth control, which includes emergency contraception, has been under increasing attack from the religious right.",
      "A major legal victory by a conservative Christian legal group in Texas restricted minors\u2019 access to birth control in that state, and a Trump administration order freezing $65 million in family planning funds has threatened contraceptive access from Mississippi to California.",
      "While the Catholic Church has long opposed all forms of artificial birth control, leading anti-abortion groups such as Students for Life of America have ramped up their campaigns targeting emergency contraception, intrauterine devices, shots, implants, patches and birth control pills. The groups falsely claim that these methods are \u201cabortifacients\u201d that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman\u2019s uterus.",
      "In some states, such as South Carolina, Alabama, Texas, abortion is illegal as soon as an egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube, even before the zygote travels to the uterus and implants."

      "Reflecting on her relationship with her late father, Mariska Hargitay told the outlet, \u201cHe was my everything, my idol. He loved me so much, and I knew it. I also knew something else \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know what I knew.\u201d",
      "Mariska Hargitay described feeling different from the rest of her siblings \u2014 including two brothers and three half-siblings \u2014 and understood why during her 20s. During that period, somebody showed her a picture of Sardelli, and she recalled instinctually knowing that he was her biological father.",
      "However, when she brought it up to Mickey Hargitay, he denied the claim, and she said she never brought up Sardelli to her father again. Mariska Hargitay didn\u2019t drop her suspicion though, and when she was 30, she saw Sardelli perform in Atlantic City and introduced herself to him, causing him to cry.",
      "\u201cI went full Olivia Benson on him,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want anything, I don\u2019t need anything from you .\u2026 I have a dad. There was something about loyalty. I wanted to be loyal to Mickey.\u201d",
      "Over time, Mariska Hargitay was able to form a bond with Sardelli and his daughters, but she understood why her mom reconciled with Mickey Hargitay.",
      "\u201cI grew up where I was supposed to, and I do know that everyone made the best choice for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Mickey Hargitay\u2019s daughter \u2014 that is not a lie.\u201d",
      "She called the documentary \u201ca kind of love letter\u201d to her father \u201cbecause there\u2019s no one that I was closer to on this planet.\u201d",
      "The documentary includes cameos from both families, including Sardelli, and her siblings Jayne Marie, Zoltan and Mickey Jr, per Vanity Fair. She also hosted a private screening with her sisters on the Sardelli side, sharing that they \u201cwept and wept and wept\u201d at the film.",
      "\u201cThese two women that I love so much \u2014 I made them secrets! It\u2019s so heartbreaking to me,\u201d she said, recalling a time she introduced them as \u201cfamily friends\u201d in conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not good with lies. So I also made this movie to unburden all of us.\u201d",
      "Mariska Hargitay previously opened up about\u00a0the lessons she learned from Mickey Hargitay\u00a0during an appearance on Sunday Sitdown with TODAY\u2019s Willie Geist in January.",
      "\u201cHigh school sports and my father\u2019s training taught me how to get back on the horse and have the stamina to do \u2018SVU.\u2019 \u2018Cause there were hard years,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were times when I (thought), \u2018I don\u2019t know if I have it. I don\u2019t know if I can continue this.\u2019 But then, we would do an episode, and I fell so madly, deeply in love with my co-stars. And I was working with such great actors.\u201d"

      "The car bombing outside a California fertility clinic that killed one person and injured four others appears to have been driven by anti-natalist ideology, according to two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the incident.",
      "The suspect, identified by authorities as Guy Edward Bartkus, is believed to have detonated the explosive in Saturday\u2019s attack, which claimed his own life.",
      "Investigators are focusing on social media posts made by the suspect, including a 30-minute audio recording, which they say support anti-natalist views. While the posts and the recording are still being verified, officials believe they reflect the ideology behind the bombing. Anti-natalism refers to the belief that no one should have children.",
      "The same person may also be linked to an online forum post from earlier this month in which the individual contemplated suicide using an explosive device, the sources said. They are also investigating a YouTube account, under the same moniker, that features videos of experiments with homemade explosives.",
      "At a press conference on Sunday, authorities said they believe the suspect was attempting to livestream the attack and are looking into what they call a \u201cmanifesto.\u201d",
      "The suspect was reportedly dealing with depression and had personal relationship issues, law enforcement officials close to the investigation said. Authorities said he was 25 years old and from Twentynine Palms, where they are executing a search warrant.",
      "On Saturday, multiple law enforcement tactical officers were seen outside a Twentynine Palms residence, about an hour away from the targeted fertility clinic.",
      "The FBI and Palm Springs Police Department had originally held off on identifying the suspect, citing the condition of his body after the blast.",
      "The severity of the injuries sustained by those hurt in the blast has not been disclosed, but all have been released from the hospital, officials said Sunday.",
      "The blast, which the FBI deemed an act of terrorism, took place at 1199 North Indian Canyon Dr. at around 11 a.m.,\u00a0according city officials. The street is home to a number of medical facilities, including the Desert Regional Medical Center.",
      "The apparent target of the attack, a fertility clinic called American Reproductive Centers (ARC), confirmed in a Facebook post that a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near its Palm Springs facility.",
      "The explosion caused damage to multiple buildings and businesses within a 250-yard blast radius, officials said. Witnesses said the blast was heard and felt miles away.",
      "The investigation is intensifying rapidly on multiple fronts, law enforcement officials told NBC News.",
      "On Sunday, officials continue forensic examinations of physical evidence at and around the blast zone, while canvassing the area for video footage to help establish a timeline of events leading up to the explosion.",
      "Authorities are seeking interviews with family, friends and associates while reviewing social media accounts and online posts that may be linked to the case. At Sunday\u2019s press conference, officials asked for the public\u2019s help in identifying Bartkus\u2019 movements and confirmed he was driving a 2010 silver Ford Fusion.",
      "The bombing investigation is likely one of the largest of its kind the FBI\u2019s Southern California field office has had to deal with, said Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles office.",
      "Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills believes the explosion was an isolated incident.",
      "\u201cI am absolutely confident\u00a0that this city is safe,\u201d Mills said Sunday. \u201cThere is no continuing threat.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on Sunday said \u201cit was a mistake\u201d for Democrats to allow Joe Biden to remain in the 2024 presidential race for as long as he did, echoing recent comments from other Democrats as the party reckons with fallout from new reporting on the then-president\u2019s mental acuity.",
      "\u201cBy 2024, the American people had decided that they wanted somebody new. They wanted somebody younger,\u201d Murphy told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it was a mistake,\u201d the senator said. \u201cIt was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier and set up a process that would have gotten us in a position where we could have been more competitive that fall.\u201d",
      "Murphy\u2019s comments come just days before the release of \u201cOriginal Sin,\u201d a book by Axios\u2019 Alex Thompson and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that includes interviews with people in Biden\u2019s orbit who say they saw his mental state decline while he was president.",
      "It also comes after Axios published the full interview between Biden and special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated whether Biden improperly stored classified documents following his time as vice president in the Obama administration.",
      "The interview, conducted in October 2023, led to Hur\u2019s assertion in a February 2024 report outlining his decision not to charge Biden that the former president was an \u201celderly man with a poor memory.\u201d The newly released audio of the interview confirmed Biden\u2019s memory lapses during Hur\u2019s questioning.",
      "Murphy on Sunday defended Biden, saying he had not read the \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d book but worked with the former president closely on legislation in 2023 and \u201cI saw a president who was in control.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my experience,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cBut I admit that by 2024 the American public had made up their mind, right, that they wanted the Democratic Party to nominate somebody new, and it was absolutely a mistake for the party to not listen to those voters.\u201d",
      "Still, Murphy conceded that \u201cwe all bear responsibility\u201d for how the election turned out, with President Donald Trump returning to the White House for a second term after beating then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\u201cI think, you know, we maybe didn\u2019t listen as early as we should have, in part, because we have immense loyalty to this man who had led this country out of a pandemic, who had been maybe the most prodigious legislator as a president,\u201d Murphy told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\u201cUltimately, in retrospect, you can\u2019t defend what the Democratic Party did,\u201d the senator added, saying the country was now \u201cstuck\u201d with Trump and \u201cwe should have given ourselves a better chance to win.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, in July 2024, Biden did step down from his re-election campaign, quickly endorsing Harris and clearing the way for her to accept the Democratic nomination weeks later at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "But Murphy said Sunday that an open primary would have benefited the party\u2019s prospects.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, the president should have gotten out of the race earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Democratic Party would have been better served by having the ability to have an open primary. Kamala Harris probably would have done very well in that process, but in retrospect, we lost.\u201d",
      "His remarks echoed those that Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., made to \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last week, where she told Welker, \u201cYes, we would have been served better by a primary. But we are where we are.\u201d",
      "On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made a similar point.",
      "\u201cLook, the Democratic Party needs to be honest,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense people want honesty. They want to restore a sense of public service in light of what has come out. It\u2019s painfully obvious President Biden should not have run.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance returned to Rome for the inaugural Mass of Pope Leo XIV, continuing a spiritual journey that has weathered criticism from leaders of the Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 After leaving the Marines and beginning his higher education, Vice President JD Vance drifted into atheism \u2014 struggling, he would eventually write, with feelings of \u201cirrelevance\u201d in his faith and with \u201ca desire for social acceptance among American elites.\u201d",
      "Vance, who later converted to Catholicism, this weekend made his second trip to the Vatican in less than a month. On the first visit, Vance met with Pope Francis on Easter, hours before he died. On Sunday, Vance led a U.S. delegation at the inaugural Mass of the first U.S.-born pope, Leo XIV.",
      "Both pontiffs \u2014 Francis during his papacy, Leo in his prior service as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost \u2014 offered veiled but easily decipherable rebukes of President Donald Trump and Vance\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview. Vance, somewhat uncharacteristically for someone who so relishes debate, has chosen to politely sidestep criticism. But the circumstances of the last few weeks have put an unexpected spotlight on his religion, reinforcing his status as one of the world\u2019s highest-ranking Catholics in political office.",
      "At Sunday\u2019s Mass, the vice president scored a prime seat in the first row to the right of the dais, near delegations from Italy and Peru, where the pope is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop and archbishop.",
      "In his homily, delivered in Italian, Leo spoke of \u201ctoo many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth\u2019s resources and marginalizes the poorest,\u201d according to an English translation provided by the Vatican.",
      "Vance and second lady Usha Vance briefly greeted the pope before leaving the Vatican on Sunday.",
      "\u201cOf course, the American pope \u2014 the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him,\u201d Vance said during the opening of a trilateral meeting Sunday afternoon in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "The White House was eager to frame this weekend's visit in historic terms.",
      "\u201cPope Leo XIV is the first American Pope. Vice President Vance is the first Catholic convert to serve as Vice President,\u201d Vance\u2019s office emphasized when announcing the trip.",
      "Vance is the second Catholic to serve as vice president, after Joe Biden, who went on to become the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden grew up in the Catholic Church, while Vance came to it as an adult. Joining Vance in Rome and at the Vatican this weekend was Father Henry Stephan, the priest who baptized him in 2019.",
      "After landing in Rome at sunset on Saturday night, Vance\u2019s motorcade first sped to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where he and the second lady paid their respects at Francis\u2019 tomb.",
      "In February, Francis sent a letter to U.S. bishops that was viewed by many as a scolding of Trump\u2019s immigration policy in general and of Vance\u2019s justification of it in particular. Vance responded by trying to defuse any tensions. Speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast that same month, Vance said that while Francis\u2019 criticism surprised him, the pope was \u201cfundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership.\u201d",
      "The remark came after Vance, who is known for his combative online presence, lamented to his audience that the rise of social media was unhealthy for religious discourse. (Vance excused Trump\u2019s recent post featuring an AI image depicting the president as the pope as a joke.)",
      "\u201cWe are not called as Christians to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should frankly take a page out of the books of our grandparents, who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance, but didn\u2019t obsess or fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Vance struck a similar tone this month after Leo\u2019s election as pope drew attention to stories he had shared on social media as a cardinal that were critical of Trump and Vance. While wrestling with Leo\u2019s politics in an interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Vance offered a nuanced answer and said he prefers \u201cnot to play the politicization of the pope game.\u201d",
      "Yet for all of Vance\u2019s social media bluster, he telegraphed years before his vice presidency that the papacy is an authority that he is reluctant to cross.",
      "In a 2020 essay he wrote about his conversion in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance recalled confronting \u201ca conservative Catholic writer about his criticism of the pope.\u201d Vance asserted that \u201ctoo many American Catholics have failed to show proper deference to the papacy, treating the pope as a political figure to be criticized or praised according to their whims.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s conversion is a less plumbed part of his past. Aside from The Lamp essay and thoughts he shared with a conservative writer friend who attended his baptism, away from public audiences, Vance has talked rather sparingly about his spiritual journey.",
      "At the Catholic prayer breakfast in February, Vance noted his interfaith marriage to Usha, who is Hindu, and how they are raising their three children Catholic while allowing them to decide when to be baptized. He said his most exciting moment last November \u2014 the month he was elected vice president \u2014 was when his 7-year-old son chose to be baptized.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there is a lot I don\u2019t know,\u201d Vance said that day. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith baby Christians. And I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic, that there are things about the faith that I don\u2019t know. And so I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith publicly, because of course I\u2019m not always going to get it right.\u201d"

      "\u201cI think that Moody\u2019s is a lagging indicator,\u201d Bessent said Sunday. \u201cI think that\u2019s what everyone thinks of credit agencies.\u201d",
      "Moody\u2019s Ratings said last week that the downgrade from Aaa to Aa1 \u201creflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary asserted that the downgrade was related to the Biden administration\u2019s spending policies, which that administration had touted as investments in priorities, including combating climate change and increasing health care coverage.",
      "\u201cJust like Sean Duffy said with our air traffic control system, we didn\u2019t get here in the past 100 days,\u201d Bessent continued, referring to the transportation secretary. \u201cIt\u2019s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has $36.22 trillion in national debt, according to the Treasury Department. It began growing steadily in the 1980s and continued increasing during both President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "Bessent also told moderator Kristen Welker that he spoke on the phone with the CEO of Walmart, Doug McMillon, who the treasury secretary said told him the retail giant would \u201ceat some of the tariffs, just as they did in \u201918, \u201919 and \u201920.\u201d",
      "Walmart CFO John David Rainey previously told CNBC that Walmart would absorb some higher costs related to tariffs. The CFO had also told CNBC separately that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d consumers would \u201cstart seeing higher prices,\u201d pointing to tariffs.",
      "Trump said in a post to Truth Social last week that Walmart should \u201ceat the tariffs.\u201d Walmart responded, saying the company has \u201calways worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won\u2019t stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "When asked about his conversation, Bessent denied he applied any pressure on Walmart to \u201ceat the tariffs,\u201d noting that he and the CEO \u201chave a very good relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just wanted to hear it from him, rather than second-, thirdhand from the press,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "McMillon had said on Walmart\u2019s earnings call that tariffs have put pressure on prices. Bessent argued that companies \u201chave to give the worst-case scenario\u201d on the calls.",
      "The White House has said that countries are approaching the administration to negotiate over tariffs. The administration has also announced trade agreements with the United Kingdom and China.",
      "Bessent said on Sunday that he thinks countries that do not negotiate in good faith would see duties return to the rates announced the day the administration unveiled across-the-board tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe negotiating leverage that President Trump is talking about here is if you don\u2019t want to negotiate, then it will spring back to the April 2 level,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was also asked about Trump saying the administration would accept a luxury jet from Qatar to be used as Air Force One, infuriating Democrats and drawing criticism from some Republicans as well.",
      "The treasury secretary called questions about the $400 million gift an \u201coff-ramp for many in the media not to acknowledge what an incredible trip this was,\u201d referring to investment commitments the president received during his trip last week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cIf we go back to your initial question on the Moody\u2019s downgrade, who cares? Qatar doesn\u2019t. Saudi doesn\u2019t. UAE doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all pushing money in.\u201d",

      "He added that the president\u2019s current plan is \u201cvery different\u201d from how Trump\u2019s first administration, in which Pence served as vice president, operated.",
      "\u201cWe very much used the threat of tariffs as leverage for negotiations, Kristen,\u201d Pence said, adding later: \u201cWhat I see in this administration is a steady drive toward a baseline of maybe even 10% tariffs that I think would be harmful to jobs in America. It would be harmful to consumers in America.\u201d",
      "Pence also criticized Trump\u2019s frequent line about who pays tariffs when they are imposed.",
      "\u201cAs the president has said to me many times, he has a sense that other countries pay tariffs,\u201d Pence said, \u201cwhen the reality is, when Americans buy goods overseas, the company that imports those goods in this country pays the tariff and more often than not passes that along in higher prices to consumers.\u201d",
      "Views of Vance and the role of the vice president",
      "Asked whether he objected to the tariffs on certain consumer goods that Trump imposed during his first term, Pence admitted that he probably had, but privately.",
      "\u201cI probably did in the hallways, but the president gets to make the decision,\u201d Pence said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re vice president of the United States, my view is always this: I\u2019d favor the president, with the full range of my opinion in private,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd then when he made the decision, my job was to support his decision absent some higher calling or higher obligation that one has.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the interview, Pence also spoke about the counsel he hopes Trump is receiving from those around him now, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was not just my president. He was my friend,\u201d Pence said, describing his relationship with Trump during his first term, which frayed after Pence resisted Trump\u2019s pressure to use his role to try to overturn the 2020 election results when Congress met to count the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\u201cI took the opportunity in the right settings, private moments, to share with him those times when we differed on issues,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd my hope is, whether it\u2019s the vice president or others, that there are those voices around the president that do the same.\u201d",
      "The former vice president demurred when asked how he thinks the current vice president is doing in his job, with Pence simply saying he \u201cwould have a hard time assessing that precisely, but [Vance is] an honorable man.\u201d",
      "Foreign policy",
      "Pence also spoke about Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy in this term. He told Welker it\u2019s \u201ca bad idea\u201d for the president to accept a plane as a gift from the Qatari royal family, amid reports that Trump plans to do so, and was critical of Trump\u2019s speech in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The former vice president also questioned the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Iran, as top U.S. officials seek to reach a deal with Iran over the nation\u2019s possession of uranium and nuclear technology.",
      "Pence said he is worried about reports that Iran is seeking to maintain a civilian nuclear program, telling Welker the U.S. \u201cshould make it clear in negotiations with Iran that their current nuclear program must be either dismantled or destroyed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am grateful that President Trump has reiterated the policy of our administration, that Iran will not be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon. The security of America, the security of Israel, the stability of the region and the world demands that we enforce that. But from my standpoint, when I hear talk about allowing Iran to have an enrichment program at a certain level, it sounds for all the world like President Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal that we got out of in the first year of our administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to make it clear to them that America is not bluffing, that we will not allow them to continue to enrich uranium,\u201d Pence added.",
      "Asked whether an attack against Iran should be on the table as an option to push it to dismantle its nuclear program, Pence said, \u201cOf course. I think all options should be on the table.\u201d",
      "Pence also said he thinks additional sanctions against Russia should be on the table as Trump seeks the end of the country\u2019s war in Ukraine, though the administration has said such threats would damage the talks it has set up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met Vladimir Putin. My judgment is Vladimir Putin only understands strength,\u201d Pence said.",
      "Jan. 6 pardons",
      "Pence said \u201cI don\u2019t see that in my future\u201d when asked if he might run for president again, having sought the White House in 2023 without gaining much traction before he dropped out of the race. His break with Trump over the 2020 election results, which Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed were marred by fraud, also damaged his political standing in the Republican Party.",
      "Pence said Trump was wrong to issue a blanket pardon of people who faced charges for participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",
      "\u201cI will always believe by God\u2019s grace I did my duty that day to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and see to the peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Pence said, later drawing a distinction between some Jan. 6 defendants who \u201cjust walked through an open door, meant no harm, did no harm,\u201d and those charged with more serious crimes.",
      "\u201cBut individuals who broke into the Capitol, who assaulted police officers, I said that day and I believe to this moment should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Pence said."

      "Netanyahu said allowing some aid in would enable Israel to expand its new military operation, which began Saturday.",

The bombardment forced northern Gaza\u2019s main hospital to close as it reported direct strikes.",
      "Israel began the offensive \u2014 the largest since it shattered a ceasefire in March \u2014 with the aim of seizing territory and displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israel is pressuring Hamas to agree to a temporary ceasefire that would free hostages from Gaza but not necessarily end the war. Hamas says it wants a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a path to ending the war as part of any deal.",
      "\u201cWhen the Jews want a truce, Hamas refuses, and when Hamas wants a truce, the Jews refuse it. Both sides agree to exterminate the Palestinian people,\u201d said Jabaliya resident Abu Mohammad Yassin, who was among those fleeing the new offensive on foot or in donkey carts. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy on us.

      "Israel\u2019s military had no immediate comment. Its statement announcing the ground operations said preliminary strikes over the past week killed dozens of militants and struck more than 670 targets.

      "Hamas has refused to leave Gaza or disarm.",

      "Frustration in Israel has been rising. A small but growing number of Israelis are refusing to show up for military service, even risking imprisonment. Other Israelis have been displaying photos of children killed in Gaza during weekly rallies demanding a deal to free all hostages and end the war.",
      "The war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.",

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",

      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "With a little over three minutes to go in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinal matchup between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics, Knicks forward Mikal Bridges hit a short pull-up jumper to give New York a 111-104 lead.",
      "After trailing by as many as 14 points in the third quarter, the Knicks battled back to take the lead, and the tightly contested final quarter was critical to the series \u2014 either New York would go up 3-1 or lose its second straight and head to Boston tied 2-2.",
      "For the third time in the series, though, the Knicks would ultimately overcome a double-digit second-half deficit and win. And Bridges\u2019 midrange jumper was the shot that made everyone at Madison Square Garden realize what was about to happen.",
      "The World\u2019s Most Famous Arena erupted as a dejected Celtics team called a timeout and lumbered to their bench. Everyone from the celebrities courtside to the fans in the last row was on their feet, enjoying what longtime Knicks broadcaster Mike Breen called the franchise\u2019s most important win in 25 years.",
      "That\u2019s because for most of this millennium, there\u2019s never been a better time to be a New York Knicks fan.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s an incredible time in New York City and the best time ever to be a New Yorker,\u201d hip-hop legend and Bronx native Fat Joe tells NBC News. \u201cWhen the Knicks are winning and thriving, it\u2019s like a feeling of euphoria and magic.\u201d",
      "Joe adds, though: \u201cBut from 2001 to 2020, those were some painful memories. The Knicks would be competitive at times, but they would always lose games in the clutch and just break your heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey would raise your blood pressure too high sometimes, but that\u2019s what makes you appreciate the last couple years of greatness.\u201d",
      "Knicks fans certainly seem to appreciate this current team after spending two decades in the NBA wilderness. The Knicks on Friday dismantled the Celtics, who were heavily favored entering the series, by a score of 119-81 to advance to their first East Conference Finals in 25 years.",
      "Following a run to the Eastern Conference finals in 2000, New York spent the next 20 years floundering. From \u201901 to \u201920, the Knicks played in only 30 postseason games, posting a pitiful 9-21 record.",
      "In the last five years alone, the Knicks have played in 39 playoff contests, winning 21. It may not be a full return to glory, but it\u2019s at least a return to relevance for a franchise that made the playoffs in every season in the 1990s.",
      "The 2025 playoff run has featured the comebacks against the Celtics as well as a 21-0 run against the Detroit Pistons to win Game 1 in the first round and a series-clinching three by point guard Jalen Brunson. Those moments are now a part of Knicks lore.",
      "Joe, an MSG fixture who was in the building for Larry Johnson\u2019s iconic 4-point play in 1999 (\u201cI still get goosebumps thinking about that moment\u201d) is only one of the faithful seeing his patience pay off.",
      "\u201cI ride for my team through all the ups and downs,\u201d he says.",
      "So does Michael Ompod, a 29-year-old from Clifton, New Jersey, who has spent most of his life with his favorite basketball team being a laughingstock.",
      "\u201cI mean, when I was younger, it was the team to be made fun of,\u201d Ompod says. \u201cI was bullied by Nets fans back in the day. And for us to do good, it means a lot to me. Like something in the air is different.\u201d",
      "For a long time, it was quite easy to bully Knicks fans, as the team was often mired in some combination of poor management, ineptitude or overall poor play on the court.",
      "The 20 years before the recent playoff success brought with them the ignominious Isiah Thomas years, the failed promise of the Carmelo Anthony era, constant chants for owner James Dolan to sell the team, and some of the most baffling contracts in NBA history (sorry, Jared Jeffries).",
      "New York first hinted at a resurgence in 2021 when forward Julius Randle won Most Improved Player and led the team to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.",
      "The Knicks missed the playoffs in 2022, but that summer signed  Brunson, arguably the best free-agent signing in team history. Brunson signed a four-year, $104 million contract in \u201922, which ended up being absurdly good value for a player who has proved to be a superstar and the face of the franchise.",
      "Brunson has since signed a four-year extension that gave New York a second discount, taking less than a maximum contract to give the front office more flexibility in building around him.",
      "And the Knicks have taken advantage by making shrewd move after shrewd move, acquiring two-way wings such as Bridges and OG Anunoby, while trading Randle and guard Donte DiVincenzo for All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns before the season.",
      "The result was the best team in years. New York won 51 games in the regular season, its most since 2013.",
      "\u201cIt still feels surreal that we\u2019ve made it this far,\u201d Ompod says. \u201cI mean, coming from a Knicks fan, I love that we\u2019re doing good, but a part of me is just like, \u2018Oh, this is actually happening.\u2019 I mean, if the Knicks could win, anything\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The recent success is also creating a new generation of diehards, like Terrence Lacewell, a 22-year-old from West Long Branch, New Jersey.",
      "Lacewell comes from several generations of Knicks fans, but he\u2019s lived most of his life during the team\u2019s lean years. He heard stories from his grandfather and mother about the \u201990s and what it was like to watch New York battle with the Chicago Bulls and the Houston Rockets.",
      "At Game 4, wearing a Randle jersey and sitting in the last row of Section 420, Lacewell got to experience a legendary Knicks playoff at Madison Square Garden for himself.",
      "With only the WNBA\u2019s Liberty winning a major championship for New York since 2012, Lacewell believes there\u2019s an extra motivating factor for the city, which hasn\u2019t seen a Knicks title since 1973.",
      "\u201cWe all get up for a contender,\u201d Lacewell says. \u201cWe\u2019re so desperate, everyone is rooting for the New York team.\u201d",
      "Director Spike Lee, a fixture in the front row for decades and perhaps the team\u2019s most famous fan, was also at Game 4, arms outstretched when Bridges sent the crowd into a frenzy late in the fourth.",
      "When asked what it means to be a fan of the Knicks, Lee thinks back to the team\u2019s first championship in 1970. He shows off the championship ring belonging to Red Holzman \u2014 the coach who led New York to its only two titles in the \u201970s \u2014 and said he had to take it out of the vault to wear for Game 4.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI was at Game 7, May 8, 1970, the Willis Reed game. Also, the Walt Frazier game. I was 13 years old.\u201d",
      "Lee, now 68, may finally get a chance to update that ring collection this summer."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/emergency-contraception-morning-after-available-convenience-stores-rcna204952",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Morning-after pills are now stocked at thousands of highway gas stations, corner delis and 24-hour convenience stores in 48 states.",
    "story": [
      "Convenience stores are aptly named. They\u2019re stocked with essentials people need at all hours of the day or night, everything from a quart of milk to a package of condoms. But they haven\u2019t stocked contraception for women.",
      "That\u2019s slowly and steadily changing as an Oakland, California-based company, Cadence, has spent the last year stocking highway gas stations, corner delis and 24-hour convenience stores with its own emergency contraception brand called \u201cMorning After Pill,\u201d which prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or a birth control mishap.",
      "The first morning-after pills, a single dose of levonorgestrel, hit convenience store shelves in Texas in March 2024. Since then, according to company executives, the pills are in some 11,000 locations in 48 states.\u00a0South Dakota and Hawaii are the last holdouts. A zip code search found the product everywhere from an E-Z Mart in San Antonio to a deli in Walla Walla, Washington.",
      "Kate Voyten, the company\u2019s senior vice president of commercial operations, said that Cadence, which is also seeking Food and Drug Administration approval for its over-the-counter regular birth control pill, is trying to make it easier for women to control their sexual health.",
      "\u201cOur original goal was to transform contraception,\u201d she said. \u201cGet it everywhere there is a condom.\u201d",
      "About one-third of all prophylactics for men are sold at convenience stores, she noted, and yet the stores \u201chave nothing for females\u201d except tampons and pregnancy tests.",
      "Over-the-counter emergency contraception is a safe and effective synthetic hormone that\u2019s meant to be used when a condom breaks, a regular birth control pill is missed, or no birth control is used. It works by inhibiting or delaying ovulation and doesn\u2019t end an existing pregnancy or harm a fertilized egg that is already implanted in the uterus, according to the FDA. And it doesn\u2019t affect future fertility. Some patients may experience a later or earlier menstrual period and short-term spotting, headache, nausea, and fatigue.",
      "Availability in stores such as 7-Eleven and Circle K comes even as legislators in some Republican-led states have indicated they want a new level of scrutiny for contraception. It\u2019s been nearly three years since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion and that decision \u2014 handed down by the court\u2019s conservative majority \u2014 led to many Republican states, including Texas and Tennessee, to criminalize abortion.",
      "The fallout from state abortion bans cut off some women\u2019s access to contraception, since many abortion providers that were forced to close also provided birth control.",
      "In particular, hormonal birth control, which includes emergency contraception, has been under increasing attack from the religious right.",
      "A major legal victory by a conservative Christian legal group in Texas restricted minors\u2019 access to birth control in that state, and a Trump administration order freezing $65 million in family planning funds has threatened contraceptive access from Mississippi to California.",
      "While the Catholic Church has long opposed all forms of artificial birth control, leading anti-abortion groups such as Students for Life of America have ramped up their campaigns targeting emergency contraception, intrauterine devices, shots, implants, patches and birth control pills. The groups falsely claim that these methods are \u201cabortifacients\u201d that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman\u2019s uterus.",
      "In some states, such as South Carolina, Alabama, Texas, abortion is illegal as soon as an egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube, even before the zygote travels to the uterus and implants."

      "Two people died and more than a dozen others were injured when a historic Mexican naval training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City on Saturday night, Mayor Eric Adams said.",
      "Twenty-one people were injured, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson said early Sunday, and were taken to shore via small boat before being transferred to a hospital. Adams had previously said on X that 19 were hurt, two were in critical condition \u201cand 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries.\u201d",
      "Others were checked out, and divers were probing waters at the scene as a precaution, three police sources with knowledge of the incident said earlier.",
      "Adams said at a news conference Saturday night that the tall ship with 277 people on board suffered a mechanical mishap that caused it to veer into the bridge as it had set sail from Pier 17 en route to sea.",
      "\u201cThe pilot lost power of the ship,\u201d he said, adding that two crew members were on a mast and were injured in the collision.",
      "Chief Wilson Aramboles of the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Operations Division\u00a0said the collision happened at about 8:20 p.m.",
      "Inspectors were immediately dispatched to assess the condition of the bridge, the police sources said. New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the head of bridge division was at the scene, with a preliminary assessment concluding there were no signs of major damage.",
      "Adams said the bridge was open.",
      "Commercial traffic in the area was suspended, and the Coast Guard\u2019s Sector New York established a \u201csafety zone\u201d from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Manhattan Bridge, the Coast Guard spokesperson said.",
      "No one fell into the water, officials said at the news conference. The ship was ultimately headed to Iceland, Aramboles\u00a0said.",
      "Video from the scene showed two masts from the ship, lit up in incandescent colors as night fell, striking the bridge, with people on the mast hanging on.",
      "Another video before the bridge strike showed around 80 people standing across the ship\u2019s masts, seemingly secured via harnesses. The Coast Guard spokesperson said the boat lost all three masts during the crash.",
      "Witnesses interviewed by NBC New York said the boat, which at least one said was no stranger to the East River and local waters, appeared to have a party-like atmosphere with music.",
      "On shore after the collision, paramedics were seen wheeling away some of the injured on stretchers, some wearing neck braces. Onlookers could be heard chanting, \u201cMexico! Mexico!\u201d",
      "Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, a Mexican ambassador to the U.S., at the news conference identified the ship as ARM Cuauht\u00e9moc, a historic Mexican Navy training vessel.",
      "Though it\u2019s listed as a sailing ambassador for Mexico for next year\u2019s Sail4th 250 celebrations, a spokesperson for the event said in a statement Saturday night that the \u201cMexican Tall Ship Cuauht\u00e9moc is not one of the ships committed thus far to participate in next year\u2019s Sail4th 250 event.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson continued, \u201cChris O\u2019Brien, President of Sail4th 250, is deeply saddened by what he\u2019s learning about this evening\u2019s collision and is following the news with the injured sailors in his prayers.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s Seaport Museum on Pier 17 hosted the ship through Saturday, with public viewing scheduled during its five-day stay.",
      "The New York City-area Sail4th 250 events will celebrate America\u2019s 250th anniversary on July 4, 2026, with what is being billed as the largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.",
      "The U.K. nonprofit Sail Training International describes the vessel a being built in Bilbao, Spain, in 1981 and originally called \u201cCelaya.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was later acquired by the Mexican Navy as a training vessel for officers, cadets, petty officers and sailors,\u201d according to the group. \u201cCuauhtemoc sailed the world for thirteen years and in 1995 underwent a major refit of the ship and rigging.\u201d",
      "The NYPD said it was investigating the incident. Officials at the news conference said the National Transportation Safety Board would also probe the cause of the collision.",

      "\"She made the act of reading accessible, and I watched these women feel so empowered, and I think it opened up the possibility of reading for them in ways that they never would have gotten,\" he said. \"And as a little boy, I didn't know I was going to be a writer, but I think I saw that first.\"",
      "\"I said, 'I don't know what that is \u2014 books \u2014 but they can change the posture of somebody's mother so that they can stand a little taller and walk across and get a book with that kind of confidence,' because she gave them a ticket into the discourse,\" he continued. \"And that access means so much to me, especially as a first generation immigrant, as a first generation (person) to go to college, as an educator, it does the world.\""

You did not break her spirit, nor her smile, that lights up every room. You did not break the souls of a mother who gives the best hugs and plays the silliest games with our little girls. You did not break the woman who has made me a better man.\u201d",

      "At the same time, Shelton noted that he aims to remain true to himself as an artist through the process.",
      "\u201cWho I am as a country artist, I think I lean more traditional, probably, but I\u2019m always trying to find something new, push the boundaries a little bit,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cListen, I want that as badly as other people seem to. I\u2019m not going to stop trying to manifest that,\u201d she told TODAY.com on Tuesday.",
      "Whether another version of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d ever comes to fruition, Murphy said much of the cast has reunions of their own.",
      "\u201cWe all like try to keep in touch as much as we can,\u201d Murphy said, acknowledging their \u201cbeyond busy\u201d schedules. \u201cBecause it was such a special show for all of us. And we all love each other so much.\u201d",
      "Though the comedy, which ran for six seasons, wrapped five years ago, Murphy said she\u2019s still stopped on the street for one of her character\u2019s iconic lines. When Alexis would bicker with her brother (Dan Levy), she was known to memorably yell, \u201cEw, David!\u201d",
      "Murphy only actually said the line three times in the entire series, but her Valley Girl accent was so memorable that any \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan would recognize the phrase.",
      "When fans do remember the line, Murphy said it\u2019s sometimes \u201cscreamed in my face,\u201d while others firmly command the actor, \u201c\u2018Do it now.\u2019\u201d But, she told TODAY.com, she found a way out.",
      "\u201cNow I often just start going, like, \u2018No, how about you do it? And I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m just your support animal, and you can go for it.\u2019 And people tend to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a way out. I\u2019ve planted a little loop for myself.\u201d",
      "Now, Murphy stars in Season 2 of the Hulu drama \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as Imogen, a character far different from Alexis. But would the two ever be friends?",
      "\u201cThat is a very good question. No, I think Imogen would write Alexis off as a ditz \u2014 even though Alexis is not a ditz,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I think Imogen is a very judgy little minx, and I think she would make a pretty hard judgment and judge a book by its cover and never look back.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe relationship between Benny and Carmen is something that I felt with women my whole life, of them always being protectors for me,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cSo that feels very real.\u201d",
      "Skinner, who rose to stardom through his comedy and celebrity impressions on social media, says that while certain aspects of the show are true to his real-life experiences, it was important to him and showrunner Scott King to fill the cast with people that will surprise viewers.",
      "\u201cMaybe you think you know them in the pilot, but you don\u2019t,\u201d Skinner explains. \u201cAt a certain point, your life starts to feel kind of like boring and not that interesting \u2014 like, you have to make a TV show, you need stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo yeah, at a certain point, I was kind of like, \u2018OK, I feel like my coming out story and these relationships are in there,'\u201d he continues. \u201cBut now, let\u2019s go.\u201d",
      "King tells TODAY.com that when writing the script with Skinner, they weren\u2019t focusing on what situations would be the most dramatic or the most funny.",
      "\u201cWe just wanted it to be real,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd even in the most heightened moments we wanted to play it real.\u201d",
      "King adds that while they were discussing their shared college experiences, he was surprised by how similar they were.",
      "\u201cAs someone who graduated before Benny was even born, he and I, when we were talking about college, even though it was such different times, so different for gay men at those times, too, there was such a universality to our experiences,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where we were able to capture the comedy and the real.\u201d",
      "About those needle drops...",
      "Music plays a central role in the show, Skinner says, with tracks coming in from Lorde, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj.",
      "During a recent visit to Northwestern University, Skinner says he went to a sorority house, and some of the members asked about his show and its soundtrack.",
      "\u201cI said a few (songs) from the show, and they were like, \u2018Totally,\u2019\u201d Skinner recalls. \"And I was like, \u2018Wait. Oh, so it\u2019s like, a college bubble, like nothing has changed.\u2019 I love that.\u201d",
      "Charli XCX notably plays herself in the show and serves as an executive producer on the series.",
      "\u201cI always knew that she had to be the college concert. Because when I was in college, I went to the \u2018Sucker\u2019 tour alone, because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, because that\u2019s totally gay,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew it had to be her.\u201d",
      "When working on Charli XCX's role in the script, Skinner says he wanted to give her more than just a performance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we just wanted to slot her in \u2014 this is a comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, we want people to die and be surprised and also, maybe if we can, weave in some kind of cathartic moment for musicians who are singing their life\u2019s work to college kids who are on molly. Like, let\u2019s do this.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Charli XCX performs three of her older hits, \"Boom Clap,\" \"Boys\" and \"I Love It,\" while Benny starts to feel ill from a hazing incident in which he had to swallow several live beta fish. His bestie Carmen was forced to eat extremely cheesy Italian food (even though she's lactose intolerant), and the pair try to make it through the concert. But they both end up in bathroom stalls next to each other getting extremely sick during her performance.",
      "The juxtaposition of singing your life's work in front of hundreds of inebriated college students was a moment Charli XCX was plenty familiar with, Skinner says.",
      "\u201cWhen I sent it to her, she was like, 'I think I have said some of these things about playing \"Boom Clap\" at a college.' Like, \u2018Why are you guys making me do this 100 times a year?\u2019\u201d he recalls Charli XCX saying.",
      "\u201cI mean it was such a no brainer that she was genius and was gonna kill it, so we had to give her as much as we could,\" Skinner adds. \"And she did it in between \u2018Sweat\u2019 tour shows.\u201d",
      "Another music moment in \"Overcompensating\" that was inspired by Skinner's own life involves Lady Gaga\u2019s song, \u201cThe Edge of Glory.\u201d After having a strange experience at his school's secret society, Benny starts to have a panic attack and decides to go up to an openly gay student and ask him to hang out.",
      "While Benny's talking with the student, the opening notes of \"The Edge of Glory\" begin to play, a nod to what the track feels like in Skinner's own life.",
      "\u201cLike leaving high school, rolling up the windows and blasting that and sobbing on the way home \u2014 like, that\u2019s me,\u201d Skinner says of his experience with the song.",
      "\u201cI think every song in it, it\u2019s why we named the episodes after these songs,\" he adds. \"I feel like, in college, music is currency.\u201d",
      "\"Overcompensating\" is now streaming on Prime Video."

    "summary": "The directors and producer reflect on filming the late Tony Todd's poignant, last on-screen appearance in the new movie \"Final Destination Bloodlines.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains spoilers for \u201cFinal Destination Bloodlines.\u201d",
      "The most basic rule of any \"Final Destination\" movie is that, ultimately, no one survives \u2014\u00a0except for one character: The endlessly intriguing mortician William J. Bludworth, played by horror legend Tony Todd.",
      "So when Todd, of \"Candyman\" fame, passed away last November at 69, it was only fitting that this death-obsessed series gave him a sendoff as intriguing and memorable as the character he played.",
      "Todd's role as Bludworth in \"Final Destination Bloodlines,\" released May 16, was one of his final on-screen appearances, filmed just months before he passed away, directors Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky tell TODAY.com.",
      "\"What he developed with Bludworth is really special because it\u2019s the only piece of the franchise that continues,\" Lipovsky says, adding that he brought a degree of \"charm and mystery\" to the role that was \"delightful\" and inspired countless fan theories.",
      "The directors knew he was ill when they were crafting the story and with filming with him, Lipovsky explains.",
      "\"So we knew it was going to be his last 'Final Destination' movie and, potentially, his last film ever.\"",
      "They took that responsibility seriously and worked with Todd to create a backstory for his character that would help answer some lingering questions.",
      "But they also wanted to \"give him an opportunity to say goodbye to the character, to the audience and all the people that love everything that he's been doing,\" Lipovsky says.",
      "In the scene, Bludworth reveals that he's sick and knows his own time is limited. There are ways to cheat death, he tells the characters, but things are likely to get \"messy.\"",
      "Sooner or later, he says, death is coming for all of us. \"I intend to enjoy the time I have left,\" he tells them, \"and I suggest you do the same.\" He continues, \"Life is precious. Enjoy every single second. You never know when.\"",
      "The fact that Todd knew he was likely facing his final months in real life \"gave that scene real authenticity,\" says longtime \u201cFinal Destination\u201d producer Craig Perry, adding that it \"translated into one of the most poignant moments in the entire franchise.\"",
      "And Todd's contribution to the series was \"enormous,\" Perry tells TODAY.com. When initially casting the for the role, which first appeared in the original \"Final Destination\" in 2000, \"we wanted somebody who always looked like he had a secret that he wasn't telling, a sort of enigma behind his eyes,\" Perry says.",
      "In Todd, they found all that and more.",
      "\"We really felt that Tony had all of that gravitas and mystery in his very DNA,\" Perry says. \"His presence brought a sense of foreboding medicine mystery, and beyond that, he was able to have a playfulness that made the character fun to watch.\"",
      "Todd elevated basic exposition \u2014 and transcended typical \"magical Negro\" horror tropes. In fact, Stein says, part of their direction with the character was \u201cwanting to kind of explode that trope and show that, no, Bludworth was a real person.\u201d",
      "In the previous movies, Bludworth has been a \"mysterious mentor figure, so (Todd) was very excited to show how he knows so much about death \u2014\u00a0as a real person,\" Stein explains. \"It's not because he's an angel or death itself,\" he continues, \"it's because he had this experience in his life.\"",
      "Taking the idea even further, Bludworth tells this latest crop of young people trying to deceive death that they aren't the first who have come to him for advice \u2014\u00a0and he's done with all that.",
      "\"That was to comment on even how cinema has changed a bit,\" Stein says. \"Like, we're not doing that anymore.\"",
      "While filming, Todd was \"just so incredibly joyful,\" Stein recalls. He was physically weak, but \"so excited,\" he says. Todd especially wanted to take photos with the actors who play Bludworth's mother and child self, Stein says, as his characters in other films often didn't get such fleshed-out backstories.",
      "And when it came time to perform his final speech, the directors told him to \"throw the script away for a moment and just speak from the heart,\" Lipovsky says. \"It was a unique opportunity for him to speak in character to what's happening in the story, but on a secondary level, be speaking to the audience about himself.\"",
      "The take in the film is the one Todd improvised.",
      "\"Even the way that he says 'Good luck' and winks at the camera as he walks out and starts whistling is sort of his own gift of talking about heavy things, but with a dark and delightful charm,\" Lipovsky says. \"The whole cast and crew couldn't believe that he had given us that.\""

    "story": [
      "A day after Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, alleged that Blake Lively \u201cdemanded\u201d Taylor Swift release a statement supporting her, Judge Lewis J. Liman has had the accusations stricken from the case.",
      "On Thursday, May 15, Judge Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial between the two \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars set for\u00a0March 9, 2026, in New York \u2014 described Freedman's letter as \"improper\" and said it \"must be stricken,\" in a court ruling obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "\"It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,\" Judge Liman wrote.",
      "He continued, \"The sole purpose of the Letter is to 'promote public scandal' by advancing inflammatory accusations, on information and belief, against Lively and her counsel. It transparently invites a press uproar by suggesting that Lively and her counsel attempted to 'extort' a well-known celebrity.\"",
      "At the end of Judge Liman's statement, he added, \"Counsel is advised that future misuse of the Court\u2019s docket may be met with sanctions.\"",
      "Lively's spokesperson sent a statement to TODAY.com reacting to Judge Liman granting the request of the Lively's legal team to remove Freedman's allegations from the record.",
      "\u201cIt took the court less than 24 hours to see through Mr. Freedman\u2019s irrelevant, improper and inflammatory accusations, strike them, remove them from the court and warn Mr. Freedman that further misconduct may be met with sanctions,\u201d Lively's spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Freedman for a comment.",
      "Liman's decision regarding Freedman's accusations is the latest development involving\u00a0the legal battle between the two former co-stars.\u00a0Following Swift\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0addressing the pop star reportedly being subpoenaed\u00a0in Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal back-and-forth, Freedman filed\u00a0a letter\u00a0with\u00a0Judge Liman on May 14, in which the attorney wrote that the purpose of the subpoena was to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",
      "Freedman further described the alleged demands as \u201cinappropriate and apparently extortionate threats\u201d and said a representative for Swift responded to them in \u201cat least one written communication\u201d sent to Gottlieb.",
      "\u201cIt is those communications that the Wayfarer Parties seek to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyer continued.",
      "TODAY.com obtained a statement from Gottlieb regarding Freedman\u2019s letter to the judge, in which he called the accusations \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively's lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Swift\u2019s rep for a comment, as well.",
      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",
      "According to NBC News, one alleged text from Lively read, \u201cIf you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you\u2019ll appreciate that I\u2019m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

    "summary": "Oliver Stark unpacks the ending of \"9-1-1\" Season 8, including if Buck is moving or leaving the 118.",
    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This article contains spoilers from the \"9-1-1\" Season Eight finale, \"Seismic Shifts.\"\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8",
      "In typical \"9-1-1\" fashion, Season Eight ended with a bang \u2014 well, several.",
      "After starting the season with a bee-nado (a tornado composed of bees, for anyone wondering), the Season Eight finale saw the 118 race to a more familiar scene: an infrastructure collapse.",
      "The 118, still reeling without its captain, splits off in pairs at the scene of the high-rise building collapse, with Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds) and Howard \u201cChimney\u201d Han (Kenneth Choi) rescuing several tenants, as Evan \u201cBuck\u201d Buckley (Oliver Stark) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) go to what's left of the upper levels.",
      "LAPD Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) was on scene when the apartment complex started crumbling down. She rushes back in to help, finding two pinned tenants in the building's laundry room. As their conditions worsen, she sends a survivor to get help, and Chimney joins her.",
      "But with the team still inside, the unsteady building continues to shake, rocked with mini-explosions, leaving Buck and Ravi trapped with a victim and Chimney and Athena's exit route completely blocked.",
      "For Buck, it marks a very different circumstance than one of the team's last big emergencies. In Episode 14, all of the 118 were locked inside a lab \u2014 except for Buck.",
      "\"I think he's almost more comfortable being trapped as long as he's able to do his job,\" Oliver Stark tells TODAY.com of the finale. \"Being on the outside was the most jarring thing for him.\"",
      "The lab disaster notably ended with the shocking death of Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause). Quarantined in the lab, members of the 118 were exposed to a deadly virus. Chimney was infected, and he was saved via Athena and Buck\u2019s heroics to acquire an antidote. But Bobby \u2014\u00a0Athena\u2019s husband \u2014 was also infected and died in the lab.",
      "In the finale \u2014\u00a0back to true \"9-1-1\" fashion \u2014 the 118 and Athena save the day, with no further casualties.",
      "Here's how it all goes down (literally) \u2014 and, as Stark says, how the circumstances are hopefully introducing a more \"mature\" Buck looking ahead to the show's already-renewed Season Nine.",
      "How does '9-1-1' Season 8 end?",
      "The 118 has since seemingly fallen apart in the aftermath of Bobby's death. While they showed a united front at Bobby's funeral in Episode 16 \u2014 with Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman) returning from El Paso, Texas, after moving earlier in the season to be with his son \u2014 they are each grieving separately in the most recent episodes.",
      "Chimney and Athena, both struggling with Bobby's sacrifice, can barely stand to be in the same room. Meanwhile, Buck and Eddie have another fight, with Eddie accusing Buck of being selfish about Eddie's new job opportunity in El Paso amid his grief.",
      "For the 118, Episode 18 opens on a somber note. All gathered at the station, the team throws a going away lunch for Eddie, who's set to report for duty at an El Paso firehouse the next morning. He's given his turnout uniform, and he and Chris enjoy one last shared meal with the team. Hen says she's turned down taking the job of captain, while Buck reveals he's put in for a transfer.",
      "\"Out of the 118?\" Eddie asks.",
      "\"It's just a number now,\" Buck responds.",
      "The team then heads to the call at the building collapse. Stark says being in the thick of the action is Buck at his best.",
      "\"There are different sides of Buck, and some of them are a bit sillier. I don't know, he's just like guileless and golden retriever-y, but there is no doubt that he's an extremely adept firefighter,\" Stark says. \"So I think him being in the emergency is where he's going to thrive and be able to do his best. I think it's a chance as well to see this more mature, calmer, 'let's get to work' version of Buck.\"",
      "While the rest of team rescues victims, Eddie is packing up his gear and preparing to head to the airport with Chris to go back to Texas. Eddie then sees reports of the building collapse and the search-and-rescue response on the news. Donning his familiar uniform, he heads toward the rubble, just in time to save Buck, Ravi and one of the victims before the building collapses further.",
      "\"I was watching the news, had a bit of FOMO,\" Eddie tells Buck over the radio, before shooting a line gun to their location, allowing the trio to escape.",
      "Stark says for Buck, that moment of Eddie coming to save the day represents a return to the status quo.",
      "\"I think just a case of things getting back to the way they're meant to be, and as we touched on, maybe never being quite the same, but the steps to repair slowly being built,\" Stark tells TODAY.com of Eddie's save.",
      "The team, Eddie included, then head to rescue Athena, Chimney and their patients. In the end, everyone makes it back alive, with zero civilian casualties from the building collapse.",
      "After the emergency and back at the station, Chimney notices the team rapidly splitting off despite their success as a united front. Eddie checks his phone looking for a flight back to El Paso while Buck puts away his turnouts. An emboldened Chimney orders everyone to stop moving and tells Eddie he's not leaving L.A. and Buck that he's not transferring.",
      "\"This is our fire house. This is the 118, and it's not just a number. It's us,\" an emotional Chimney tells the team. \"... Cap is gone. But leaving won't change that. It won't make you feel any less sad. It just means that you'll be sad all alone.\"",
      "He rounds out his speech with strict orders for everyone \u2014 Buck and Eddie included \u2014 to get some rest before reporting for their next shift \"right here, together.\"",
      "A shocked Hen responds, \"Copy that, Cap \u2014 I mean, Chim,\" suggesting the 118 might not have to look far in Season Nine for its next leader.",
      "Asked what stops Buck from considering leaving the 118, Stark tells TODAY.com, \"It's not really his decision.\"",
      "\"It's very much told to him,\" Stark says. \"'Put your stuff down. Get to work. This is where we live.' And it's what I think everybody needs to hear.\"",
      "Eddie being ordered to stay brings in the literal question of living situations.",
      "In Episode Nine, Buck moved into Eddie's house as a subletter so Eddie could follow Chris to El Paso. Since Eddie's return to L.A. for the funeral, he's been staying on Buck's couch in his old house.",
      "In regards to their dynamic as roommates, Stark jokes, \"Apparently they work out who's going to do the groceries and then they don't always follow through on that.\" (In Episode 17, Buck and Eddie's fight occurred in the kitchen and started after Buck picked up the groceries though Eddie said he would.)",
      "\"They work a lot of hours. That's the one thing as well. I don't think they spend a lot of time at home,\" he adds of Buck and Eddie's time as roommates. \"So yeah, that is for the audience to fill in the blank for themselves.\"",
      "In the final minutes of Episode 18, it's revealed that Eddie and Chris have moved back, Buck is looking for a new apartment and Athena is putting the now-finished house she had been building with Bobby on the market.",
      "After he's asked by his realtor why he's leaving his last place, Buck says, \"It wasn't really mine. I was subletting.\"",
      "\"Buck is looking for his own place again, and I just think that he's ready to \u2014\u00a0kind of the combination of everything's that's been happening through the season \u2014\u00a0the old apartment, the loft, is gone. This is Eddie's place. Who am I going to be, stand on my own two feet?\" Stark says of what Buck is looking for.",
      "A move may prove disheartening to longtime supporters of a potential romance between Buck and Eddie. Earlier in Season Eight, the show introduced the possibility onscreen for the first time after Buck reconnects with his ex, who insinuates he'd be open to getting back together \"now that the competition's (Eddie) is out of the way.\" Buck was later point blank asked by sister Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is he was in love with Eddie, which he adamantly denied.",
      "\"You know when something huge happens, your personal dramas, they just, everything falls by the wayside a little bit,\" Stark says. \"I don't know if that will be addressed next year or what.\"",
      "Asked if Buck continued to think about that question before Bobby's death, Stark says he thinks Buck \"shut it down.\"",
      "\"I don't think the idea is that Buck went home and looked in the mirror and said, 'Wait, am I in love with Eddie?' I think it came so far out of left field for him when Tommy first said it,\" Stark says. \"I don't think the idea is that we were saying Buck now is questioning if that's true.\"",
      "\"And, you know, look, (showrunner) Tim (Minear) will make that decision if it is or not,\" he adds. \"But I don't think in that moment that the story was now Buck is wondering if he is. I think Buck thought, 'No, you're absolutely wrong. What are you talking about?' And yeah, we'll go from there.\"",
      "Overall, Stark says he hopes Bobby's death in Season Eight will give him a chance to play a more \"mature Buck\" going forward.",
      "\"I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage,\" he says. \"So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.\""

      "For six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw chased after commitment while wearing Manolos and writing her weekly column. Ironically, at the beginning of \"Sex and the City,\" it was Sarah Jessica Parker who hemmed and hawed over signing the dotted line.",
      "The 60-year-old actor spoke about her early hesitation during a two-part appearance in the \"Are You a Charlotte?\" podcast, hosted by longtime \"Sex and the City\" co-star Kristin Davis. Speaking to Davis, Parker explained why she \"panicked\" at the idea of \"committing\" to the series, even after she shot the show's pilot, which first aired in 1998.",
      "As Parker explained it, the experience of filming the show's first episode was \"lovely,\" but she \"forgot all about it\" until one day, she was walking down a street in New York City when she ran into a well-known producer who complimented her on the show.",
      "\"Then I went on with my day, and when the show was picked up, I panicked,\" she recalled. \"I was like, I can\u2019t be on a TV show. I don\u2019t think I'm suited for that life.\"",

      "\"Then I moved on and I would do a play or I'd do some readings and then I'd do a part in a movie,\" she explained. \"I really thought, like that is the goal, like the journeyman is the goal.\"",

      "\"I talked to my agents and I said, 'You know, hey, can you get me out of this?'\" she recalled before noting that, eventually, she learned that because HBO was still relatively new and an \"unknown species\" to many, she had the benefit of flexibility.",

    "summary": "Taiwan's youth are stuck. There's growing concern in Taipei over the reliability of the Trump-led U.S. as a security partner, even despite Chinese aggression.",
    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

    "story": [

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday his cabinet approved a decision to allow a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food into Gaza. Israel imposed a complete blockade on humanitarian aid starting on March 2.",
      "Netanyahu said allowing some aid in would enable Israel to expand its new military operation, which began Saturday.",
      "It was not immediately clear when aid would enter Gaza, or how.",
      "Netanyahu said Israel would work to ensure that Hamas will not control aid distribution and ensure the aid does not reach Hamas militants.",
      "Saturday's \u201cextensive\u201d new ground operations in the Gaza Strip started amid airstrikes in a new offensive that killed at least 103 people, including dozens of children, overnight and into Sunday, hospitals and medics said. The bombardment forced northern Gaza\u2019s main hospital to close as it reported direct strikes.",
      "Israel began the offensive \u2014 the largest since it shattered a ceasefire in March \u2014 with the aim of seizing territory and displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israel is pressuring Hamas to agree to a temporary ceasefire that would free hostages from Gaza but not necessarily end the war. Hamas says it wants a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a path to ending the war as part of any deal.",
      "\u201cWhen the Jews want a truce, Hamas refuses, and when Hamas wants a truce, the Jews refuse it. Both sides agree to exterminate the Palestinian people,\u201d said Jabaliya resident Abu Mohammad Yassin, who was among those fleeing the new offensive on foot or in donkey carts. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy on us. We are tired of displacement.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military, which recently called up tens of thousands of reservists, said the ground operations are throughout the Palestinian territory\u2019s north and south. Israel\u2019s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, said that plans include \u201cdissecting\u201d the strip.",
      "Before the announcement, airstrikes killed more than 48 people \u2014 including 18 children and 13 women \u2014 in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which said it struggled to count the dead because of the condition of bodies.",
      "In northern Gaza, a strike on a home in Jabaliya killed nine members of a family, according to the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency services. Another strike on a residence there killed 10, including seven children and a woman, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government.",
      "Israel\u2019s military had no immediate comment. Its statement announcing the ground operations said preliminary strikes over the past week killed dozens of militants and struck more than 670 targets. Israel blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates from civilian areas.",
      "Shortly afterward, Israel\u2019s military said that it intercepted a projectile from central Gaza and another fell in an open area, with no injuries reported.",
      "Talks in Qatar",
      "Israel had said it would wait until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East before launching its offensive, saying it was giving ceasefire efforts a chance. Trump didn\u2019t visit Israel on his trip that ended Friday.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office said his negotiating team in Qatar was \u201cworking to realize every chance for a deal,\u201d including one that would end fighting in exchange for the release of all remaining 58 hostages, Hamas\u2019 exile from Gaza and the disarmament of the territory.",
      "Hamas has refused to leave Gaza or disarm.",
      "Israel ended the previous eight-week ceasefire in March. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry has said almost 3,000 people have been killed since then.",
      "Days before resuming the war, Israel cut off all food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza. The blockade is now in its third month, with global food security experts warning of famine across the territory of more than 2 million people.",
      "Frustration in Israel has been rising. A small but growing number of Israelis are refusing to show up for military service, even risking imprisonment. Other Israelis have been displaying photos of children killed in Gaza during weekly rallies demanding a deal to free all hostages and end the war.",
      "The war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.",
      "Hospital cites Israeli \u2018siege\u2019",
      "Health officials said fighting around the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza and an Israeli military \u201csiege\u201d prompted it to shut down. It was the main medical facility in the north after Israeli strikes last year forced the Kamal Adwan and Beit Hanoun hospitals to stop offering services.",
      "\u201cThere is direct targeting on the hospital, including the intensive care unit,\u201d Indonesian Hospital director Dr. Marwan al-Sultan said in a statement, adding that no one could reach the facility that had about 30 patients and 15 medical staff inside.",
      "Israel\u2019s military said that troops were operating against militant infrastructure sites in northern Gaza, including the area \u201cdirectly adjacent\u201d to the hospital.",
      "Israel has repeatedly targeted hospitals, accusing Hamas of being active in and around the facilities. Human rights groups and U.N.-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s health care system.",
      "In northern Gaza, at least 43 people were killed in strikes, according to first responders from the Health Ministry and civil defense. Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital said 15 children and 12 women were among the dead.",
      "A drone strike Sunday afternoon killed at least seven Palestinians near a school sheltering displaced people northwest of Gaza City, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.",
      "Other strikes in central Gaza killed at least 12 people, hospitals said. One in Zweida town killed seven people, including two children and four women, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah. Another hit an apartment in Deir al-Balah, killing parents and their child, the hospital said.",

    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran.

    "summary": "South Africa has a dark history of racism, including confiscating land from Black residents, before and during the anguish of apartheid.",
    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted. Or that there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance returned to Rome for the inaugural Mass of Pope Leo XIV, continuing a spiritual journey that has weathered criticism from leaders of the Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 After leaving the Marines and beginning his higher education, Vice President JD Vance drifted into atheism \u2014 struggling, he would eventually write, with feelings of \u201cirrelevance\u201d in his faith and with \u201ca desire for social acceptance among American elites.\u201d",
      "Vance, who later converted to Catholicism, this weekend made his second trip to the Vatican in less than a month. On the first visit, Vance met with Pope Francis on Easter, hours before he died. On Sunday, Vance led a U.S. delegation at the inaugural Mass of the first U.S.-born pope, Leo XIV.",
      "Both pontiffs \u2014 Francis during his papacy, Leo in his prior service as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost \u2014 offered veiled but easily decipherable rebukes of President Donald Trump and Vance\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview. Vance, somewhat uncharacteristically for someone who so relishes debate, has chosen to politely sidestep criticism. But the circumstances of the last few weeks have put an unexpected spotlight on his religion, reinforcing his status as one of the world\u2019s highest-ranking Catholics in political office.",
      "At Sunday\u2019s Mass, the vice president scored a prime seat in the first row to the right of the dais, near delegations from Italy and Peru, where the pope is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop and archbishop.",
      "In his homily, delivered in Italian, Leo spoke of \u201ctoo many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth\u2019s resources and marginalizes the poorest,\u201d according to an English translation provided by the Vatican.",
      "Vance and second lady Usha Vance briefly greeted the pope before leaving the Vatican on Sunday.",
      "\u201cOf course, the American pope \u2014 the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him,\u201d Vance said during the opening of a trilateral meeting Sunday afternoon in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "The White House was eager to frame this weekend's visit in historic terms.",
      "\u201cPope Leo XIV is the first American Pope. Vice President Vance is the first Catholic convert to serve as Vice President,\u201d Vance\u2019s office emphasized when announcing the trip.",
      "Vance is the second Catholic to serve as vice president, after Joe Biden, who went on to become the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden grew up in the Catholic Church, while Vance came to it as an adult. Joining Vance in Rome and at the Vatican this weekend was Father Henry Stephan, the priest who baptized him in 2019.",
      "After landing in Rome at sunset on Saturday night, Vance\u2019s motorcade first sped to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where he and the second lady paid their respects at Francis\u2019 tomb.",
      "In February, Francis sent a letter to U.S. bishops that was viewed by many as a scolding of Trump\u2019s immigration policy in general and of Vance\u2019s justification of it in particular. Vance responded by trying to defuse any tensions. Speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast that same month, Vance said that while Francis\u2019 criticism surprised him, the pope was \u201cfundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership.\u201d",
      "The remark came after Vance, who is known for his combative online presence, lamented to his audience that the rise of social media was unhealthy for religious discourse. (Vance excused Trump\u2019s recent post featuring an AI image depicting the president as the pope as a joke.)",
      "\u201cWe are not called as Christians to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should frankly take a page out of the books of our grandparents, who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance, but didn\u2019t obsess or fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Vance struck a similar tone this month after Leo\u2019s election as pope drew attention to stories he had shared on social media as a cardinal that were critical of Trump and Vance. While wrestling with Leo\u2019s politics in an interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Vance offered a nuanced answer and said he prefers \u201cnot to play the politicization of the pope game.\u201d",
      "Yet for all of Vance\u2019s social media bluster, he telegraphed years before his vice presidency that the papacy is an authority that he is reluctant to cross.",
      "In a 2020 essay he wrote about his conversion in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance recalled confronting \u201ca conservative Catholic writer about his criticism of the pope.\u201d Vance asserted that \u201ctoo many American Catholics have failed to show proper deference to the papacy, treating the pope as a political figure to be criticized or praised according to their whims.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s conversion is a less plumbed part of his past. Aside from The Lamp essay and thoughts he shared with a conservative writer friend who attended his baptism, away from public audiences, Vance has talked rather sparingly about his spiritual journey.",
      "At the Catholic prayer breakfast in February, Vance noted his interfaith marriage to Usha, who is Hindu, and how they are raising their three children Catholic while allowing them to decide when to be baptized. He said his most exciting moment last November \u2014 the month he was elected vice president \u2014 was when his 7-year-old son chose to be baptized.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there is a lot I don\u2019t know,\u201d Vance said that day. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith baby Christians. And I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic, that there are things about the faith that I don\u2019t know. And so I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith publicly, because of course I\u2019m not always going to get it right.\u201d"

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",
      "For the 25 artists who didn\u2019t win, there\u2019s still the hope that they\u2019ll have found new fans.",
      "Holly-Anne Hull, a member of this year\u2019s British act, Remember Monday, told NBC News in a Zoom interview last month that for her group, the outcome is secondary to the opportunity to be able to perform together on the world stage.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t even doing it for the live show. We\u2019re doing it for the fact that we can live in this band every single day up until that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we\u2019ve ever dreamed of is doing this band full time.\u201d"

Oleh Hryhorov and Ukraine\u2019s national police. The Associated Press couldn\u2019t independently verify the report. There was no comment from Moscow.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the attack as \u201cdeliberate killing of civilians,\u201d adding in a post on Telegram messaging app that \u201cRussians could scarcely not realize what kind of vehicle they were hitting.\u201d",

      "Impact on peace efforts?",
      "Russian and Ukrainian officials met Friday in Istanbul in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended after less than two hours without a breakthrough. It was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two sides since the early weeks of\u00a0Moscow\u2019s February 2022 full-scale invasion\u00a0of Ukraine.",
      "Hopes for a breakthrough were dashed after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0spurned Zelenskyy\u2019s offer\u00a0to meet face-to-face in Turkey. Putin\u2019s no-show came days after he himself proposed negotiations in Istanbul \u201cwithout preconditions,\u201d as an alternative to the \u201cfull and unconditional\u201d ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S.",
      "While both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.",
      "One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. The Kremlin has pushed back against such a truce, which remains elusive.",
      "Zelenskyy said he had discussed the outcome of the Istanbul talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland. In a post on X from a\u00a0European leadership meeting in Albania\u00a0on Friday, he urged \u201ctough sanctions\u201d against Moscow if it rejects \u201ca full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.\u201d",
      "Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their\u00a0biggest such swap. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Ukrainian TV on Saturday the exchange could happen as early as next week.",

      "Marked by high-level talks and lavish displays of regional hospitality, the trip showcased Trump\u2019s self-styled role as a dealmaker and peacemaker. Still, his loftiest targets \u2014 resolving the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 remain elusive.",
      "In Abu Dhabi, Trump capped his weeklong tour with a visit to Qasr Al Watan, the emirate\u2019s presidential palace, where he toured exhibits showcasing investments in energy, health care and aviation. Accompanied by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the president met with business leaders and took shots at his predecessor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said, taking a swipe at former President Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing this? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d A large screen at the event repurposed his campaign slogan to proclaim \u201cMaking Energy Great Again,\u201d a nod to the economic focus of the trip.",
      "Throughout the week, Trump announced major investments by Middle Eastern nations in American businesses, including a $600 billion investment deal from Saudi Arabia and an agreement with Qatar Airways to buy hundreds of planes from Boeing and GE Aerospace.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields lauded the trip as an \"incredibly formative visit that forged America\u2019s Golden Age through its partnerships with a critical region of the world.\"",
      "The visit came amid controversy over Trump's eagerness to accept a planned gift from the Qatari government: a $400 million luxury plane which he hopes to use as Air Force One. The offer has drawn backlash from Democrats and some Republicans back home over potential ethical, security and financial challenges.",
      "Trump repeatedly dismissed concerns about the plane, saying he \"thought it was a great gesture.\" He also brushed off accusations that the trip, which came as his namesake company expands into the Middle East, created a potential conflict of interest.",
      "Yet, even as he celebrated his economic victories, the president faced the reality upon departure of the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, conflicts he has vowed to resolve.",
      "The president has made ending some of the world\u2019s thorniest conflicts a top priority of his administration, vowing to stop the bloodshed and bring about a lasting peace. And in a show of strong commitment, he has dispatched top aides to the cause, with special envoy Steve Witkoff hopscotching the globe in pursuit of the president\u2019s goal.\u00a0Before departing Washington, Trump announced the release of Edan Alexander, an American held by Hamas, with Qatar playing a central role in the negotiations.",
      "However, the president acknowledged that significant challenges remain. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left Abu Dhabi. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201d",
      "As Trump concluded his trip Friday, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 100 people in the last 24 hours, according to local health authorities.",

      "Earlier, Trump had expressed disappointment but not surprise when Putin failed to attend a planned meeting in Turkey. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to go if I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Trump said, noting that his schedule had made the trip untenable.",
      "Instead, he teased the near possibility of a breakthrough in nuclear talks with Iran. Trump told reporters Friday that his administration had submitted a proposal for a deal with Tehran, after describing earlier their efforts \u201cin very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace.\u201d Earlier in the week, Trump hinted that he hoped an agreement was near, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said later Friday that his government had not \"received any written proposal from the United States\" and that there was \"no scenario\" in which Tehran would abandon its nuclear program to reach a deal with the U.S.",
      "\"Iran nonetheless remains determined and straightforward: Respect our rights and terminate your sanctions, and we have a deal,\" he said on X. \"Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] signatories, too.\"",
      "Trump also said Friday that recognizing the new Syrian government \u2014 and lifting what he called \"brutal\" and \"biting\" sanctions \u2014 was \"the right thing to do\" as the new leadership cements its control.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that the trip did not sideline Benjamin Netanyahu by forgoing a visit with the Israeli prime minister, explaining that his relationships with Arab leaders are \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d He also said he reached out to Netanyahu on the decision to lift sanctions on Syria.",
      "Analysts see parallels between this trip and Trump\u2019s 2017 Middle East tour.",
      "\u201cThe key thing to watch is what comes next in the region and what big steps his administration takes,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. After 2017, the Gulf region saw a rift that isolated Qatar for three years and a U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran that he said failed to deliver lasting results. Yet, the trip also laid the groundwork for the Abraham Accords, the 2020 agreement normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states, which remains Trump\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement and which Biden sought to continue.",
      "Trump is aiming higher. \u201cThis time around, Trump is looking for a historic breakthrough with Iran on the nuclear talks and also dreams of getting a Nobel Prize if he gets that Iran deal or expands the Abraham Accords to include a Saudi-Israeli normalization accord,\u201d Katulis said.",
      "Trump\u2019s hosts this week have also played important roles in these efforts, helping to mediate the conflicts and offering support to negotiations, and the president acknowledged there was more to do as he departed Abu Dhabi.",
      "\u201cUnexpected surprises and events have a way of knocking U.S. administrations off balance,\u201d Katulis said. \u201cThe ongoing war in Gaza and the growing misery of Palestinians living there will be a critical test.\u201d"

      "According to Jason Wong, who has been associated with Temu's product logistics in Hong Kong, the company has paused shipments from China after the end of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfill orders.",
      "Under the latest tariff policy, Wong anticipates that bulk shipments subject to the 30% tariff rate will resume to the U.S., replenishing these stockpiles.",
      "\u203330% is still high, but compared to 125%, 30% is basically nothing,\u201d he added.",
      "Small values, higher levies",
      "The tariffs situation nevertheless remains more complicated for small-value packages under \u201cde minimis.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0latest policy update\u00a0retains a $100 flat fee per postal item, while scrapping a previously planned increase to $200 starting in June, according to an\u00a0executive order released by the White House\u00a0on Monday.",
      "According to Wong, for Temu to resume its small-value shipments from China to the U.S., the tariffs still need to be relaxed further \u2014 something he expects will happen eventually.",
      "Shein has not said that it is ending direct shipments from China. However, it says on its platform that \u201ctariffs are included in the price you pay.\u201d",
      "The reduction in tariffs on low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight\u2019s Kumar.",
      "In anticipation of changes to the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as\u00a0Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.",
      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",
      "The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.",
      "The U.S. government had briefly suspended the exemption in February before reinstating the provision days later, as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a spate of low-value packages.",
      "U.S. rivals like Amazon, on whose platform many third-party sellers offload products sourced or assembled by Chinese manufacturers, are also expected to ramp up shipments during the 90-day window, trade experts said.",
      "\u201cAll the companies are just going to scramble to get everything they can into the country as quickly as they can,\u201d said\u00a0Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consultancy firm Tidalwave Solutions. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same boat.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Fans from around the world have descended upon the 69th Eurovision Song Contest to rally behind performers from their home countries who have been battling it out onstage all week.",
      "In total, there are 26 performances in the grand final: the countries that got through the semifinals, plus the host country (this year, Switzerland) and a group called the Big Five \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2014 which enter the final automatically because their countries make the biggest financial contributions to Eurovision.",
      "As the artists gear up for an extravagant, glitter-dusted pop song contest featuring their wildly over-the-top performances, thousands of spectators gather at Eurovision Village, a convention center that\u2019s been turned into a hub for fans. Some drape national flags on their backs, others paint the flags on their faces. Many find themselves dancing until the early hours at the EuroClub, which plays nothing but Eurovision hits.",
      "The event is what members of the Remember Monday group representing the U.K. called a cultural phenomenon, likening it to the Super Bowl in the U.S.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows what it is,\u201d Holly-Anne Hull said. \u201cAnd everyone, whether they like it or not, is aware of who\u2019s won it every year.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what else to know.",
      "How to watch and vote",
      "Performers will battle it out during Saturday\u2019s grand final, which airs at 3 p.m. ET on Peacock for viewers in the U.S.",
      "The winner of the contest is decided by a mix of votes from national juries of music professionals and viewers watching at home. People all around the world can vote for the winner using the contest\u2019s app or online.",
      "Who are this year\u2019s favorites?",
      "Gambling on Eurovision is big business, and sports betting firms \u2014 who give their two cents on the odds of each contender \u2014 have a decent track record of identifying which songs will do well at Saturday\u2019s grand final.",
      "This year, the favorites include Sweden, which has won the contest seven times since the first Eurovision in 1956. The group KAJ, a trio of Swedish-speaking Finns, is entering this year with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d an ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The song, which features staging re-creating a sauna complete with dancers in towels, is the most-streamed song by far from this year\u2019s contest, according to Spotify.",
      "Another top contender is Austria. Singer JJ, an opera singer, uses extraordinary vocal range to hit high notes throughout his song, \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "The Dutch entry is also considered a front-runner. Singer Claude\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d has a mixture of French and English lyrics, and it\u2019s this year\u2019s third most-streamed song of the nominees on Spotify.",
      "Other eye-catching numbers to watch for",
      "Eurovision songs cut across genres, and while many wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a Top 40 radio playlist, sometimes they stand out for wild lyrics or eye-popping staging.",
      "In addition to the Swedish sauna song, this year\u2019s entries include Icelandic act V\u00e6b. The blond brothers don oversized silver outfits and jewel-encrusted sunglasses and energetically jump around the stage during their song \u201cR\u00f3a,\u201d which is about rowing a boat.",
      "Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman singing about a \u201clust trance\u201d while wearing thigh-high leather boots in \u201cIch Komme.\u201d The song reaches its climax with Vikman on a giant microphone stand suspended in the air with sparks flying out of it.",
      "Being weird doesn't guarantee a spot in the final, though. This year's Irish entry was a dance anthem imagining a world in which Laika, the Soviet dog who died after being sent to space, not only lived but \u201chas a party in the air\u201d and \u201cis dancing every night among the stars.\u201d It didn't make it past Thursday's semifinal.",
      "Have there been any controversies?",
      "As was the case last year, Israel\u2019s participation has drawn protests over the country\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip. This year\u2019s contestant, Yuval Raphael, survived the Hamas-led terror attack on the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the attacks.",
      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said in a statement that the EBU, which organizes the contest, \u201cis not immune to global events but, together with our Members, it is our role to ensure the Contest remains \u2014 at its heart \u2014 a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is not our role to make comparisons between conflicts,\u201d he added, noting that the EBU \u201cremains aligned with other international organizations that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time.\u201d",
      "The entry from Malta also prompted controversy for its lyrics to Miriana Conte\u2019s song, \u201cServing.\u201d The original version featured the Maltese word for \u201csinging,\u201d which sounds like a vulgar word in English. That word has been omitted in the reworked version. The singer posted on her Instagram that the EBU had made her change the words.",
      "In a statement to Sky News, NBC's British partner, at the time, the EBU said that \"if a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are given the opportunity to modify it, or select a new one, before the deadline as per the rules of the Contest.\"",
      "The Italian consumer group Codacons also filed a complaint over offensive stereotypes in Estonian Tommy Cash\u2019s \u201cEspresso Macchiato,\u201d which includes lyrics that reference \u201csweating like a mafioso\u201d and being \u201caddicted to tobacco.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Eurovision did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Estonia\u2019s entry.",
      "A major surprise appearance could be in store",
      "A question on many people\u2019s minds is whether C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 yes the C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 will make an appearance.",
      "The award-winning artist was 20 years old when she won the competition for Switzerland back in 1988. (Although she is Canadian, artists don\u2019t need to be from the country they represent. For example, this year, the Swedish entry is from Finland and the Irish entry is from Norway.)",
      "Dion appeared in a video at Tuesday\u2019s semifinal saying she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to appear at the contest. The singer has been public about her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis and gave an emotional performance at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Paris last year.",
      "Asked via email by NBC News about the possibility of Dion appearing in person at Saturday\u2019s final, Eurovision spokesperson Sibylle Tornay said, \u201cThere are currently no changes regarding C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 we are still in close contact with her, of course her health is the most important thing and comes first.\u201d"

      "Despite the flurry of activity from Russian, Ukrainian, American, British, French and German diplomats, the negotiations lasted barely two hours and did not appear to bring the sides closer together. There was one point of agreement \u2014 a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners each, the head of Russia\u2019s delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said. It would be the largest swap since the start of the war.",
      "With Russia still issuing demands that resemble an outright Ukrainian surrender, some observers see these talks as largely an attempt by both Moscow and Kyiv to pursuade President Donald Trump they are not the obstacle to peace.",
      "Before they even began, President Donald Trump predicted there would be no progress unless he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were involved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything\u2019s going to happen whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart while speaking with journalists late Thursday aboard Air Force One en route to Abu Dhabi. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\u201d",
      "Trump said Thursday he wanted to meet with his Kremlin counterpart \u201cas soon as we can set it up.\u201d Asked what stood in the way, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that \u201csuch a meeting is certainly necessary\u201d but that first there must be \u201cexpert negotiations, consultations and long, intense preparation.\u201d",

      "The lopsided face-off saw Secretary of State Marco Rubio arriving at the palace despite a no-show from his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

      "Today, the gulf between the two sides' demands remains as wide as the Bosporus that cleaves Istanbul in two.",
      "Russian officials say they see the talks as a chance to restart what they call \u201cpeace negotiations.\u201d In reality, their conditions for peace \u2014 halting the war Russia started by invading Ukraine in February  2022 \u2014 are tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender. Kyiv has said it will never accept these terms, which include agreeing never to join NATO and agreeing to permanent \u201cneutrality\u201d between Moscow and the West.",
      "NBC News asked the Russian team Thursday whether Putin is prepared to compromise \u2014 there was no answer.",
      "Ukraine instead wants a 30-ceasefire as a basis on which to build future diplomatic wins. Its European supporters say that they will hit Russia with further sanctions if it does not agree. Though often accused of being far softer on Russia than on Ukraine, Trump has also suggested he could hit Putin with sanctions if he feels not enough progress is being made.",
      "The talks in Istanbul are shrouded in \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank.",

      "Eyal likens the negotiations to \u201ca game of musical chairs \u2014 when the music stops, who remains standing?\u201d That is to say: \u201cWhen Mr. Trump finally loses patience, who does he blame for failing to achieve a ceasefire? That\u2019s the whole game.\u201d",
