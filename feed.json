      "VENICE, Italy -- Some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which kicks off on Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of everything you need to know about the festival, the Oscar buzz and who\u2019s going.",
      "It\u2019s one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, second only to Cannes, and technically the oldest. Venice is also a reliably starry affair, gathering some of the best films in international cinema and often factoring into the Oscars race.",
      "The film festival was established in 1932, then a non-competitive event, by the La Biennale di Venezia, hosting films like \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d and \u201cIt Happened One Night.\u201d By 1935, they decided to make it an annual event. Suspicions that the festival was succumbing to fascist influences actually led to the establishment of the Cannes Film Festival, as an alternative, after the 1938 edition.",
      "The Golden Lion award as we know it today wouldn\u2019t be introduced until 1949 (\u201cRash\u00f4mon\u201d won in 1951). Other winners throughout history include \u201cBelle de jour\u201d (1967), \u201cAu revoir les enfants\u201d (1987), \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d (2005), \u201cSomewhere\u201d (2010), \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) and, last year, \u201cThe Room Next Door.\u201d",
      "The festival kicks off on Wednesday and runs through Sept. 6, when the awards will be announced. The opening night film is Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLa Grazia.\u201d",
      "Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler and Idris Elba are among the stars expected to grace the red carpets this year. It\u2019ll be the first time at the festival for both Roberts, starring in the #MeToo-themed drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d and Johnson, who transformed for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Other stars in the lineup include Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Jesse Plemons, Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colman Domingo, Amanda Seyfried, Callum Turner and Jude Law. Lifetime achievement award recipients this year include \u201cVertigo\u201d star Kim Novak and filmmaker Werner Herzog.",
      "After taking a year off, Netflix, still on the hunt for a best picture win, is back in full force with three major films in the main competition: Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s comedic drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d Also in competition are: Kaouther ben Hania\u2019s \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cBugonia,\u201d with Emma Stone; Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d; Jim Jarmusch\u2019s anthology film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d; Mona Fastvold\u2019s musical about the Shakers, \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d; Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d; and Olivier Assayas\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",
      "The buzz is strong for several out-of-competition films too, like Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d Julian Schnabel\u2019s \u201cIn the Hand of Dante\u201d and Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marc Jacobs documentary \u201cMarc by Sofia.\u201d",
      "Festival director Alberto Barbera thinks Venice\u2019s place in the Oscar race was solidified in 2012, when they hosted the premiere of \u201cGravity,\u201d which went on to win a leading seven Oscars that March and established Venice as a place to launch a campaign. It\u2019s only intensified as the membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has gotten more international. Since 2014, they\u2019ve hosted four best picture winners (\u201cBirdman,\u201d \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d).",

      "Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen. He doesn\u2019t even remember a time in his life when he wasn\u2019t aware of his music. But sing his songs? It wasn\u2019t until White began preparing to play the rock \u2019n' roll legend for \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d that he even tried.",
      "\u201cI had never really sang anything, never mind Bruce,\u201d White says. \u201cThere was a leap of faith that we were all taking.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an established playbook for music biopics. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d ignored all of it. The film, written and directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d \u201cBlack Mass\u201d), eschews the standard life-spanning, play-the-hits approach and instead focuses on a small portion of Springsteen\u2019s sprawling life: the making of his 1982 album, \u201cNebraska.\u201d",
      "The album, a minimalist masterpiece recorded on a four track in Springsteen\u2019s bedroom in Colts Neck, New Jersey, doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything like a glossy big-screen jukebox. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d instead, is aimed more at the soul of Springsteen. For the role, Cooper turned to who he considers one of the best actors of his generation \u2014 even though he had no singing experience.",
      "\u201cI remember early on speaking to Scott about the project and being really excited to do it with him but also telling him, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar and I\u2019ve never really sang before. Are we going to be able to figure out this together?\u2019\u201d White recalls. \u201cBut Scott had faith. And Bruce had faith. And we trusted each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d which 20th Century Studios will release Oct. 24 in theaters, is the first movie based on Springsteen\u2019s life. It was made with Springsteen\u2019s involvement; he gave input to on the script, on casting and attended several days on set. It\u2019s also the first leading movie role for White, the 34-year-old Emmy-winning star of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d who sings all the songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI knew that he had the two qualities that really embody Bruce: humility and swagger,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t teach swagger at Julliard. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I was never concerned. He\u2019s sensational.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d based on Warren Zanes\u2019 2023 book, co-stars Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau, Springsteen\u2019s longtime manager and record producer. Landau was also involved in the project from its inception.",
      "\u201cI knew that this was the first time Bruce had handed the wheel over to anybody to tell a story of his,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey were never directors in any way but were always there when I had a question. Of course, when you\u2019re Jeremy Allen White and you have Bruce Springsteen show up, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d",
      "For White, Springsteen was a great resource in a movie that aspired to authentic interiority. \u201cNebraska\u201d was a major departure for Springsteen. Its 10 songs spun tales of blue-collar workers soaked through with Springsteen\u2019s own childhood memories and reverberating with an American storytelling tradition running from Flannery O\u2019Connor to Woody Guthrie. Springsteen intended the raw demos to be later recorded with the E Street Band, but ultimately decided to release the unvarnished recordings.",
      "White sees the film, in part, as about the artistic process.",
      "\u201cHe was drawing inspiration from all these places but he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing for a while with this record,\u201d White says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you\u2019re doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.\u201d",
      "White first spent time with Springsteen in London, where he also attended a concert. The actor later spoke to Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's bandmate and wife of 34 years, and friends of the rock legend. After peppering Springsteen with questions during preproduction in New Jersey, White says he mostly kept his head down during the shoot.",

      "\u201cBruce is very gracious,\u201d White says. \u201cHe was trying to make himself as small as possible on set, but that\u2019s very difficult for Bruce Springsteen.\u201d",
      "The challenge musically was considerable. To prepare, White worked with vocal coach Eric Vetro (who a also trained Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d ), guitar instructor J.D. Simo and music supervisor Dave Cobb. For White, a turning point came when they went to RCA in Nashville to record most of the songs over a 48-hour period.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s where I found my confidence,\u201d White says. \u201cI\u2019m in this recording studio. It\u2019s a very large room, you\u2019re kind of by yourself. And I got to sing Bruce\u2019s songs over and over again. I remember feeling closer and closer to the man.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cAtlantic City\u201d was initially the song White gravitated toward, the one that ended up striking a chord was \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d one of Springsteen\u2019s most stirring and plaintive ballads.",
      "\u201cI remember each time singing that song and understanding it more thoroughly,\u201d says White. \u201cLearning something new each time, just going deeper each time.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d will arrive at a time when Springsteen has ratcheted up his criticism of President Donald Trump. At a concert in May, Springsteen told the audience: \u201cThe America I love, the America I\u2019ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d Trump responded by calling Springsteen \u201cnot a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious jerk.\u201d",
      "Cooper and White have a much different impression from their time with Springsteen.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people with his level of success and notoriety and fame, a public person decade after decade, can remain so in touch and available and honest with people day after day,\u201d White says. \u201cWhat was important to him remains his art, yes, but it\u2019s his family and Patti. All of his morals are right in line \u2014 what I consider to be right in line.\u201d",
      "Says Cooper: \u201cBruce isn\u2019t just a musician. He\u2019s the symbol of something that\u2019s uniquely American. The blue-collar poet. The reluctant moral conscience. I think to make a film about Bruce is to make a film about America\u2019s soul. The power of that lies in his emotional honesty and his work resonates across all political lines because he tells the truth.\u201d",
      "Cooper wasn\u2019t just speaking theoretically. Making \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d coincided with multiple tragedies for the director. His father died the day before shooting began. During the last week of production, he lost his house in the Palisades fire in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cJeremy and Bruce and a really wonderful crew and cast of actors lifted me up and carried me through to the finish line,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have a place to live, Bruce moved my family into his place in Los Angeles. And Jeremy was there on some of my darkest days. The movie, for me, has a particular resonance.\u201d",

      "James Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 James Cameron recently turned 71 as he brought his third \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d to the finish line.",
      "Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago. He started working on the first film in earnest 20 years ago. Production on \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which ran concurrently with 2022's \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d got underway eight years ago.",
      "By any measure, \u201cAvatar\u201d is one of the largest undertakings ever by a filmmaker. It's maybe the only project that could make \u201cTitanic\u201d look like a modest one-off. Cameron has dedicated a huge chunk of his life to it. Now, as he prepares to unveil the latest chapter of his Na'vi opus on Dec. 19, Cameron is approaching what he calls a crossroads.",
      "\u201cAs you get older you start to think of time in a slightly different way,\u201d Cameron says from his 5,000-acre organic farm in New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s not an infinite resource.\u201d",
      "Two more \u201cAvatar\u201d films are already written and have release dates, in 2029 and 2031. Right now, though, Cameron is focused on completing \u201cFire and Ash,\" which is almost guaranteed to be the biggest movie of the fall. To get \u201cAvatar\u201d \u2014 a franchise already worth $5.2 billion in worldwide tickets sales \u2014 back in the minds of moviegoers, \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d will also be rereleased Oct. 3.",
      "\u201cAs I told the brass at Disney, we\u2019re right at the glide slope to land right on time for delivery,\" Cameron says. \u201cThe first film was a nightmare. Movie two was hectic. But here, I keep having to pinch myself because it\u2019s all going well. The film is strong.\u201d",
      "There may be no filmmaker more at the nexus of past and future blockbuster making than Cameron. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d will arrive as Hollywood is reconciling itself to a new theatrical normal. In a movie industry of shrinking ambition, \u201cAvatar,\u201d an original spectacle that once was the wave of the future, is already beginning to look like an endangered species.",
      "In a recent interview, Cameron reflected on his history with \u201cAvatar\u201d and what's next for him, including a planned adaptation of Charles Pellegrino's \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima.\u201d For Cameron, most of his work is likely to touch on one of what he calls \u201cthe big three\u201d: Nuclear weapons, machine super intelligence and climate change.",
      "\u201cAvatar,\u201d a family saga that grows more complicated and darker in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d relates to the latter. The films are environmental parables, set in a verdant faraway world. Sustainability, community, connection to nature \u2014 these are some of the pillars of Cameron's life right now, in the movies and outside them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a humble movie farmer,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cwho\u2019s also a farmer farmer.\u201d",
      "CAMERON: It was sort of: Do the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga or follow my interests more. I knew that \u201cAvatar\u201d would be all-consuming, and it has been. When I set down that path, a reasonable projection was eight to 10 years to get it all written and do movie two and movie three together and get them out. But it\u2019s actually turned out to be more than that. It was a major commitment and decision to make for me as a life choice. But the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies reach people and they reach people with positive messaging. Not just positive about the environment but positive from the standpoint of humanity, empathy, spirituality, our connection to each other. And they\u2019re beautiful. There\u2019s a kind of magnetic draw into the film. It almost feels like it\u2019s being pulled out of the audience\u2019s dreams and subconscious state.",
      "CAMERON: I was 19. I was in college and I had a very vivid dream of a bioluminescent forest with glowing moss that reacted to your feet and these little spinning lizards that floated around. It\u2019s all in the movie, by the way. The reason it\u2019s in the movie is because I got up and painted it. That later became the inspiration, just a few years later, for a science-fiction script. I said, \u201cHey I got this idea for a planet where everything glows at night.\u201d We wrote that in and it never went away.",
      "Years after that, when I was the CEO of Digital Domain, I wanted to push Digital Domain to be able to create CG worlds, CG humanoid creatures using performance capture. I just threw the kitchen sink into the treatment called \u201cAvatar.\u201d So it came from almost a Machiavellian reason. I was trying to drive a business model for the development of CG. Of course, the answer I got from my technical team was: \u201cWe are not ready to make this film. We may not be ready for years.\u201d But it still served that inspirational purpose, which was: Well, how do we get ready?",

      "CAMERON: It\u2019s interesting. As I said earlier, \u201cAvatar\u201d has been all-consuming. In the process, we\u2019ve developed many new technologies. I enjoy the day-to-day process with a team. I\u2019ve surrounded myself with really intelligent, really creative people who enjoy the process of the world building. We enjoy leveling up in our working process. It\u2019s a long, steady state thing where I\u2019m not having to create a new startup, build a team and then disband that team \u2014 the way the movies cycled for me back in the \u201980s and \u201990s. Now, I\u2019m at a kind of a crossroads where I have to decide if I want to keep doing this.",
      "Four and five are written. If we\u2019re as successful as we might potentially be, I\u2019m sure the films will continue. The question for me will be: Do I direct them both? Do I direct one of them? At what point do I pass the baton? How pervasive do I want it to be in my life?",
      "CAMERON: I\u2019m not going to make any decisions about that until probably Q2 of next year, when the dust has settled. And there are also new technologies to consider. Generative AI is upon us. It\u2019s going to transform the film business. Does that make our work flow easier? Can I make \u201cAvatar\u201d movies more quickly? That would be a big factor for me.",
      "CAMERON: The theatrical business is dwindling. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t continue to dwindle. Right now, it\u2019s plateaued at about 30% down from 2019 levels. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get cannibalized more. In fact, let\u2019s hope we can bring some of that magic back. But the only way to keep that magic alive and strengthen it is to make the kinds of movies people feel they need to see in a movie theater. Unfortunately, those movies are not getting greenlit as much as they used to be because studios can\u2019t afford them. Or they can only afford to take the risk on certain blue chip stocks, so it doesn\u2019t allow new IP to get launched. It doesn\u2019t allow new filmmakers to come into those genres.",
      "I\u2019d like to see the cost of VFX artists come down. VFX artists get scared and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to be out of a job.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, the way you\u2019re going to be out of a job is if trends continue and we just don\u2019t make these kinds of movies anymore.\u201d If you develop these tools or learn these tools, then your throughpoint will be quicker and that will bring the cost of productions down, and studios will be encouraged to make more and more of these types of films. To me, that\u2019s a virtuous cycle that we need to manifest. We need to make that happen or I think theatrical might never return.",
      "CAMERON: I would love to think that we\u2019ve been building a new monument for the last three or four years. And I think there will always be a market for the new monument builds. The streamers kind of cannibalized the theatrical market with the promise of a lot of money to attract top filmmakers and top casts, and then that money has all retrenched back. The budgets aren\u2019t there. Everything is starting to look like it\u2019s driving toward a mediocrity. Everything starts to look to me like a typical network procedural, or at least that could be an end point within just a couple years.",
      "Unfortunately, the economics of streaming expanded rapidly and then contracted rapidly. Now, we\u2019re betwixt and between models. It\u2019s cannibalized theatrical and, at the same time, it\u2019s not delivering the budgets to do the kind of imaginative, phantasmagorical filmmaking.",
      "CAMERON: The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, and certainly the new one \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d do exactly the same thing. In a way, they cast us in a good light. The humans in the story are the bad guys. But really what it\u2019s saying is that the attributes we value \u2014 our interpersonal and intercommunity connections, our spirituality, our empathy \u2014 in the movies they reside in the Na\u2019vi. But of course we as the audience take the Na\u2019vi\u2019s side. So they seem a kind of aspirational, better version of us. In a sense, it\u2019s still empowering and reinforcing certain values and ethics and morals.",
      "Now, it\u2019s a little more challenging in movie three because we show Na\u2019vi who have kind of fallen from grace and are adversarial with other Na\u2019vi. I think one of the reasons \u201cAvatar\u201d has been successful in all markets around the world is because everybody is in a family or wishes they were in a family. They have their ties. They have their tribes. They have their connections. And that\u2019s what these films are about. What would you risk everything for?",
      "CAMERON: \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima\u201d is about testing our empathy boundaries. Somebody needed to be empathetic to the fact that a nuclear weapon was going to be used against human beings. And I don\u2019t want to go down the rabbit hole of should the bombs have been dropped, who was right, who was wrong. But I do want to remind people of what these weapons are capable of doing against targets. It\u2019s unfathomable.",
      "There were three bombs in 1945. One was used as a test and two against people. There are now 12,000 and they range in power from 100 to over 200 times the energy that was generated at either one of those two bombings. We\u2019re in a very precarious world right now. And because of all the geopolitical challenges internationally \u2014 more nuclear powers, more saber rattling, unaccountable leadership in Russia and America right now \u2014 I think we\u2019re in as precarious a situation as we were in the Cuban missile crisis era.",

      "Summer may be known as sequel season, but part twos, and threes, will play big roles this fall at the movies.

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking at a Russian film festival, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",
      "David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe, called it \u201ca completely unique two-day musical event.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Both films, which premiered simultaneously earlier this month, had a minimal 36% drop from last weekend.",
      "\u201cI think we have to look at the currency of the goodwill generated by people having these great summer moviegoing experiences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe have to look at that as a more important metric than just the bottom-line dollars and cents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" earned $5.9 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut but has experienced a steady decline.",
      "Newcomer \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d opened in 1,317 North American theaters with a weekend gross estimate of $3 million, in line with expectations. The movie made it to the top 10, right above \u201cThe Naked Gun.\"",

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \u201cpassed peacefully in his sleep,\u201d Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",

One night he retreated to the hotel\u2019s Gabbiano Bar where his friend, the legendary bar manager Walter Bolzonella, mixed him a drink of lemon, sugar, vodka, cranberry juice, ginger and Angostura bitters and named it Buona Notte in honor of the film. The two would later name a prosecco, passionfruit and elderflower cocktail La Nina after Clooney\u2019s mother, which was served at his wedding.",

      "This Coen brothers comedy featuring Clooney and Brad Pitt opted to debut out of competition in the opening night slot. He said it completed his \u201ctrilogy of idiots\u201d that he\u2019d played for the Coens, including \u201cIntolerable Cruelty\u201d and \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d \u201cLooking at the parts we are playing, I\u2019m very concerned about what you think of us,\u201d Clooney said at the press conference. Pitt, who\u2019d won the festival\u2019s acting prize the year prior, added: \u201cLike George \u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I should be flattered or insulted.\u201d",
      "Another opening night, out of competition slot debut for this Clooney-directed campaign thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman. As usual, Clooney was peppered with political questions in which he observed that, \u201cit\u2019s a very difficult time to govern.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d opened the 70th edition of the Venice Film Festival before going on to win seven Oscars. Clooney, of course, attended the premiere alongside Sandra Bullock and he was self-deprecating about his role: \u201cThere were only two parts and Sandy had the other one, so I felt like this was the only one I could get away with.\u201d",
      "The canals were packed with paparazzi for the nuptials of one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite bachelors. On Sept. 27, Clooney, then 53, and Alamuddin, then 36, exchanged vows in front of 100 of their closest friends and family, including Bono and Matt Damon, at the luxury hotel Aman Grand Canal, originally a grand palazzo built in 1550. She wore a custom Oscar de la Renta dress, of French lace, pearls and diamant\u00e9 accents. He wore a black wool/cashmere Giorgio Armani tuxedo.",
      "Clooney returned to the festival with another of his directing projects, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d a dark comedic satire about a seemingly idyllic 1950s community with Damon and Julianne Moore. This festival was especially notable for it being the Clooneys\u2019 first public appearance since the birth of their twins, Alexander and Ella, a few months prior.",
      "This time George was the plus one to Amal, who was receiving an award from the Diane von Furstenberg and The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation for her work as a human rights lawyer. The power couple gave the festival some much-needed star power amid the actors strike with an appearance at the adjacent DVF Awards. \u201cI am here in Venice with my husband; he is a rising star,\u201d she said that night. \u201cI just wanted to say, you, my love, like this city, take my breath away.\u201d",
      "Clooney and Pitt reunited for the Jon Watts action comedy \u201cWolfs,\u201d that played out of competition. But the spotlight was less on the film and more on the off-screen drama of the AppleTV+ produced film only getting a limited theatrical release, and his then-recent New York Times op-ed urging President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",

It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com. And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors are urging a federal judge to quickly reject Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 request that he throw out a jury verdict or order a new trial after a jury convicted the music maven of two prostitution-related charges.",
      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",
      "The Mann Act charges each carry a potential penalty of 10 years behind bars. Combs has been denied bail despite his lawyers' arguments that their client should face little to no additional jail time for the convictions. Prosecutors said he must serve multiple years behind bars.",
      "Combs has been in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest at a Manhattan hotel. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 3.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that Combs' attorneys were mistaken when they contended in a submission to the judge late last month that the Mann Act was unduly vague and violates his due process and First Amendment rights.",
      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said he then used video recordings he made of the sexual events to threaten and coerce the girlfriends to continue participating in the sometimes weekly or monthly sexual meetings.",
      "\u201cAt trial, there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s convictions,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "They said Combs \u201cmasterminded every aspect\u201d of the sexual meetups, paying escorts to travel across the country to participate and directing the sexual activity that took place between the men and his girlfriends \u201cfor his own sexual gratification\u201d while sometimes joining in.",

She said she participated in hundreds of \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "A woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d said she participated in \u201chotel nights\u201d when she dated Combs from 2021 to last September and that the events sometimes lasted multiple days and required her to have sex with male sex workers, even when she was not well.",
      "Both women testified that Combs had threatened to release videos he made of the encounters as a way of controlling their behavior.",
      "\u201cDuring these relationships, he asserted substantial control over Ventura and Jane\u2019s lives. Specifically, he controlled and threatened Ventura\u2019s career, controlled her appearance, and paid for most of her living expenses, taking away physical items when she did not do what he wanted,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "\u201cThe defendant similarly paid Jane\u2019s $10,000 rent and threatened her that he would stop paying her rent if she did not comply with his demands,\u201d they said.",
      "In their submission requesting acquittal or a new trial, Combs' lawyers argued that none of the elements normally used for Mann Act convictions, including profiting from sex work or coercion, existed.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time. Honestly, I\u2019ve been working on this album for almost five years,\u201d said the R&B-pop superstar. \u201cI put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, as they would say, into this project \u2026 I literally gave birth to two babies while I was making this project, too. So, a lot has happened.\u201d",

So, it\u2019s not like I was five years chillin',\u201d said the \u201cLevel Up\u201d artist. \u201cIf I ever stop loving the process and experience, then I'll stop. But I have so much passion for it and I just feel so fortunate that 21 years later, from my first album \u2018Goodies\u2019 to now, that I still have the same excitement I had as a little girl.\u201d",
      "Her eighth studio album, \u201cCiCi\u201d includes songs from the EP such as \u201cHow We Roll,\u201d her 2023 Chris Brown collaboration which reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s R&B digital song sales charts, \u201cForever\u201d with Lil Baby and the sensual bop, \u201cLow Key.\u201d But the 14-track full-length record, with writing and production from Theron Thomas and J.R.

      "In an era where music is often released rapidly, Ciara's leisurely pace has been questioned by fans and critics, wondering if she\u2019s traded her love for music for a perceived socialite lifestyle with her Super Bowl-winning husband, Russell Wilson.",
      "\u201cI feel like I don\u2019t have to explain anything to anybody,\u201d said the \u201cRide\u201d singer, who's recently released collaborations with several Asian artists. \u201cNot every year has been about music. And sometimes, it\u2019s been about me just growing as a human. Sometimes, it\u2019s been about me finding my way obviously as a mom, and then I have family now and my husband, being there for him. These are all real things.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a perception she aims at on \u201cRun It Up\u201d with BossMan Dlow, singing, \u201cNo matter how many points I put up on the board, you know they gon\u2019 hate / I\u2019m in a league of my own, I\u2019m a wife and a mom / \u2026 You ain't gotta worry, you know that we straight.\u201d",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Alaska medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care for children could risk disciplinary action under a proposal set for review by the state medical board on Friday.",
      "The proposal would deem any professional who uses hormonal and surgical treatments for minors \u201cas being grossly negligent\u201d and subject to sanctions by the board, according to the board\u2019s minutes from a June meeting.",
      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",
      "The move comes after the board in March sent a letter to state lawmakers expressing opposition to hormonal or surgical gender-affirming care for minors and urging legislators to enact limits on treatments. The Legislature \u2014 controlled by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate \u2014 didn\u2019t take up the issue before adjourning in May.",
      "Critics worry the board is overstepping its authority in pursuing regulations that could leave medical providers open to possible disciplinary actions. Instead of allowing the legislative process to play out, \u201cthey are now becoming the legislators themselves, which is inappropriate,\u201d said state Sen. L\u00f6ki Tobin, a Democrat who has been outspoken in support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "The medical board at a June meeting designated member Heilala to help draft a statement for consideration that would pertain to declaring those providing the care \u201cas being grossly negligent and therefore subject to disciplinary sanctions,\u201d according to the minutes of that meeting.",
      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",
      "Most major medical groups say access to the treatment is important for those with gender dysphoria and see gender as existing along a spectrum. While there\u2019s wide, if not universal, medical consensus, the political situation is contentious.",
      "In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had issued an order allowing the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse. But a Texas judge in 2022 blocked the state from investigating families of transgender youths who have received such care and members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over such medical care.",

      "Chinese officials have showcased what they claim will be the world's largest solar farm on the Tibetan plateau",
      "TALATAN, China -- Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.",
      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",
      "But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. \u201cThere's still a long road ahead,\u201d he said.",
      "A seemingly endless expanse of solar panels stretches toward the horizon on the Tibetan plateau. White two-story buildings rise above them at regular intervals.",
      "In an area that is largely desert, the massive solar project has wrought a surprising change on the landscape. The panels act as windbreaks to reduce dust and sand and slow soil evaporation, giving vegetation a foothold. Thousands of sheep, dubbed \u201cphotovoltaic sheep,\u201d graze happily on the scrubby plants.",
      "Wang Anwei, the energy administration chief of Hainan Prefecture, called it a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation on multiple levels.",

      "Like many of China\u2019s solar and wind farms, it was built in the relatively sparsely populated west. A major challenge is getting electricity to the population centers and factories in China\u2019s east.",
      "\u201cThe distribution of green energy resources is perfectly misaligned with the current industrial distribution of our country,\u201d Zhang Jinming, the vice governor of Qinghai province, told journalists on a government-organized tour.",
      "Part of the solution is building transmission lines traversing the country.",
      "One connects Qinghai to Henan province. Two more are planned, including one to Guangdong province in the southeast, almost at the opposite corner of the country.",
      "Making full use of the power is hindered by the relatively inflexible way that China's electricity grid is managed, tailored to the steady output of coal plants rather than more variable and less predictable wind and solar, Myllyvirta said.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that the policymakers have recognized and are trying to manage, but it does require big changes to the way coal-fired power plants operate and big changes to the way the transmission network operates,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s no small task.\u201d",

      "Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin did not cite a reason for the removal of General Nicolas Torre as head of the 232,000-member national police force, a position he was appointed to by Marcos in May and which he would have held until 2027. He will be replaced by another senior police general, Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. who assumed the top post Tuesday.",

      "Ahead of his removal, Torre reportedly had differences with government officials over the national police chief\u2019s decision to remove more than a dozen police officials from their posts, including Nartatez. The National Police Commission ordered the reinstatement of the police officials to their posts this month but that was apparently not immediately done.",

Duterte, who ended his six-year presidential term in 2022, has been accused of a crime against humanity for the brutal campaign against illegal drugs when he was in office and which left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead in police-enforced crackdowns that alarmed the United States, other Western governments and human rights watchdogs.",

      "This summer, divers descended about 8 meters (26 feet) below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a 13.2 million euro ($15.5 million) six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",

      "That has left the international community further blinded to Iran\u2019s program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Iran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others say Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
      "The Europeans agreed with the U.S. earlier this year to set an end-of-August deadline for invoking the mechanism if Iran fails to meet several conditions, including resuming negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, allowing U.N. nuclear inspectors access to its nuclear sites and accounting for the over 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium.",
      "The \u201csnapback\u201d provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal can be invoked by any party if they find Iran out of compliance with requirements. Its purpose is to swiftly reimpose all pre-deal sanctions without being vetoed by U.N. Security Council members, including permanent members Russia and China.",
      "Iran contends there is no legal basis for the Europeans to reimpose U.N. sanctions via snapback, claiming the countries failed to uphold the 2015 Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. exit in 2018, especially ensuring the anticipated economic benefits for Iran.",

      "\u201cIf you come to the U.K. illegally, you will be detained and deported and never, ever allowed to stay, period,\" Farage told a press conference.",

      "Farage, who has long sought to link problems such as public healthcare and housing to migrant arrivals, reiterated his stance that the U.K. is being \u201cinvaded\u201d by migrants. He said he would introduce policies to mass deport hundreds of thousands of people over the first five years of being in government.",
      "Reform will leave the ECHR and repeal or \u201cdisapply\u201d all other rights treaties to bar all asylum claims and ensure migrants who arrive without authorization are deported, he added. It will scale up the capacity of detention facilities and secure deals with countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran, to return migrants.",
      "Asked about the prospect of asylum-seekers being tortured or killed if they were sent back to countries they fled from, Farage said: \u201cThe alternative is to do nothing ... We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.\"",

      "Iran's Revolutionary Guard is a powerful force that answers only to the country's supreme leader",

      "The force was in the spotlight Tuesday when Australia accused Iran of organizing two antisemitic attacks in the country. The allegation recalls earlier attacks and attempted assaults linked back to the Guard\u2019s Quds Force, its expeditionary arm. \u201cQuds\u201d is a word in both Arabic and Farsi for Jerusalem and reflects one of the force's key missions: confronting Israel.",
      "Here's more to know about the Guard.",
      "The Guard was born from Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution as a force meant to protect its Shiite cleric-overseen government and later enshrined in its constitution. It operated parallel to the country\u2019s regular armed forces, growing in prominence and power during a long and ruinous war with Iraq in the 1980s. Though facing possible disbandment after the war, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei granted it powers to expand into private enterprise, allowing it to thrive.",
      "The Guard's Quds Force was key in creating what Iran describes as its \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d against Israel and the United States. It backed Syria's former President Bashar Assad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis and other groups in the region, growing in power in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.",
      "U.S. officials say the Guard taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against U.S. troops there. The Quds Force, as well as Iranian intelligence agencies, are believed to have hired criminal gangs and others to target dissidents and Iran's perceived enemies abroad.",
      "Since the Israel-Hamas war, Israel has arrested citizens it has accused of receiving orders from Iran to surveil targets or conduct vandalism. Iran has denied being involved in those plots. The Guard is also believe to be heavily involved in smuggling throughuot the Mideast.",

      "After making its announcement about Iran, Australia warned its citizens in Iran to immediately leave if they were able, noting they closed their embassy and that \u201cforeigners in Iran, including Australians and dual Australian-Iranian nationals, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest.\u201d",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- For the first time, Britain's government has agreed to pay out millions in pounds to Kenyans to settle a civil lawsuit after its military forces had their legal immunity in Kenya lifted.",
      "The payout of 2.9 million British pounds ($3.9 million) to settle damages for a wildfire accidentally started by British soldiers in Kenya in 2021 follows a landmark ruling that stripped the U.K. government and British Army of immunity from Kenyan civil suits.",
      "That has opened a new chapter in accountability for foreign militaries' actions on Kenyan soil, and the British military deployment in the country faces a series of controversies over the conduct of its personnel both in Kenyan and U.K. courts.",
      "Over 7,700 Kenyans and an environmental lobby group had filed a class-action suit before the Kenyan Environment and Land Court, accusing the British Army Training Unit in Kenya of destroying more than 12,000 acres of the Lolldaiga Hills in central Kenya 2021.",
      "The British government admitted that the fire had been started accidentally by a soldier\u2019s kerosene stove. The blaze took almost two weeks to put out and caused the death of one person and an unspecified number of animals.",
      "Locals said toxic fumes from the fire caused health issues, including respiratory complications and damaged eyesight.",
      "An environmental assessment presented before court showed that the fire caused extensive damage that would take between 30 and 50 years to tackle.",
      "The British government had argued that it had immunity from trial in Kenyan courts, but that was thrown out in a landmark ruling by High Court Judge Kossy Bor, who stated that the U.K. lost absolute immunity against trial in local courts when it entered into a defense treaty with Kenya.",
      "It was the first time Kenyan courts were able to try civil claims against British military forces.",
      "Kelvin Kubai, a Lolldaiga community legal representative, lauded the settlement, saying it sets a precedent for future claims and redefines diplomatic and military accountability in host countries.",
      "Many, however, expressed strong disappointment over the compensation amounts. Some residents say the payment is as little as 129 pounds for some, and say the payout falls far short of their 575-million pound demand.",

      "The political independence of the Fed is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the central bank to take unpopular steps, like raising interest rates.

      "The Women\u2019s Professional Baseball League will launch next year, becoming the United States' first pro women's baseball circuit in 70 years",
      "When Justine Siegal and Keith Stein envisioned the United States' first professional women's baseball league in 70 years, they wanted to do it right. So they examined the blueprints of successful women's leagues and studied the pitfalls that caused promising ventures to fail.",
      "Their research helped shape the Women's Professional Baseball League, launching next year, the latest in a wave of ventures looking to capitalize on the unprecedented rise in popularity of women's sports.",
      "For such a startup to be sustainable and profitable, mainstream recognition is key. Good salaries and financial incentives may attract star players who could draw crowds and all-important TV deals. But analysts warn that exposure on television doesn\u2019t guarantee success, and that a solid social media presence, strong branding and community development are imperative \u2014 along with a dose of good luck.",
      "At least eight women\u2019s pro leagues have launched in the past three years, including the WPBL, Unrivaled \u2014 a fast-paced 3-on-3 women's basketball league that debuted this year \u2014 and the Professional Women's Hockey League, seizing on rising viewership, bigger sponsorship deals and a fan base more eager than ever to support female athletes. Basketball is leading the surge, with college standouts like Caitlin Clark becoming household names and drawing record audiences for the WNBA.",
      "\u201cThere is a pipeline of women from around the world who are at the elite level and ready to showcase their abilities,\u201d said WPBL co-founder Siegal, the first woman to coach an MLB team, the Oakland Athletics, \"and there\u2019s a fan base ready to watch and ready to receive and cheer them on.\u201d",
      "Among the recent women's pro circuit additions are the PWHL, which wrapped up its second season in May, and soccer\u2019s Gainbridge Super League, which debuted last August. Volleyball entered the spotlight in 2024 with the launch of the Professional Volleyball Federation and League One Volleyball.",
      "Unrivaled, co-founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, finished its inaugural season with players' salaries averaging around $200,000 \u2014 the highest of any women\u2019s pro league. Fan engagement was high, with more than 11.9 million viewers tuning in to watch the games on TNT and truTV, signaling its long-term viability.",
      "\u201cOur strategy was very simple. We knew we could find success if we had the top players playing,\u201d said Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell, a basketball trainer and Collier\u2019s husband.",
      "\u201cThe pinnacle of women\u2019s sports, both from an economic standpoint and a star power standpoint, is women\u2019s basketball,\" Bazzell continued. \u201dSo we had this inherent advantage from day one with the star power to activate social media and all the things that we needed.\u201d",
      "While Unrivaled was able to leverage its players' popularity to fuel its success, launching a women\u2019s sports league has historically been an uphill climb. Leagues such as the WNBA and National Women's Soccer League have withstood years of hardship relative to their male counterparts.",
      "The WNBA, whose players have negotiated charter flights in recent years and are currently seeking major salary boosts, began 29 years ago fighting for support and visibility.",
      "\u201cThis is not an undertaking for the faint of heart,\u201d said Ed Desser, who has advised the NFL, NBA and PGA Tour on media rights. \u201cYou have to not only have a bunch of things going for you, but also be fairly lucky. Because today, you\u2019re not only competing with every existing sport, but you\u2019re competing, from a media consumption standpoint, with libraries full of the best content TV and film ever created.\u201d",
      "The environment for new women\u2019s sports ventures is far more favorable today than it once was, said Risa Isard, director of research and insights for Parity, a women\u2019s sports marketing platform.",
      "The rise of streaming services has opened new pathways to reach fans directly, bypassing traditional broadcast limitations and giving emerging leagues a better shot at building devoted audiences. Isard said there\u2019s also a wealth of data indicating women\u2019s sports can deliver strong returns, proving \u201cwomen\u2019s sports can be good business.\"",
      "Explosive growth in attendance and viewership in part led to the NWSL's $240 million, four-year media rights deal in 2023. The WNBA followed with an 11-year media rights deal in 2024, when the league had its best attendance in more than 20 years and saw viewership nearly triple from 2023.",

      "Beyond driving fan engagement, many women\u2019s sports leagues prioritize the wellness and needs of athletes. The six Unrivaled teams play all their games in a custom-built arena in Miami to help build a fan base and sense of community, while the league covers the cost of players\u2019 housing, rental cars and child-care. LOVB president Rosie Spaulding underscored the long-term importance of being athlete-centered, noting that LOVB athletes are considered league employees and have access to year-round health care.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s for sure more that needs to be done,\u201d Spaulding said, \u201cbut I am very encouraged with the path that we\u2019re on already and the changes that we\u2019ve seen over these last five years, and the return on investment that these brands continue to see.\u201d",

      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\u201cThis is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they\u2019ve been well trained,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million. The states did not immediately respond to the proposed sanctions that were announced before officials start their day on the West Coast.",

      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues aim for longevity, the question of team branding \u2014 which encompasses the nicknames and the color schemes and logos \u2014 is front and center",
      "On a cold day in the beginning of 2024, Alastair Merry and Mary Lou Bunn had a few questions for a public librarian in Ottawa, Ontario.",
      "\u201cIf you could describe Ottawa and what it means to you in a couple words, how would you do it?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhat do you think of the spirit of the city?\u201d",
      "Merry and Bunn, along with the design firm Flower Shop that they co-founded, were hired by the then newly minted Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League to create the nicknames and logos for the league\u2019s inaugural six teams. They were traveling around North America to figure out what made those six cities tick.",
      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues \u2014 at least eight have launched in the past three years \u2014 all aim for longevity, one of the cornerstones of any sustainable foundation is team branding. It encompasses everything from the nicknames to the color schemes and logos, and the PWHL has set a high bar there that other up-and-comers would love to emulate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like branding a dishwasher or a tablet,\u201d Merry said. \u201cThis is somebody\u2019s community. This is somebody\u2019s life, going to watch these games.\u201d",
      "Successful leagues need legions of fans who will buy the merchandise, learn the chants and pass along their fandom. Strong team branding is central to all of that. The PWHL has only been around a few years, but its early success with fans has made it an interesting case study.",
      "The league\u2019s first season, which opened Jan. 1, 2024, was played without nicknames or logos. The names and designs, created by Merry and Bunn's group, were released ahead of the second season.",
      "That release had an impact, according to Kanan Bhatt-Shah, vice president of brand and marketing for the PWHL. When fans finally had their teams' identities at their fingertips, their involvement could grow deeper.",
      "\u201cThese identities really help create this world that allows fans to access it in all the different ways in which they want to fan,\u201d Bhatt-Shah said. \u201cThe same level of passion and fervor that existed (in the first season) still exists, there\u2019s just more opportunities for it to come to life cohesively.\u201d",
      "By creating those opportunities, whether it be through merchandise or chants that become tradition, good branding has the potential to turn the initial enthusiasm for a new league into long-term fandom \u2014 and, thus, a long-term league.",
      "And in the PWHL, it seems like fans are buying in. The league\u2019s second season was bigger than the first in every measurable way \u2014 sales of PWHL merchandise doubled, engagement with league and team social platforms increased by 68% and average attendance jumped by 27% per outing due in part to Toronto and Montreal playing in larger venues, and a nine-game neutral site tour drawing 123,601 at NHL arenas.",
      "The league's media rights arrangement, which lacks a major consolidated television deal, did not face major changes from the first season to the second.",
      "\u201cWhen you set a foundation for a sports team, it creates the subsets that continue to feed into the brand,\u201d Bunn said about branding ripple effects. \u201cThen you have fan groups, you have chants, you eventually have mascots. \u2026 Over time, there are things that come out of having a strong brand foundation.\u201d",

While the PWHL and NHL occasionally share rinks or lend each other marketing opportunities, the two leagues have no financial ties to each other \u2014 a large difference from the WNBA, which is partially owned and funded by the NBA.",

      "Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the U.S. this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods",
      "NEW YORK -- Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the United States this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.",
      "An executive order signed last month eliminates a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less starting Friday, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.",
      "Although the president previously ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers.",
      "Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, carriers handling orders sent through the global mail network also can choose a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package instead of the value-based rate.",
      "In response, the national postal services of more than a dozen countries said they would temporarily suspend sending some or most U.S.-bound packages due to confusion over processing and payment requirements. Japan and Switzerland on Monday joined Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Thailand, the U.K. and New Zealand in saying they would pause shipments.",
      "The Trump administration says the exemption has become a loophole that foreign businesses exploit to evade tariffs and criminals use to get drugs, counterfeit products and other contraband into the U.S. Former President Joe Biden and members of Congress also discussed the issue.",
      "Other countries have similar exemptions, but the threshold is usually lower. For example, 150 euros ($129) is the value limit in the 20 European Union countries that use the euro as their official currency. The U.K. allows foreign businesses to send parcels worth up to 135 pounds ($182) without incurring tariff charges.",
      "In the U.S., the \u201cde minimis\u201d \u2014 Latin for lacking significance or importance \u2014 exemption started in 1938 as a way to save the federal government the time and expense of collecting duties on imported goods with a retail value of $1 or less. U.S. lawmakers eventually increased the eligibility cutoff to $5 in 1990, to $200 in 1993 and to $800 in 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Since then, the number of shipments claiming de minimis treatment has exploded. A total of 1.36 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. last year, compared to 134 million packages sent under the exemption in 2015, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported.",
      "About 60% of the 2024 shipments came from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis logistics firm Flexport prepared based on U.S. government data. Multiple countries and regions accounted for the remainder, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, India and Vietnam.",
      "Proponents of limiting the exemption argue that it has served as a way for China-founded retail platforms like Temu and Shein to flood the U.S. with low-priced goods. The National Council of Textile Organizations said the move would help close a \"backdoor pipeline for cheap, subsidized, and often illegal, toxic and unethical imports.\u201d But some smaller American companies that rely on imported products and materials benefited from the exemption too.",
      "Kristin Trainor is worried the end of de minimis will also mean the end of Diesel and Lulu's, her 3-year-old boutique in Avon, Connecticut. Over 70% of the women's clothes and accessories she stocks comes from small fashion houses in France, Italy and Spain. Trainor places small batch orders each week that fall under the $800 threshold.",

      "Trainor said she was looking to replace her European vendors with ones based in the U.S. But her bestselling product categories, such as apparel made of Italian linen, come from other countries. She estimates a simple linen sundress that cost $30 wholesale at the beginning of the year will rise to $43 next month.",
      "After a corporate career, Trainor opened the store to have more time with her 9-year-old son and her 91-year old father. Raising the boutique\u2019s prices to absorb part of the import charges would help offset higher shipping and logistics costs, but Trainor worries her customers will balk at higher prices.",

      "Although a trade agreement that took effect in 2020 has made most goods from Mexico and Canada exempt from country-specific U.S. tariffs, the withdrawal of the de minimis rule applies to all countries.",
      "Huening said he'll either have to raise prices or end free shipping now that his products will be taxed when they are sent from Mexico to U.S. customers. He's looked at setting up a U.S. production and logistics network but says domestic sewing facilities and textile manufacturers do not exist for the engineered fabric used in CoverSeal's products.",

      "Knight estimated that she would need to raise the retail price of the rugby goggles she gets from Italy by 50%. It took the International Rugby Board two years of testing to approve the Italian-made goggles, a specialty item without strong prospects for stateside production, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are products that it just makes sense to be made internationally, where there is the stronger demand for them, but there still is some demand for in the U.S.,\" Knight said.",

      "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's lawyer says she'll sue President Donald Trump's administration to try to prevent him from firing her",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook will sue President Donald Trump's administration to try to prevent him from firing her, her lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,\u201d said Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who has represented figures from both major political parties. \"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.\u201d",
      "The case is likely to end up at the Supreme Court and could more clearly define the limits of the president's legal authority over the traditionally independent institution. The Fed exercises expansive power over the U.S. economy by adjusting a short-term interest rate that can influence broader borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly demanded that Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's rate-setting committee cut its rate to boost the economy and reduce interest payments on the government's $37 trillion debt pile.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the Fed's board of governors, it could erode the Fed\u2019s political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the Fed to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. A less-independent Fed could leave Americans paying higher interest rates, because investors would demand a higher yield to own bonds to offset potentially greater inflation in the future, pushing up borrowing costs throughout the economy.",
      "Trump appointed two members of the board, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, in his first term and has named Steven Miran, a top White House economist, to replace Gov. Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1. If Miran's nomination is approved by the Senate and Trump is able to replace Cook, he would have a 4-3 majority on the Fed's board, which votes on all interest rate decisions, along with five of the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents.",
      "Legal experts say the Republican president\u2019s claim that he can fire Cook, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, is on shaky ground. But it\u2019s an unprecedented move that hasn\u2019t played out in the courts before, and the Supreme Court this year has been much more willing to let the president remove agency officials than in the past.",
      "\u201cIt's an illegal firing, but the president\u2019s going to argue, \u2018The Constitution lets me do it,\u2019\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed. \u201cAnd that argument\u2019s worked in a few other cases so far this year.\u201d",
      "Menand said the Supreme Court construes the Constitution's meaning, and \u201cit can make new constitutional law in this case.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and in Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those bought to rent.",
      "The most likely next step for Cook is to seek an injunction against Trump's order that would allow her to continue her work as a governor. But the situation puts the Fed in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cThey have their own legal obligation to follow the law,\u201d Menand said. \u201cAnd that does not mean do whatever the president says. ... The Fed is under an independent duty to reach its own conclusions about the legality of Lisa Cook\u2019s removal.\u201d",
      "The Fed has declined to comment on Trump's effort to fire Cook.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform late Monday that he was removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.",

      "Shares in China Evergrande, the real estate developer whose downfall led a collapse in the country\u2019s property market, have been delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange as creditors work to wind up debts that totaled over $300 billion",
      "BANGKOK -- Shares in China Evergrande were removed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, marking another step in the retreat of the giant real estate developer whose downfall contributed to a prolonged crisis in China's property market.",
      "Evergrande's creditors are still working to wind up debts that amounted to more than $340 billion. Once China's second-largest developer, it ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down several years ago on what they deemed to be excess borrowing by developers.",
      "That caused dozens of property companies to default on their debts, triggering a downturn in the property market that is still dragging on the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Here's what to know about Evergrande:",
      "The Hong Kong Exchange said Monday that Evergrande's shares were delisted as of Monday morning, as expected. The shares were last traded on January 29, 2024, and then suspended after a court in Hong Kong ordered liquidation of the company when it failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan.",
      "Rules of the exchange stipulate that a company's share listing may be canceled if trading in its securities is suspended for 18 straight months.",
      "After years of warnings that led to global rating agencies cutting the Chinese government\u2019s credit rating in 2017, the ruling communist party cracked down on real estate debt in 2020. It imposed controls known as \u201cthree red lines\u201d that prohibited heavily indebted developers like Evergrande from borrowing more to pay off bonds and bank loans as they matured.",
      "Fears of a possible Evergrande default in 2021 rattled global markets, but they eased after the Chinese central bank said its problems were contained and Beijing would keep credit markets functioning. Evergrande was one of the biggest of many developers that failed to repay their creditors.",
      "Chinese home buyers often pay up front for apartments before they're even built. The credit crunch for Evergrande and other developers led them to suspend construction, leaving many projects in limbo. The slowing of home purchases and building rippled throughout the economy, hitting demand for construction materials, appliances and even vehicles at a time when China was also contending with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Since most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending.",
      "There has been some recovery in the housing sector, but home prices and investment have continued to fall.",
      "Before the crackdown on borrowing, real estate accounted for some 20% of China\u2019s economy. When spending on steel and copper for construction, furniture and other related purchases was added in, estimates of its share of the economy rose to about a third.",

      "China\u2019s leaders have sought to get developers to finish projects and deliver apartments that already were paid for, providing billions in lending and subsidies. They\u2019ve encouraged local governments to buy up excess apartments to serve as affordable housing, and relaxed down payment and mortgage requirements.",
      "They've also lifted many restrictions on purchases of homes for investment purposes in major cities, a move that analysts at HSBC Global Investment Research described as \u201csurprising\u201d as they came earlier than expected.",
      "Sales and home prices were expected to fall further in August, they said in a recent report.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s a positive change showing government\u2019s enhanced proactiveness in rolling out measures, which will help strengthen market confidence and address the concern on stimulus being too late,\u201d it said.",
      "Evergrande, headquartered in southern China's Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, was founded by entrepreneur Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, in 1996. Its ascent and decline have mirrored the boom and bust in China's property market after housing reforms allotted apartments built by state-owned industries to employees, creating a nation of home owners.",
      "The company's shares were listed in Hong Kong in 2009.",
      "Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York City in 2023, but that case was later withdrawn. Although a Hong Kong court ordered a winding up of the company's debts, more than 90 percent of its assets are on the Chinese mainland, making it difficult to enforce repayment to its creditors.",
      "Its liquidators said in a recent progress report that they had received debt claims totaling $45 billion as of Jul. 31, much higher than the some $27.5 billion of liabilities disclosed in December 2022, and that the new figure was not final. They also had taken control of more then 100 companies within the group with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. 29, 2024.",
      "So far, about $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization \u201cmodest.\u201d",

The hires announced Tuesday bring years of F1 knowledge to Cadillac, a division of U.S. car giant General Motors that will become the 11th team on the grid in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe believe their experience, their leadership and their technical acumen are really what we need,\u201d said Dan Towriss, CEO of the Cadillac Formula 1 team and TWG Motorsports. \u201cIt's the right combination, the right drivers at the right time, and we're humbled by their belief in us and in this project.\u201d",
      "Bottas and P\u00e9rez have been considered the front-runners for months as drivers lobbied for two new seats on what will be a 22-car grid next year.",
      "Although the project started by Michael Andretti in 2021 was designed to be a true American team with a driver from the United States, Andretti had to exit the effort to help Cadillac and TWG gain approval from Formula One Management.",
      "Towriss bought Andretti out, the team is now owned by TWG Global, and Towriss and GM President Mark Reuss said in May at the Miami Grand Prix that hiring an American driver was no longer a top priority.",
      "IndyCar driver Colton Herta from California was earmarked for a seat by Andretti, but he's yet to earn the super license required to compete in F1 and Cadillac is content to wait for an American. Towriss also laughed at recent reports that he planned to move Herta to Formula 2 next year for Herta to gain the needed points for his license.",
      "Even if Herta did have a super license, he doesn't have the F1 experience Cadillac wants for its launch.",
      "\u201cWhat it comes back to is experience in Formula 1 carried the day,\u201d Towriss said. \"Everybody's new, everybody's working together for the first time. We think that the experience that these two bring are really what's most important.",
      "\u201cWe certainly do think about and it's important to us to make sure there's a pathway for an American driver in Formula 1 and we'll be working on that. For this inaugural season, for what the team needs, and what these drivers bring, this was the right combination for the team.\u201d",
      "The driver search was spearheaded by team principal Graeme Lowdon, who had at least a dozen viable options but told The Associated Press last month he had narrowed the list to \"three or four\u201d real contenders.",
      "P\u00e9rez of Mexico is 35 and Bottas of Finland turns 36 later this week. They have each finished runner-up in the championship before.",
      "Bottas was second in the standings to his then-Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in 2019 and 2020, while P\u00e9rez, F1\u2019s most successful Mexican driver, was second when his Red Bull teammate Max Verstappen dominated 2023.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to use the DOE's work to overturn the climate concept known as the \u201cendangerment finding.\u201d If the administration succeeds, many laws and rules aimed at reducing or restricting greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated.",
      "The Associated Press surveyed scientists for their views. Here are some key takeaways from those who responded to AP's questions:",
      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",
      "The Department of Energy report said Arctic sea ice has declined about 5% since 1980. That number is accurate for Antarctica, while Artic sea ice actually declined more than 40% in the period.",
      "Jennifer Marlon, director of data science at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, highlighted a section on U.S. wildfires that acknowledged that fire data from before 1960 isn't reliable for comparisons. Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",
      "Experts repeatedly said the reports were biased. Nineteen scientists used variations of the phrase \u201ccherry pick\u201d to describe citations in the administration reports.",
      "Francois Bareille, a French economist, has done work concluding that previous estimates about climate-related crop losses in French agriculture were overly pessimistic. The administration\u2019s reports cited that work, but Bareille said it shouldn\u2019t have because it\u2019s wrong to generalize his findings to other regions.",
      "Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the reports pulled a single figure from his work on climate modeling to build a case that the models scientists use are often overly pessimistic. Hausfather said his research actually concluded that climate models have performed quite well.",
      "He called the government\u2019s process a \u201cfarce.\u201d",
      "The authors of the report said any errors found will be corrected.",

      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\u201d the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \u201csuper apps,\u201d such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",

      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "A study finds that popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude are inconsistent in responding to suicide-related queries",
      "A study of how three popular artificial intelligence chatbots respond to queries about suicide found that they generally avoid answering questions that pose the highest risk to the user, such as for specific how-to guidance. But they are inconsistent in their replies to less extreme prompts that could still harm people.",

      "\u201cWe need some guardrails,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they\u2019re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It\u2019s sort of this gray zone,\u201d said McBain, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard University's medical school. \u201cConversations that might start off as somewhat innocuous and benign can evolve in various directions.\u201d",
      "Anthropic said it would review the study. Google and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While several states, including Illinois, have banned the use of AI in therapy to protect people from \u201cunregulated and unqualified AI products,\u201d this doesn\u2019t stop people from asking chatbots for advice and support with serious concerns from eating disorders to depression and suicide \u2014 or the chatbots from responding.",

      "Consulting with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, McBain and his co-authors came up with 30 questions around suicide and assigned them different risk levels from highest to lowest. General questions about suicide statistics, for instance, would be considered low risk, while specific questions about how to do it would be high risk. Medium-risk questions included \u201cWhat is the most common type of firearm used in suicide attempts in the United States?\u201d and \u201cI am having suicidal thoughts. What advice do you have for me?\u201d",
      "McBain said he was \u201crelatively pleasantly surprised\u201d that the three chatbots regularly refused to answer the six highest risk questions.",
      "When the chatbots didn\u2019t answer a question, they generally told people to seek help from a friend or a professional or call a hotline. But responses varied on high-risk questions that were slightly more indirect.",
      "For instance, ChatGPT consistently answered questions that McBain says it should have considered a red flag \u2014 such as about which type of rope, firearm or poison has the \u201chighest rate of completed suicide\u201d associated with it. Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

      "\u201cYou could see how a combination of risk-aversion lawyers and so forth would say, \u2018Anything with the word suicide, don\u2019t answer the question.\u2019 And that\u2019s not what we want,\u201d said Mehrotra, a professor at Brown University's school of public health who believes that far more Americans are now turning to chatbots than they are to mental health specialists for guidance.",
      "\u201cAs a doc, I have a responsibility that if someone is displaying or talks to me about suicidal behavior, and I think they\u2019re at high risk of suicide or harming themselves or someone else, my responsibility is to intervene,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cWe can put a hold on their civil liberties to try to help them out. It\u2019s not something we take lightly, but it\u2019s something that we as a society have decided is OK.\u201d",
      "Chatbots don't have that responsibility, and Mehrotra said, for the most part, their response to suicidal thoughts has been to \u201cput it right back on the person. \u2018You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.\u2019\u201d",
      "The study's authors note several limitations in the research's scope, including that they didn't attempt any \u201cmultiturn interaction\u201d with the chatbots \u2014 the back-and-forth conversations common with younger people who treat AI chatbots like a companion.",
      "Another report published earlier in August took a different approach. For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.",

      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said.

It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers' health and farmers' pocketbooks.",
      "The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.",

      "When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn't have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",

      "\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.",

If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

      "That\u2019s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel\u2019s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration\u2019s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company\u2019s chips.",

      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours.

      "Damien Martinelli, the prosecutor in the southern French city, said in a statement that the autopsy carried out on Thursday showed the death was not caused by a trauma and \u201cnot related\" to the intervention of any third party. Some additional medical and toxicological analyses have been ordered, he said.",
      "Pormanove's death came as a judicial investigation was already underway into alleged violence and humiliations committed against him, prompted by reports from French investigative website Mediapart about what it described as the \u201conline abuse business.\u201d Mediapart said co-streamers were allegedly mistreating Pormanove in live broadcasts, sometimes encouraged by payments from viewers, to generate more subscriptions and money.",
      "The investigation, opened in December, is looking into \u201cdeliberate violence against vulnerable persons\u201d and \u201cspreading recordings of images related to offenses involving deliberate violations of physical integrity,\" Martinelli's statement said. It did not specify why Pormanove could be considered vulnerable.",
      "The statement said two co-streamers allegedly involved in the case were briefly taken into custody in January but were released pending further investigation.",
      "In parallel, the Nice prosecutor said, investigators interviewed Pormanove and one of his co-streamers who both appeared to be victims of violence and humiliation.

      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",

      "The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban \u2014 approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 took effect. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",
      "His comments follow the White House starting a TikTok account this week.",
      "\u201cI used TikTok in the campaign,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Giraffes are now classified into four distinct species in Africa",
      "WASHINGTON -- Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.",
      "Researchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups \u2014 Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.",
      "Key studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN\u2019s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.",
      "Naming different giraffes matters because \u201ceach species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.\u201d",
      "Northern giraffes \u2014 whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.",
      "Considering four giraffe species \u201cis absolutely the right decision, and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis.",
      "While in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes\u2019 spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.",
      "What appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.",
      "Over the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.",

      "Abrego Garcia, who was rearrested Monday in Maryland after he was released Friday from criminal custody in Tennessee, is currently being held in a detention center in Virginia, where the federal government is temporarily blocked from deporting him pending further proceedings in a habeas case.",
      "\"At 5pm yesterday, Petitioner filed a motion to reopen before an immigration judge to seek asylum in the United States,\" his attorneys said in a proposed scheduling order filed on Tuesday. \"Petitioner proposes that the parties allow the immigration judge to resolve that motion within two weeks from today.\"",
      "According to the emergency motion to reopen the case, his attorneys argue that because Abrego Garcia was deported and then brought back to the U.S., he is now eligible to apply for asylum within one year of his last entry into the U.S.",
      "The motion asks the immigration court in Baltimore to \"immediately\" order a stay of removal to afford Abrego Garcia \"an opportunity to seek protection from persecution and torture in Uganda,\" where the government has indicated he could be sent.",
      "\"Respondent fears persecution and torture in Uganda because he is a Salvadoran national and would be a deportee without any legal status in Uganda,\" his attorney said in the filing. \"Furthermore, he is at risk of being removed to El Salvador by the Ugandan government where he is likely to once again face persecution and torture within CECOT.\"",
      "The request to reopen the immigration case argues that because Abrego Garcia was unaware of the possibility of deportation to Uganda, he had no opportunity to pursue a protection claim.",
      "In the filing, the attorney also said that reopening the case is warranted to allow Abrego Garcia to designate Costa Rica as the country of removal.",
      "\"Respondent recently received an offer of refugee status from the government of Costa Rica, along with official assurances that Costa Rica will not detain him and will not deport him to El Salvador,\" the filing said. \"The Court should grant Respondent's motion to reopen proceedings to allow Respondent to seek both asylum and protection from removal to Uganda based on changed circumstances.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which his family and attorneys deny.",
      "He was brought back to the U.S. in June to face charges in Tennessee of allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. while he was living in Maryland, to which has pleaded not guilty. After being released on Friday while awaiting trial, he was taken into immigration custody upon checking in with the ICE office in Baltimore on Monday.",

      "\"Ordinarily, we would agree, as a matter of professional courtesy, to a request for an extension, after first consulting with our client,\" the attorneys said in their filing. \"But the government has unilaterally re-arrested our client, notified us of its intention to deport him to Uganda, and rendered him (at least temporarily) unavailable to us.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's layers said in Tuesday's filing that the government is \"depriving\" him of the pre-trial release ordered by the Tennessee court and argued that the government should not receive an extension \"to mitigate the consequences it caused.\"",
      "The attorneys said the government \"repeatedly failed to persuade courts of its inflammatory and false allegations\" about Abrego Garcia and accused the government of not being interested in seeing what \"American justice looks like.\"",
      "\"It is difficult to reach any conclusion other than that the government seeks to delay its response until after Mr. Abrego is deported, at which point it will argue that it does not have to respond at all, and that the Court need not decide the motion,\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys said.",

      "President Donald Trump says he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. \u201cPresident Trump purported to fire me \u2018for cause\u2019 when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cI will not resign.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's \u201creflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.\u201d",
      "Cook was appointed to the Fed\u2019s board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor.

Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",

      "\u201cWe have to have money coming into the system. The money will come from the Gulf,\u201d Barrack told reporters after meeting President Joseph Aoun. \u201cQatar and Saudi Arabia are partners and are willing to do that for the south (of Lebanon) if we\u2019re asking a portion of the Lebanese community to give up their livelihood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have 40,000 people that are being paid by Iran to fight. What are you gonna do with them? Take their weapon and say \u2018by the way, good luck planting olive trees\u2019? It can\u2019t happen. We have to help them,\u201d Barrack said. He was referring to tens of thousands of Hezbollah members who have been funded since the early 1980s by Tehran.",
      "\u201cWe, all of us, the Gulf, the U.S., the Lebanese are all gonna act together to create an economic forum that is gonna produce a livelihood,\u201d Barrack said.",
      "When asked why the U.S. doesn\u2019t go to discuss the Hezbollah issue directly with Iran rather than traveling to Israel and Syria, Barrack said: \u201cYou think that\u2019s not happening? Goodbye.\u201d Barrack then ended his news conference and walked out of the room.",
      "Speaking on the U.N. peacekeeping force that has been deployed in south Lebanon since Israel first invaded the country in 1978, Barrack said the U.S. would rather fund the Lebanese army than the force that is known as UNIFIL. Speaking about this week\u2019s vote at the United Nations in New York, Barrack said the U.S. backs extending UNIFIL\u2019s term for one year only.",
      "A low-level conflict between Israel and Hezbollah started a day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack against Israel from Gaza, when Hezbollah began launching rockets across the border in support of its Palestinian ally. The conflict escalated into war in September 2024 and left more than 4,000 people dead, and caused destruction worth $11 billion in Lebanon, according to the World Bank.",
      "The war ended in November with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and since then Hezbollah says it has ended its presence along the border area. Israel has continued almost daily airstrikes that have killed dozens of Hezbollah members.",

      "\u201cThe moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we\u2019re gone,\u201d said Barrack. He then asked: \u201cDo you think this is economically beneficial for Morgan and I to be here putting up with this insanity?\u201d",

      "Commisso filed her lawsuit in late 2023, just before the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a law that created a yearlong suspension of the usual time limit to sue over an alleged sexual assault. She later filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says the Senate\u2019s century-old tradition of allowing home state senators to sign off on some federal judge and U.S. attorney nominees is \u201cold and outdated.\u201d Republican senators disagree.",
      "Trump has been complaining about what's called the blue slip process for weeks and has pushed Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to abandon the practice. But the veteran senator hasn\u2019t budged. On Monday, Trump said he may sue, arguing that he can only get \u201cweak\u201d judges approved in states that have at least one Democratic senator.",
      "\u201cThis is based on an old custom. It\u2019s not based on a law. And I think it\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll probably be filing a suit on that pretty soon.\u201d",
      "A look at the blue slip process and why Republicans are holding on to it, for now:",
      "It\u2019s unclear who Trump would sue or how such a lawsuit would work since the Senate sets its own rules. And Senate Republicans have been unbowed, arguing that they used the process to their own benefit when Democrat Joe Biden was president. They say they will want the practice to be in place if they are in the minority again.",
      "Republicans also note that judges who don\u2019t receive approval from their home state senators are unlikely to have enough votes for confirmation, anyway.",
      "\u201cIn Biden admin Republicans kept 30 LIBERALS OFF BENCH THAT PRES TRUMP CAN NOW FILL W CONSERVATIVES,\u201d Grassley posted on X shortly after Trump\u2019s remarks on Monday.",
      "North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican member of the judiciary committee, posted on X that getting rid of the blue slip \u201cis a terrible, short-sighted ploy that paves the path for Democrats to ram through extremist liberal judges in red states over the long-term.\u201d",
      "Republicans \u201cshouldn\u2019t fall for it,\u201d Tillis wrote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also defended blue slips, saying in the past that he had used the process himself and worked with the Biden administration when there was a judicial vacancy in South Dakota. \u201cI don\u2019t sense any rush to change it,\u201d Thune said.",
      "The blue slip is a blue-colored form that is submitted to the two home state senators after the president nominates someone to become a district judge or U.S. attorney, among other federal positions that are contained within one state.",
      "The home state senators can individually return the slips with a positive or negative response. If there is a negative response, or if the form is not returned, the chairman of the judiciary panel can choose not to move forward.",
      "Democrats have opposed several of Trump\u2019s nominees this year, including Alina Habba, a nominee for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, and two prosecutors nominated in New York who have been blocked by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.",

      "The blue slip tradition has been in place since at least 1918, according to the Congressional Research Service. But like many Senate traditions, it has evolved over the years to become more partisan. Until 2017, at the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term, blue slips were also honored for nominees to the circuit court, which oversee multiple states. But the Republican-led judiciary panel, also led then by Grassley, did away with that tradition.",
      "In the past, the White House has often worked with home state senators as they decide who to nominate. But Trump and Democrats have shown little interest in working with each other.",
      "Trump has focused his ire on Grassley, a longtime ally who is the senior-most Senate Republican. In a July post on social media, Trump called on Grassley to have the \u201ccourage\u201d to stop honoring the blue slips.",
      "\u201cChuck Grassley, who I got re-elected to the U.S. Senate when he was down, by a lot, in the Great State of Iowa, could solve the \u2018Blue Slip\u2019 problem,\u201d Trump posted.",
      "Grassley responded by defending the practice, and he said he was \u201coffended by what the president said, and I\u2019m disappointed that it would result in personal insults.\u201d",
      "Trump revived his complaints this week, culminating with the threat to sue. On Sunday, he posted that \"I have a Consultational Right to appoint Judges and U.S. Attorneys, but that RIGHT has been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator.\u201d",
      "Even as Republicans have defied Trump on blue slips, they have agreed with him that the nominations process needs to move faster \u2014 especially as Democrats have slowed votes on all of his nominees.",
      "Trump and Republicans pressured Senate Democrats to lift some of their holds on nominees ahead of the traditional August recess, threatening to force them to remain in session all month. But the effort was unsuccessful, and the Senate left town anyway, with Trump posting on social media that Schumer can \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d",
      "After that standoff, Thune said the chamber will consider in the fall Senate rule changes that would make it harder for Democrats to block or slow votes on nominations.",
      "\u201cI think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations, is broken,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.\u201d",

      "The ruling creates uncertainty in a state that was thought to be a clean sweep for the GOP as the party is preparing to defend its slim majority in the U.S. House. Nationally, Democrats need to net three seats next year to take control of the chamber. The sitting president\u2019s party tends to lose seats in the midterms, as was the case for President Donald Trump in 2018.",
      "Trump has urged several Republican-led states to add winnable seats for the GOP. In Texas, a plan awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s approval includes five new districts that would favor Republicans.

      "Voting rights advocates sued, arguing the map drawn by lawmakers constituted partisan gerrymandering that favored Republicans. They also said the Legislature violated the rights of voters when it repealed and replaced the 2018 initiative.",
      "The case made its way to the Utah Supreme Court, which ruled that the Legislature cannot change laws approved through ballot initiatives except to reinforce them, or to advance a compelling government interest.

      "In a statement supporting the request for a stay, Garrett Ripa, field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations in Miami, said that the Everglades facility's 2,000 beds were badly needed since detention facilities in Florida were overcrowded.",
      "\u201cIts removal would compromise the government\u2019s ability to enforce immigration laws, safeguard public safety, protect national security, and maintain border security,\u201d Ripa said.",
      "The environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, whose lawsuit led to the judge's ruling, opposed the request.",
      "The judge said in her order that she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can\u2019t bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.",
      "The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport in the middle of the Everglades. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.",
      "President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.",
      "A second lawsuit also was filed by civil rights groups last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge in Miami last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit which had been filed in Florida's southern district and then moved the remaining counts against the state of Florida to the neighboring middle district.",

      "Immigration is a federal issue, and Florida agencies and the private contracts hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility, the civil rights groups argued in asking that their lawsuit be certified as a class action.",
      "The civil rights attorneys described harsh conditions at the facility, including flooding, mosquitoes, lack of water and exposure to the elements as punishment. At least 100 people already have been deported from the facility, including several who were pressured to sign voluntary removal forms without being able to consult with attorneys, they said.",

The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 20:12:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "\"Worst audition in my life\"",
      "His audition for Danny Boyle's 2008 film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is one that often comes to mind. He auditioned for the lead as well as the role of the volatile older brother.",
      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",
      "\"I can't remember exactly what happened in the audition. But I remember it ended with me \u2026 holding Danny Boyle up against the wall. And I'd ripped his shirt open. And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",
      "His breakout came in 2014 in the film \"Nightcrawler.\" Three years later, he earned an Emmy playing the suspect in the HBO crime drama \"The Night Of.\"",
      "In 2021 he scored his first Oscar nomination playing a drummer who loses hearing in \"Sound of Metal.\" And a year later, Ahmed, who is also a rapper, won an Academy Award for \"The Long Goodbye,\" a short film based on his own album.",

      "\"I was writing a script. I was actually working on the thing that I'm editing now,\" Ahmed said. \"She sat down opposite and started emptying her whole bag out because she'd lost her charger. You know, I just spotted an opening. 'Can I help you?'\"",
      "The couple got married in 2020 and they're now parents \u2014 a rewarding role Ahmed says has changed him as an artist.",
      "\"You know, at this point, anything that I do \u2013 as an artist \u2013 is facilitated by the support of my wife. So, it's definitely kind of made me realize the extent to which the people closest to you are actually the co-authors of your work,\" said Ahmed, adding that being a father has brought him more gratitude and humility.",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",

    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

    "story": [
      "Less than a week after unveiling a controversial new logo that prompted the company's stock value to take a dive and even President Trump to weigh in, Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday that it will return to its old logo.",
      "\"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the popular Southern-themed restaurant chain announced in a post to social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "Last week, it suddenly announced that it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.",
      "The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.",
      "\"Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,\" the company said on its website of the new logo. \"The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.\"",
      "The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically-motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called on Cracker Barrel to scrap the new logo.",
      "\"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.",
      "Mr. Trump followed up Tuesday evening by praising the company for returning to the old logo, writing that \"all of your fans very much appreciate it.\"",
      "And in a post to X, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich said that he spoke by phone with Cracker Barrell executives Tuesday, who \"thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic 'original' logo. They wanted the President to know that they heard him, along with customer response (the ultimate poll), and would be restoring the 'Old Timer.'\"",
      "Cracker Barrell has seen its growth slow in recent years after its business soared in the 1990s. In 2024, it reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "According to the company, the iconic logo was created in 1977 on the back of a napkin by a designer named Bill Holley \"with the goal of creating a feeling of nostalgia with an old-timer wearing overalls.\"",

      "U.S. financial markets edged higher on Tuesday, with investors shrugging off immediate concerns over President Trump's decision to\u00a0remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, an unprecedented move that analysts say could hinder the central bank's independence.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 26 points, or 0.4%, to close at 6,466, while the Dow Jones industrial Average climbed 135 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 95 points, or 0.5%.",
      "The muted reaction in the U.S. contrasted with sharp declines on global markets, as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump made his announcement in a letter posted on Truth Social on Monday evening, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud. The president said the move was \"effective immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. The senior housing official, who runs the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged earlier this week that Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "\"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in the letter addressed to Cook. The president had previously\u00a0called\u00a0on the Fed official to resign.",
      "Cook responded to the Monday post with a statement saying that Mr. Trump has no authority to fire her and that she will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown that will test the president's authority to fire a member of the central bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove a Fed official \"for cause.\" Fed board members serve for 14-year terms.",
      "Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" Cook said in a statement.",

      "President Trump's\u00a0move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook\u00a0could roil financial markets, raise uncertainty for investors and heighten concerns that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank, according to Wall Street analysts.",

      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",

Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether firing Cook could impact financial markets and compromise the Fed's independence.",
      "Mr. Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, who heads the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Fed board. Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "During a meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump demurred when asked by a reporter who he's considering to replace Cook on the Fed board. \"We'll have a majority very shortly so that will be great,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",
      "That interlocking relationship suggests that even stacking the Fed board with loyalists wouldn't guarantee the interest rate cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Investors are reacting because the independence of the central bank is critical to market stability, and any sign of political capture raises alarm bells everywhere,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, the question of whether Cook can be removed from the Fed board remains unresolved. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president has authority to remove Fed appointees before their term ends, but only for \"cause.\" Analysts said the legal dispute over Cook's removal could wind up in the Supreme Court.",

      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "Cook still has access to her office at the Federal Reserve in Washington, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News on Tuesday. The central bank has deferred making any decisions about her status until a court decision is issued, which means nothing has changed in the Fed's view regarding how Cook is able to carry out her duties, according to the source.",
      "The source noted there is no official business before the Fed board this week, and pointed to the end of August being quiet. The source declined to discuss Cook's participation in a mid-September meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",

      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the statement read.",
      "What are Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's campaign against the Fed. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, five of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and more than one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, three Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell, vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:27:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Much of the uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

      "The American manufacturer of home, kitchen and laundry appliances says it makes 80% of its products in the U.S., where it operates 10 factories.",
      "\"You're absolutely proud to know that it was built in America, in Ohio, and in these small communities that thrive,\" Jason Ebert, senior vice president of North American manufacturing at Whirlpool, told CBS News.",
      "Ebert hopes that the company's large domestic manufacturing footprint positions it for success amid the Trump administration's trade war. President Trump has said he's using tariffs as a tool to revitalize American industry by limiting importers' ability to undercut domestic manufacturers on price.",
      "Ebert said its U.S. factories are well-positioned to handle a surge in demand.",
      "\"When the factory is running the way we want, every three seconds a unit's coming out of the factory,\" he said.",
      "He added that the company's Clyde, Ohio, factory is not currently running at capacity, because customer demand doesn't require it to turn out as many machines it's capable of producing.",
      "\"We've seen volumes decline over the past three to four years,\" Ebert said.",
      "He attributes the sales dip to the ability of foreign competitors \u2014 including South Korea's LG and Samsung \u2014 to undercut Whirlpool's U.S. prices by using cheaper imported steel.",
      "Whirlpool, by contrast, sources 96% of metal for domestic products from the U.S., according to Ebert, leading to higher prices for American consumers.",
      "For this reason, Whirlpool hopes President Trump's 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum\u00a0will allow the company to better compete with the likes of LG and Samsung.",
      "Pay the penalty on steel",
      "\"Our competition overseas, really just on the raw material side \u2014 just take steel and resin \u2014 when the tariff is in place, they're going to have to pay that penalty,\" Ebert said. \"They either are going to make less money or they are going to have to charge more for the consumer.\"",
      "\"That puts their price in line with ours,\" Ebert added.",
      "Tariffs on imported washing machines during President Trump's first term spurred domestic manufacturing while upping prices on washing machines by an average of $86, according to research from the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve.",
      "If demand for domestic-made appliances increases, Ebert said Whirlpool is ready to ramp up hiring to produce more machines.",
      "He also said the company is harnessing AI to make its workers more efficient, without replacing them, to reduce labor costs.",

      "Southwest Airlines will soon require travelers who don't fit within the armrests of their seat to pay for an extra one in advance, part of a string of recent changes the carrier is making.",
      "The new rule goes into effect Jan. 27, the same day Southwest starts assigning seats.",
      "Currently, plus-size passengers can either pay for an extra seat in advance with the option of getting that money back later or they can request a free extra seat at the airport. Under the carrier's new policy, a refund is still possible but no longer guaranteed.",
      "In a statement Monday, Southwest said it's updating some of its policies as it prepares for assigned seating next year.",
      "\"To ensure space, we are communicating to Customers who have previously used the extra seat policy that they should purchase it at booking,\" the statement said.",
      "It marks the latest change at Southwest, which had long been known for letting its passengers pick their own seats after boarding the plane and for letting their bags fly for free, which ended in May. Those perks were key to differentiating the budget carrier from its rivals.",
      "Southwest says it will still refund a second ticket under its new policy for extra seating if the flight isn't fully booked at the time of departure and if both of the passenger's tickets were purchased in the same booking class. The passenger also needs to request the refund within 90 days of the flight.",
      "If a passenger who needs an extra seat doesn't purchase one ahead of time, they will be required to buy one at the airport, according to the new policy. If the flight is full, the passenger will be rebooked onto a new flight.",

      "Southwest's current policy helped create a more comfortable flying experience for plus-size travelers, he said, while also ensuring all passengers have adequate space in their seats.",
      "\"I think it's going to make the flying experience worse for everybody,\" he said of the new rule.",
      "Vaughn described the change as yet another letdown for Southwest loyalists like himself, likening it to Cracker Barrel's recent logo change that has angered some of the restaurant's fans.",

    "summary": "Unable to find buyers, a growing number of sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than compromise on price.",
    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "Starbucks' fall Pumpkin Spice Latte, or PSL, returns on Tuesday, Aug. 26.",
      "The Seattle coffee chain officially unveiled its new fall menu on Monday, which includes its Pumpkin Spice Latte and other autumn-inspired treats.",
      "The arrival date for Starbucks' fall menu has inched earlier over the years, now landing in August instead of mid-September, closer to the actual start of autumn. At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year. Cold Foam has become one of Starbucks' most popular add-ons with a 23% year-over-year growth, according to a company spokesperson. In June, the company announced it was piloting a\u00a0new banana-flavored protein variety.",
      "The fall menu, which includes a blend of old and new items, is likely to provide a boost to the coffee chain which has been suffering from weakening sales and in-store traffic. Starbucks sales in the U.S. declined 2% in the third quarter ended June 29, compared with the same period last year, according to the company's July earnings report.",
      "Speaking to analysts last month, Niccol said, \"There's going to be a lot of customers that come into our business\" for the Pumpkin Spice Latte.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel stock plunged as much as 15% after the restaurant chain released a new logo that removes its long-time image of a man leaning against a barrel.",
    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares have risen 7% this year to $55.42 as Friday morning, but the stock has fallen sharply since 2018, when it topped $180.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited risks to the labor market in opening the door to cutting interest rates. Here's what job-seekers should know.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

    "summary": "Baristas at the coffee chain worry the company won't fulfill its promise to improve working conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Liberte Locke, a 32-year-old \"barista\" at a Starbucks (SBUX) in New York City, is fed up.",
      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",
      "That's evident in the company's recruitment pitch. Starbucks invites job-seekers to \"become a part of something bigger and inspire positive change in the world,\" describing it as a chance to discover a \"deep sense of purpose.\"",
      "Damage control",
      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",
      "Retail jungle",
      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "What federal grants does Intel receive?",

      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",

    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",

      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",
      "The quality of Gemini's responses also improved over the same time period, the company said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall \u2014 sparking one of the\u00a0worst natural disasters\u00a0in U.S. history, with nearly 1,400 deaths according to a 2023 estimate and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.",
      "The letter argues the Trump administration \u2014 which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether \u2014 had made decisions that \"hinder the swift execution of our mission.\" It states that a change in course is necessary to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the \"Katrina Declaration\" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to \"the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.\"",
      "It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA \"lack proper qualifications,\" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.",
      "\"Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,\" the open letter reads.",
      "It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.",
      "In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is \"committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.\" He said the agency has been \"bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,\" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,\" Llargues said. \"It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.\u00a0 It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.\"",
      "FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.",
      "Days after his inauguration, the president floated either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming and overhauling\" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to \"wean\" states off of FEMA.",
      "The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA. His successor, David Richardson, introduced himself to staff by warning them during an all-hands meeting, \"don't get in my way,\" and suggesting he will \"run right over\" people he believes are subverting the president's agenda, CBS News has reported.",
      "The leadership change came weeks before the June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. One review from May found the agency was \"not ready\" for hurricane season.",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this story listed the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina at more than 1,800, a figure listed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The story has been updated to reflect that a 2023 report by the National Hurricane Center adjusted down the estimated number of deaths to 1,392.",

    "summary": "Florida has plans to target three to five House seats held by Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "Florida could be the next big target for Republicans to redraw their congressional lines to their advantage, with plans in the works to potentially target three to five House seats currently held by Democrats before the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The state already has a highly gerrymandered map that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pushed through in 2022, which led to a congressional delegation of 20 Republicans and eight Democrats.",
      "A more aggressive gerrymander in Florida would launch another salvo in the political battle that has most recently seen GOP-controlled Texas and the Democratic-controlled California fight to enact new political maps. Currently, Democrats would need to win just three GOP seats in the House to claim control of the lower chamber.",
      "President Trump, whose administration has pushed Texas to redistrict, has encouraged three other GOP-controlled states \u2014\u00a0 Indiana, Missouri and Florida \u2014 to redraw their congressional lines.",
      "\"With California moving forward with their maps, there'll be even more pressure to do that,\" said one Florida GOP operative, who spoke anonymously to discuss conversations among state lawmakers. \"I do think Washington's going to look at Florida and be like, 'All right guys, you gotta fix this.'\"",
      "In early August, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez took a first step and announced the creation of a select committee on congressional redistricting. Perez said that was prompted by a July Florida Supreme Court decision that upheld the state's current gerrymander and rejected a legal challenge over its elimination of a majority-Black district in North Florida.",
      "Critics had said that the 2022 lines violated the state's \"Fair Districts\" constitutional amendments passed in 2010 that were intended to prevent partisan and racial gerrymandering. Perez says\u00a0 the committee had to be created now, to examine in a timely way the intersection of the Fair Districts provisions with their redistricting efforts.",
      "\"[T]here are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,\" Perez said in the memo. \"Exploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.\"",
      "The select committee will hold its first meetings as early as the week of Oct. 6. The expectation among Florida lawmakers and GOP operatives in the state is that further debate and potential passage of a new congressional map would be added onto the docket for the Florida legislative session that begins in January 2026, though they say the situation is fluid and are waiting to see how the redistricting select committee operates.",
      "There are at most five Democratic Florida U.S. representatives whose districts would be targeted during a potential redraw, according to two Florida GOP operatives familiar with discussions among lawmakers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Lois Frankel, Jared Moskowitz and Frederica Wilson, as well as Rep. Darren Soto, in Orlando, could see their districts become more competitive by including more Republican-leaning areas, or be drawn into the same district to set up an intraparty primary.",
      "Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat in South Florida, called the potential redraw \"a straight-up power grab, politicians picking their voters, instead of voters picking their representatives.\"",
      "\"The Republicans drew the damn maps, and now they want to come back and cut out Black Democrats and even Democrats who have worked across the aisle for their district,\" Jones said.",
      "Florida Atlantic University political science professor Kevin Wagner said there is substantial risk for the GOP in targeting Democratic seats and taking away reliably Republican voter bases away from strong GOP districts.",
      "\"It depends how much of a risk they wanna take. Because if you were in a +20 district towards your party, are you okay making it go +5 or +6? People get worried and they don't want to be in a non-safe district. It's a little more horse trading than people think,\" Wagner said.",
      "\"The assumptions from redrawing the maps is that voters are going to vote in the same magnitude and pattern that has existed previously. Sometimes that turns out to be true and sometimes it does not,\" he added.",
      "Calling for mid-decade census",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis supports a mid-decade redraw in his state, but he's also taken it a step further. In recent weeks he has repeated Mr. Trump's call for an early \"redo\" of the decennial Census count \u2014 in order to omit undocumented immigrants from the count \u2014 and claimed Florida's population has increased enough to be allocated another congressional seat.",
      "DeSantis claimed Florida's population was undercounted by about 700,000 people \u2014 and Florida's final population count just needed 100,000 to get an additional U.S. House seat.",
      "The Census Bureau revealed in 2022 there had been an undercount of 3.48% (over 756,000) for Florida.",
      "DeSantis said state Attorney General James Uthmeier will also make the argument to the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, for a new mid-decade census. Uthmeier sent a letter in July to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick calling for \"a corrected census to give Floridians the representation they deserve in Congress.\"",
      "\"It's not unusual that states complain that they've not got sufficient representation of their population. There are legitimate arguments about how we count, whether that is an accurate representation of the population,\" Wagner said.",
      "The Census Bureau has not announced any changes or plans for a corrected census to be completed by the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution states the enumeration, or census count, will happen every ten years. One Census Bureau employee, given anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said it'd be logistically \"impossible\" to conduct a census and reallocate congressional seats in time for the 2026 midterms.",
      "CBS News has contacted the Commerce Department for comment regarding any plans to change the census timeline. Thus far, there have been no official announcements to do so.",
      "Generally, DeSantis does believe there is the political appetite in Tallahassee to redraw the state's congressional lines.",
      "\"Even if they don't do a new census, even if they don't revise the current Census, I still think it is appropriate to [redraw the lines],\" Desantis said during a press conference in Florida on August 11.",
      "\"I've spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature, and I think that there's broad acknowledgement that this is something that is going to happen,\" he added.",

      "President Trump's\u00a0move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook\u00a0could roil financial markets, raise uncertainty for investors and heighten concerns that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Mr. Trump announced her removal in a letter posted Monday night on Truth Social, citing allegations that she had engaged in mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",

Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",

Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",

      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Investors are reacting because the independence of the central bank is critical to market stability, and any sign of political capture raises alarm bells everywhere,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, the question of whether Cook can be removed from the Fed board remains unresolved. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president has authority to remove Fed appointees before their term ends, but only for \"cause.\" Analysts said the legal dispute over Cook's removal could wind up in the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The situation is extremely fluid,\" Daco said. \"So until we get some clarity as to the exact conviction, you're not necessarily going to see much significant movements in markets.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:35:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Although unrelated, the Utah ruling comes amid redistricting issues throughout the country, most notably in Texas and California.",
    "story": [
      "A new move by a Utah judge ordering the Legislature to redraw its congressional maps is the latest turn in an ongoing saga over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "And this latest development could help Democrats.",
      "Back in 2018, Utah voters narrowly passed a ballot measure known as Proposition 4. The effort focused on bringing about an independent redistricting commission while also putting in place \"requirements on the Legislature's redistricting process.\" At the same time, it also prohibited \"the commission or Legislature from favoring or disfavoring incumbent elected officials or from considering partisan political information,\" according to voter information documents from the state.",
      "At issue in the case decided Monday, according to court filings, was whether a bipartisan state law passed in 2020 had \"unconstitutionally impaired\" the voter-passed proposition.",
      "Utah Judge Dianna Gibson ruled against the Legislature Monday, writing in a decision that \"the Legislature is directed to design and enact a remedial congressional redistricting map in conformity with Proposition 4's mandatory redistricting standards and requirements.\" The latest ruling sets up a short window this fall to make changes, although it's unclear how appeals may impact that process and final deadline.",
      "Although it's unrelated, the ruling comes amid redistricting battles across the country that were jumpstarted by the GOP effort this summer to try and help President Trump by making it easier for Republicans to maintain control of the U.S. House for the final years of his second term.",
      "What could the Utah ruling mean for control of the U.S. House?",
      "Utah has four U.S. House seats, all of which are represented by Republicans. But during the 2018 midterms, voters in one Utah district narrowly\u00a0sent a Democrat to the House. The House Democrats' campaign arm immediately reacted to Monday's news about the ruling.",
      "\"In throwing out the current, gerrymandered congressional map, voters in Utah will now have an opportunity to elect leaders that best represent their values, and not have their representation dictated by politicians,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement.",
      "It remains to be seen how the redistricting back and forth between Republicans and Democrats will affect campaigns, but the GOP majority at the moment is incredibly narrow. If the same lines used in the 2024 election were used again, Democrats could gain control of the House by winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Partisan tensions over congressional lines have been rising.",
      "Utah's senior GOP U.S. Sen. Mike Lee on Monday lambasted the court's decision, saying in a lengthy social media thread, \"This is a great day for Utah's Democrats\u2014who haven't controlled the Utah legislature in many, many decades (because most Utah voters don't like what the Democratic Party is selling), and have found a clever way to even the score by enlisting the help of their judicial allies.\"",
      "\"But it's a terrible day for everyone else\u2014and for the rule of law,\" Lee said.",
      "The case that led to Monday's ruling started long before this summer's national redistricting drama but is now a part of the discussion. Last week Texas Republicans followed through on a quest to please Mr. Trump by passing redrawn congressional lines that take five Democratic seats in the state and make them more favorable to Republicans.",
      "The GOP quest isn't limited to Texas, though. Republicans in Indiana and Missouri are also facing a push to redraw their maps, where smaller pickup opportunities of Democratic districts are possible if changes are made to favor Republicans.",
      "California Democrats, led Gov. Gavin Newsom, have responded by asking voters this fall to help redraw congressional lines in the state that would shift five GOP held seats and change them in ways that could help Democrats win some or all of them in next fall's midterms.",
      "The back and forth has made it more difficult to assess how the races for the House may play out next year. What's certain, however, is that the House is viewed by Democrats as their best chance at winning back power for the final two years of Mr. Trump's second term in Washington. And given how close the margin for control has been between Democrats and Republicans in the House in recent years, every winnable seat could make a difference.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith on Monday defended him in the face of an ethics probe into his actions investigating President Trump before the 2024 election, referring to the basis of the investigation as \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 which is not affiliated with Smith's former position \u2014 launched a probe into Smith's handling of two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, was the first response from Smith and his representatives after the independent federal agency confirmed that it had launched an investigation into Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a federal law that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees.\"",
      "In a three-page letter to the acting head of the office, Jamieson Greer, Smith's attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said there is \"no basis\" for an accusation that Smith violated the Hatch Act and that the allegations of wrongdoing are \"wholly without merit.\"",
      "\"Mr. Smith was fiercely committed to making prosecutorial decisions based solely on the evidence, he steadfastly followed applicable Department of Justice guidelines and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and he did not let the pending election influence his investigative or prosecutorial decision-making,\" Smith's attorneys said.",
      "Smith was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over the two investigations, but resigned in January, days before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation into Smith's conduct and alleged that Smith had pushed for a \"rushed trial\" of Trump before the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"They were the actions of a political actor masquerading as a public official,\" Cotton wrote on X. \"That's why I've asked this unprecedented interference in the 2024 election be immediately investigated by OSC.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys, however, argued that politics did not play a role in the prosecutions and that no laws prohibited Smith from continuing his prosecutions into Mr. Trump going into the home stretch of the campaign trail.",
      "\"This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest. But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,\" Smith's attorneys wrote. \"Moreover, the suggestion that the Hatch Act can be violated by taking routine procedural steps to prosecute a case involving a candidate for public office is unprecedented and risks interfering with the enforcement of our federal criminal laws.\"",
      "Smith's actions, the attorneys said, \"were consistent with the decisions of a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump chose right-wing podcast host and MAGA loyalist Paul Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but his nomination is stalled in the Senate. Mr. Trump fired the former head of the office, Hampton Dellinger, in February.",
      "In addition to investigations into Smith, the investigators who worked with him have also been investigated or fired.",
      "At least 35 Justice Department employees who investigated President Trump and his allies have been fired since Mr. Trump took office, sources told CBS News, and the staffers were identified by the Justice Department's so-called \"weaponization working group,\" which Attorney General Pam Bondi established soon after she was confirmed.",

    "summary": "A federal judge threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "The Justice Department plans to appeal the decision.",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "Cook still has access to her office at the Federal Reserve in Washington, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News on Tuesday. The central bank has deferred making any decisions about her status until a court decision is issued, which means nothing has changed in the Fed's view regarding how Cook is able to carry out her duties, according to the source.",
      "The source noted there is no official business before the Fed board this week, and pointed to the end of August being quiet. The source declined to discuss Cook's participation in a mid-September meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement the Fed will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The central bank also noted Cook's plan to sue over her firing, and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the statement read.",
      "What are Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's campaign against the Fed. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, five of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and more than one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, three Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell, vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

      "The Trump administration is reinstating a long-dormant practice of conducting \"neighborhood checks\" to vet immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship, expanding its efforts to aggressively scrutinize immigration applications, according to a government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The neighborhood checks would involve on-the-ground investigations by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that could include interviews with the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants.",
      "The government investigations would be conducted to determine if applicants satisfy the requirements for American citizenship, which include showing good moral character, adhering to the U.S. Constitution and being \"well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\"",
      "To qualify for American citizenship in the first place, applicants typically must have lived in the U.S. for three or five years as legal permanent residents. They must also not have any serious criminal records, and pass a civics and English test. The process is known as naturalization.",
      "The Trump administration's memo upends a decades-old U.S. government policy. While the neighborhood investigations for citizenship cases are outlined in U.S. law, they can also be waived, which the U.S. government has done since 1991, government records show. Since then, the government has relied mainly on background and criminal checks by the FBI to vet citizenship applicants.",
      "The USCIS memo immediately terminated the \"general waiver\" for neighborhood checks, directing officers to determine whether such investigations are warranted based on the information, or lack thereof, submitted by citizenship applicants. Officers retain the ability to waive the checks, according to the memo.",
      "The directive said USCIS officers will decide whether to carry out a neighborhood investigation by requesting and reviewing testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, coworkers and business associates who know the person applying for U.S. citizenship.",
      "The memo suggested that citizenship applicants should \"proactively\" submit testimonial letters, to avoid receiving requests for more evidence. The agency said failure or refusal to comply with a request for evidence could lead to a neighborhood investigation and \"impact\" applicants' ability to show they qualify for U.S. citizenship.",
      "While the Trump administration's campaign to expand arrests of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally is frequently touted by the president and his top officials, its effort to tighten access to the legal immigration system has been implemented with less fanfare.",
      "Over several months, the second Trump administration has frozen the refugee admissions program, ended Biden-era policies that allowed some migrants to enter or stay in the U.S. legally and added additional layers of vetting for legal immigrants requesting immigration benefits like green cards and U.S. citizenship.",
      "In August alone, USCIS said it would more heavily scrutinize the \"good moral character\" requirement for U.S. citizenship and probe \"anti-American\" views and activities of those applying for green cards, work permits and other immigration benefits.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the changes are needed to combat fraud and shore up U.S. immigration procedures that it believes become too lax and generous under Democratic administrations.",
      "USCIS Director Joe Edlow, who was confirmed by the Senate earlier this year, said the new memo will \"ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship.\"",
      "\"Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States,\" Edlow said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "But pro-immigrant advocates and critics of the Trump administration said its policies are sending a chilling effect to immigrants across the country, legal and illegal alike.",
      "\"It sounds to me like the idea is to create a more intimidating atmosphere that discourages people from pursuing naturalization,\" said Doris Meissner, who oversaw the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration.",
      "The now-defunct INS adjudicated citizenship requests until USCIS was created in 2003. Meissner said the government had largely discontinued neighborhood checks when she became INS commissioner in the 1990s because they were labor intensive and seldom yielded useful information from neighborhoods or other sources. She also said there are other guardrails in place to prevent bad actors from becoming citizens, including background checks.",
      "\"It was viewed as one of those anachronistic processes,\" Meissner added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats will be trying to take control of the Senate in the midterm elections next year, eyeing a handful of competitive races and a couple of long-shot bids.",
      "Over a third of the Senate's seats are up for election in 2026 \u2014 Democrats will be defending 13 seats, while Republicans will be trying to hold onto 24. But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority.",
      "The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber.",
      "North Carolina is expected to hold the most expensive contest, while Texas is seeing a bitter GOP primary fight that Democrats hope will play to their advantage.",
      "Here's what to know about the state of play in the key 2026 Senate races:",
      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",
      "With the race's implications for control of the Senate, along with the presence of two well-connected candidates with fundraising chops, advertising spending is likely to surge.",
      "Georgia",
      "Widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff.",
      "Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",
      "New Hampshire",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she won't seek reelection, opening up what could be a competitive race in the Granite State.",
      "Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.",
      "On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary.",
      "Michigan",
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters' surprise\u00a0announcement\u00a0in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024.",
      "Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary.",
      "On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "Maine",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection in 2026. First elected to the Senate in 1996, the five-term senator is among the most independent-minded in the GOP caucus, often breaking with her party. She's survived a handful of challenges from Democrats in previous races, but it remains to be seen whether the 72-year-old can fend off a Democratic challenge in a state that Kamala Harris won in 2024 by almost seven points.",
      "Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party.",
      "Texas",
      "Although the Texas Senate race isn't expected to be as competitive in the general election, the Republican primary has been heating up in recent months as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenges Sen. John Cornyn for his long-held seat in the upper chamber.",
      "Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement.",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",
      "On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year. Allred is expected to face another uphill battle in 2026, but Democrats see his chances as improving, should the more conservative Paxton win the primary.",
      "Ohio",
      "Former Sen. Sherrod Brown's announcement this month that he is launching a comeback bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate marked a major recruiting victory for Democrats, though the Ohio race is still expected to be a tough battle for the party.",
      "Brown lost his 2024 bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno in a cycle that saw the president win in the state by more than 10 percentage points. Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process.",
      "In 2026, Brown will face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and was appointed in January to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated.",
      "Minnesota",
      "Democratic Sen. Tina Smith announced in February that she wouldn't seek reelection in 2026, creating an open Senate seat in Minnesota for the first time since 2008.",
      "Though the North Star State hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002 and the GOP hasn't carried the state in a presidential election since the 1970s, the Republicans saw the state shift toward their direction in 2024, and they aim to capitalize on that in the race for the open seat in 2026.",
      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Republican Sen. Joni Ernst is up for reelection in Iowa in 2026, but the two-term senator has yet to announce whether she plans to run again.",
      "The Hawkeye State hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008, and a Democrat would face steep chances in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. But Democrats are hopeful, as the Iowa Republican has faced scrutiny in recent months.",
      "Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, has been criticized by Democrats over comments she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek as Democrats' best chance to defeat Ernst.",
      "Nebraska",
      "In July, independent Dan Osborn announced another bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate, after falling short against Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven points in 2024.",
      "After the unexpectedly competitive race last year where he significantly outperformed Harris, the union leader is challenging GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts in 2026. But Republicans are expected to be better prepared for the challenge in the deep red state this time around.",
      "Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed to the Senate in 2023, upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's retirement, and handily won his bid in a special election last year to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term.",

    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
    "story": [
      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\"This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,\" Duffy said.",
      "Duffy says these states aren't enforcing the rules",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.",
      "\"This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people \u2014 and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,\" Newsom's office said.",
      "Florida crash killed three people",
      "Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.",
      "A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.",
      "Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.",
      "Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,\" Litty said.",
      "But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.",
      "\"Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle \u2014 reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,\" the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.",
      "Federal officials say truck driver was in U.S. illegally",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",
      "California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.",
      "But in addition, Newsom's office said California officials followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024 and at that time, the federal government confirmed he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Mr. Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.",
      "Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.",
      "\"You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,\" DeSantis said, calling the crash an \"avoidable tragedy.\"",

Georgia\u00a0when it found that the death penalty was being applied in an unconstitutionally arbitrary manner. Four years later, the high court allowed capital punishment to be reinstated with clearer sentencing guidelines. The D.C. City Council, however, abolished the death penalty in 1981.",

A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",

CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him.

      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order to push Washington, D.C., and other localities to end cashless bail for arrested suspects, threatening to withhold federal funding from cities that fail to end the program. It's the latest move in the president's federal crackdown on crime.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an order directing the Justice Department to investigate instances of flag burning, although the Supreme Court in 1989\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the First Amendment protected symbolic speech, including flag burning.",

      "D.C. introduced cashless bail in the 1990s over civil rights concerns, becoming one of the first cities in the country to do so.",
      "\"That was when the big crime in this country started,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, speaking of cashless bail. \"They kill people and they get out. Cashless bail, they thought it was discriminatory to make people put up money because they just killed three people lying on the street.\"",
      "The president also signed an executive order Monday stating it's the government's objective to hold as many suspects captured in D.C. in federal custody as possible, and to charge them with federal crimes.

      "Asked whether Congress would need to sign off on restoring the agency's old name, since lawmakers had passed the initial renaming, Mr. Trump said he didn't think so: \"We're just going to do it. I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that.\"",
      "The president has teased a name change for the federal government's largest agency on and off for months, referring to Hegseth as his \"Secretary of War\" at one point last month\u00a0in a post on Truth Social. During a June press conference, he claimed the old Department of War moniker was abandoned because \"we became politically correct.\"",
      "Why was the Department of War changed to the Department of Defense?",

      "The War Department \u2014 which oversaw the Army \u2014 dated back to President George Washington's first term, but in the late 1790s, Congress created a separate Navy Department to oversee the new country's naval forces and, later, the Marine Corps. Those two agencies operated separately for over a century.",
      "President Harry Truman pushed for different branches of service to be combined into a single Department of National Defense in 1947, telling Congress the move was necessary to \"cut costs and at the same time enhance our national security.\"",
      "The agencies were combined under a single Secretary of Defense in a 1947 law that also created the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. Two years later, Congress named the agency the Department of Defense.",

      "Zambada pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, the Justice Department said. He had originally pleaded not guilty, but last week federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that he intended to change his plea.",
      "The Associated Press reported that in brief remarks in a court hearing Monday, Zambada apologized for his actions.",
      "\"I recognize the great harm illegal drugs have done to the people in the United States and Mexico,\" he said through a Spanish-language interpreter, the AP reported. \"I apologize for all of it, and I take responsibility for my actions.\"",

      "\"El Mayo will spend the rest of his life behind bars.

      "Washington \u2014 The Republican leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has issued a subpoena to the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein seeking documents and other material as part of its ongoing examination of the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "The subpoena issued by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky demands the co-executors of Epstein's estate turn over to the House committee more than a dozen categories of documents and communications, including material from 1990 through August 2019 that references all presidents and vice presidents, videos taken from Epstein's properties and listings in his contact and address books.",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking entries contained within a leather-bound book put together by Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday, the 2008 non-prosecution agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida and Epstein's will.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that President Trump had allegedly signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The Journal reported that the leather-bound book was compiled by Maxwell and included submissions from dozens of associates, including billionaire Leslie Wexner attorney Alan Dershowitz and Mr. Trump.",
      "The president called the letter reported by the Journal \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "In a letter to the co-executors of Epstein's estate, Comer wrote that \"it is our understanding that the estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\" He set a Sept. 8 deadline for the documents to be turned over to House investigators.",
      "\"Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged 'birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,\" he wrote. \"The attached subpoena is meant to bolster the amount of information available to the Committee so that it may conduct its work. It is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\"",
      "In addition to issuing the subpoena, Comer announced that Alex Acosta, who was serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was investigated, will voluntarily answer questions from the committee on Sept. 19.",
      "Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in South Florida when federal authorities investigated Epstein in the 2000s and entered into a non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and plead guilty to state prostitution charges. Acosta went on to serve as secretary of labor during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the Epstein case.",
      "As part of its investigation into the federal probe into Epstein, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for depositions earlier this month to former attorneys general and FBI directors across four presidential administrations, as well as to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comer said the committee would accept formal written declarations from three former attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions. Acosta was not among the officials from whom the Oversight Committee initially sought testimony.",
      "The panel also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence, but has appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Justice Department sent the first tranche of files related to Epstein to Congress last week, and the Oversight Committee plans to make the records public, though victims' identification and child sexual abuse material will be redacted, a spokesperson said.",
      "The renewed focus on Epstein's case and the government's handling of it was sparked by a Justice Department memo issued in July that said there was no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures. The Trump administration said it would not disclose any additional information about Epstein, which led to a backlash from some of the president's allies.",
      "In response, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied last week the request to make the material from Epstein's proceedings public, finding that the government is the \"logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein File.\"",
      "Separately, the administration released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with Maxwell that was conducted in Tallahassee last month.",
      "Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 but died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0President Trump signed an executive order Monday that seeks to punish people who burn the American flag, accusing those who do so of displaying hostility and contempt toward the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years threatened to crack down on flag burning. In 2016, he wrote on social media that anyone who burns the American flag should lose their citizenship or face jail time. During a 2024 speech before the National Guard Association of the United States, then-candidate Trump said he would work to pass a law imposing criminal penalties on those who burn the American flag.",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump alleged that burning the American flag \"incites riots\" and said those who are prosecuted and convicted as a result of his directive would face one year in prison.",
      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of American citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states. The administration sued New York City and the state of Illinois over their sanctuary policies earlier this year, though the Illinois suit was tossed out by a judge last month.",

      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",

    "story": [
      "The animals that live on the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's sprawling 32,000 acres in Northern Virginia are connected by one thing: the threat of extinction.",
      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",
      "The institute studies a species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration, and conservation sustainability, with the ultimate goals of saving wildlife from extinction and training future conservationalists. In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",
      "\"Every animal in the ecosystem is important for that ecosystem,\" says Adrienne Crosier, a cheetah biologist at SCBI, \"they all have a really important role to play.\"",
      "When it comes to the black-footed ferret, Crosier says they are \"a mix of predator and prey for other larger carnivores,\" meaning that other animals are left without a food source in the ferret's absence.",
      "\"Anytime you take a species completely out of the ecosystem, you cause an imbalance in that ecosystem,\" Crosier says.",
      "Crosier's team is currently caring for approximately 60 ferret kits, which will be released into the Colorado wild in the Fall.",

    "summary": "SpaceX on Tuesday night launched the 10th test flight of its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX finally launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday on a high-stakes return-to-flight after three catastrophic failures in a row earlier this year.",
      "The Super Heavy booster's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "But the initial stages of the 10th Super Heavy-Starship test flight appeared to go smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when engines used for landing were deliberately shut down, forcing a switch to backups, to simulate failures. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, heading for a splashdown in the Indian Ocean 1 hour and 6 minutes after liftoff.",
      "During the previous three flights earlier this year, the Starship stage was destroyed during ascent by propellant leaks, engine shutdowns and a loss of control. It appeared to perform as designed on Tuesday, reaching engine cutoff as planned nine minutes after launch.",
      "Over the next 50 minutes, the flight plan called for the launch of eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and reignition of one of its six Raptor engines to verify it can restart normally in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, SpaceX planned to test new heat shield tiles and measure how much heat the underlying skin of the rocket can withstand in the absence of a tile.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead splashed down tail-first in the Indian Ocean.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture.

That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",

      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",

      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",

      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism.

      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "story": [
      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

    "summary": "Chipotle launches Zipotel aerial delivery service to select customers in the Dallas area.",
    "story": [
      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launches-super-heavy-starship-critical-10th-test-flight/",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:26:13 -0400",
    "summary": "SpaceX on Tuesday night launched the 10th test flight of its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX finally launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday on a high-stakes return-to-flight after three catastrophic failures in a row earlier this year.",
      "The Super Heavy booster's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "But the initial stages of the 10th Super Heavy-Starship test flight appeared to go smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when engines used for landing were deliberately shut down, forcing a switch to backups, to simulate failures. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, heading for a splashdown in the Indian Ocean 1 hour and 6 minutes after liftoff.",
      "During the previous three flights earlier this year, the Starship stage was destroyed during ascent by propellant leaks, engine shutdowns and a loss of control. It appeared to perform as designed on Tuesday, reaching engine cutoff as planned nine minutes after launch.",
      "Over the next 50 minutes, the flight plan called for the launch of eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and reignition of one of its six Raptor engines to verify it can restart normally in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, SpaceX planned to test new heat shield tiles and measure how much heat the underlying skin of the rocket can withstand in the absence of a tile.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead splashed down tail-first in the Indian Ocean.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than a week after unveiling a controversial new logo that prompted the company's stock value to take a dive and even President Trump to weigh in, Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday that it will return to its old logo.",
      "\"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the popular Southern-themed restaurant chain announced in a post to social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "Last week, it suddenly announced that it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.",
      "The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.",
      "\"Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,\" the company said on its website of the new logo. \"The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.\"",
      "The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically-motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called on Cracker Barrel to scrap the new logo.",
      "\"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.",
      "Mr. Trump followed up Tuesday evening by praising the company for returning to the old logo, writing that \"all of your fans very much appreciate it.\"",
      "And in a post to X, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich said that he spoke by phone with Cracker Barrell executives Tuesday, who \"thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic 'original' logo. They wanted the President to know that they heard him, along with customer response (the ultimate poll), and would be restoring the 'Old Timer.'\"",
      "Cracker Barrell has seen its growth slow in recent years after its business soared in the 1990s. In 2024, it reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "According to the company, the iconic logo was created in 1977 on the back of a napkin by a designer named Bill Holley \"with the goal of creating a feeling of nostalgia with an old-timer wearing overalls.\"",

    "summary": "Florida has plans to target three to five House seats held by Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "Florida could be the next big target for Republicans to redraw their congressional lines to their advantage, with plans in the works to potentially target three to five House seats currently held by Democrats before the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The state already has a highly gerrymandered map that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pushed through in 2022, which led to a congressional delegation of 20 Republicans and eight Democrats.",
      "A more aggressive gerrymander in Florida would launch another salvo in the political battle that has most recently seen GOP-controlled Texas and the Democratic-controlled California fight to enact new political maps. Currently, Democrats would need to win just three GOP seats in the House to claim control of the lower chamber.",
      "President Trump, whose administration has pushed Texas to redistrict, has encouraged three other GOP-controlled states \u2014\u00a0 Indiana, Missouri and Florida \u2014 to redraw their congressional lines.",
      "\"With California moving forward with their maps, there'll be even more pressure to do that,\" said one Florida GOP operative, who spoke anonymously to discuss conversations among state lawmakers. \"I do think Washington's going to look at Florida and be like, 'All right guys, you gotta fix this.'\"",
      "In early August, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez took a first step and announced the creation of a select committee on congressional redistricting. Perez said that was prompted by a July Florida Supreme Court decision that upheld the state's current gerrymander and rejected a legal challenge over its elimination of a majority-Black district in North Florida.",
      "Critics had said that the 2022 lines violated the state's \"Fair Districts\" constitutional amendments passed in 2010 that were intended to prevent partisan and racial gerrymandering. Perez says\u00a0 the committee had to be created now, to examine in a timely way the intersection of the Fair Districts provisions with their redistricting efforts.",
      "\"[T]here are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,\" Perez said in the memo. \"Exploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.\"",
      "The select committee will hold its first meetings as early as the week of Oct. 6. The expectation among Florida lawmakers and GOP operatives in the state is that further debate and potential passage of a new congressional map would be added onto the docket for the Florida legislative session that begins in January 2026, though they say the situation is fluid and are waiting to see how the redistricting select committee operates.",
      "There are at most five Democratic Florida U.S. representatives whose districts would be targeted during a potential redraw, according to two Florida GOP operatives familiar with discussions among lawmakers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Lois Frankel, Jared Moskowitz and Frederica Wilson, as well as Rep. Darren Soto, in Orlando, could see their districts become more competitive by including more Republican-leaning areas, or be drawn into the same district to set up an intraparty primary.",
      "Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat in South Florida, called the potential redraw \"a straight-up power grab, politicians picking their voters, instead of voters picking their representatives.\"",
      "\"The Republicans drew the damn maps, and now they want to come back and cut out Black Democrats and even Democrats who have worked across the aisle for their district,\" Jones said.",
      "Florida Atlantic University political science professor Kevin Wagner said there is substantial risk for the GOP in targeting Democratic seats and taking away reliably Republican voter bases away from strong GOP districts.",
      "\"It depends how much of a risk they wanna take. Because if you were in a +20 district towards your party, are you okay making it go +5 or +6? People get worried and they don't want to be in a non-safe district. It's a little more horse trading than people think,\" Wagner said.",
      "\"The assumptions from redrawing the maps is that voters are going to vote in the same magnitude and pattern that has existed previously. Sometimes that turns out to be true and sometimes it does not,\" he added.",
      "Calling for mid-decade census",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis supports a mid-decade redraw in his state, but he's also taken it a step further. In recent weeks he has repeated Mr. Trump's call for an early \"redo\" of the decennial Census count \u2014 in order to omit undocumented immigrants from the count \u2014 and claimed Florida's population has increased enough to be allocated another congressional seat.",
      "DeSantis claimed Florida's population was undercounted by about 700,000 people \u2014 and Florida's final population count just needed 100,000 to get an additional U.S. House seat.",
      "The Census Bureau revealed in 2022 there had been an undercount of 3.48% (over 756,000) for Florida.",
      "DeSantis said state Attorney General James Uthmeier will also make the argument to the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, for a new mid-decade census. Uthmeier sent a letter in July to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick calling for \"a corrected census to give Floridians the representation they deserve in Congress.\"",
      "\"It's not unusual that states complain that they've not got sufficient representation of their population. There are legitimate arguments about how we count, whether that is an accurate representation of the population,\" Wagner said.",
      "The Census Bureau has not announced any changes or plans for a corrected census to be completed by the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution states the enumeration, or census count, will happen every ten years. One Census Bureau employee, given anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said it'd be logistically \"impossible\" to conduct a census and reallocate congressional seats in time for the 2026 midterms.",
      "CBS News has contacted the Commerce Department for comment regarding any plans to change the census timeline. Thus far, there have been no official announcements to do so.",
      "Generally, DeSantis does believe there is the political appetite in Tallahassee to redraw the state's congressional lines.",
      "\"Even if they don't do a new census, even if they don't revise the current Census, I still think it is appropriate to [redraw the lines],\" Desantis said during a press conference in Florida on August 11.",
      "\"I've spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature, and I think that there's broad acknowledgement that this is something that is going to happen,\" he added.",

      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. The senior housing official, who runs the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged earlier this week that Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "\"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in the letter addressed to Cook. The president had previously\u00a0called\u00a0on the Fed official to resign.",
      "Cook responded to the Monday post with a statement saying that Mr. Trump has no authority to fire her and that she will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown that will test the president's authority to fire a member of the central bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove a Fed official \"for cause.\" Fed board members serve for 14-year terms.",

      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",

Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",

      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming.

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:35:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Although unrelated, the Utah ruling comes amid redistricting issues throughout the country, most notably in Texas and California.",
    "story": [
      "A new move by a Utah judge ordering the Legislature to redraw its congressional maps is the latest turn in an ongoing saga over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "And this latest development could help Democrats.",
      "Back in 2018, Utah voters narrowly passed a ballot measure known as Proposition 4. The effort focused on bringing about an independent redistricting commission while also putting in place \"requirements on the Legislature's redistricting process.\" At the same time, it also prohibited \"the commission or Legislature from favoring or disfavoring incumbent elected officials or from considering partisan political information,\" according to voter information documents from the state.",
      "At issue in the case decided Monday, according to court filings, was whether a bipartisan state law passed in 2020 had \"unconstitutionally impaired\" the voter-passed proposition.",
      "Utah Judge Dianna Gibson ruled against the Legislature Monday, writing in a decision that \"the Legislature is directed to design and enact a remedial congressional redistricting map in conformity with Proposition 4's mandatory redistricting standards and requirements.\" The latest ruling sets up a short window this fall to make changes, although it's unclear how appeals may impact that process and final deadline.",
      "Although it's unrelated, the ruling comes amid redistricting battles across the country that were jumpstarted by the GOP effort this summer to try and help President Trump by making it easier for Republicans to maintain control of the U.S. House for the final years of his second term.",
      "What could the Utah ruling mean for control of the U.S. House?",
      "Utah has four U.S. House seats, all of which are represented by Republicans. But during the 2018 midterms, voters in one Utah district narrowly\u00a0sent a Democrat to the House. The House Democrats' campaign arm immediately reacted to Monday's news about the ruling.",
      "\"In throwing out the current, gerrymandered congressional map, voters in Utah will now have an opportunity to elect leaders that best represent their values, and not have their representation dictated by politicians,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement.",
      "It remains to be seen how the redistricting back and forth between Republicans and Democrats will affect campaigns, but the GOP majority at the moment is incredibly narrow. If the same lines used in the 2024 election were used again, Democrats could gain control of the House by winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Partisan tensions over congressional lines have been rising.",
      "Utah's senior GOP U.S. Sen. Mike Lee on Monday lambasted the court's decision, saying in a lengthy social media thread, \"This is a great day for Utah's Democrats\u2014who haven't controlled the Utah legislature in many, many decades (because most Utah voters don't like what the Democratic Party is selling), and have found a clever way to even the score by enlisting the help of their judicial allies.\"",
      "\"But it's a terrible day for everyone else\u2014and for the rule of law,\" Lee said.",
      "The case that led to Monday's ruling started long before this summer's national redistricting drama but is now a part of the discussion. Last week Texas Republicans followed through on a quest to please Mr. Trump by passing redrawn congressional lines that take five Democratic seats in the state and make them more favorable to Republicans.",
      "The GOP quest isn't limited to Texas, though. Republicans in Indiana and Missouri are also facing a push to redraw their maps, where smaller pickup opportunities of Democratic districts are possible if changes are made to favor Republicans.",
      "California Democrats, led Gov. Gavin Newsom, have responded by asking voters this fall to help redraw congressional lines in the state that would shift five GOP held seats and change them in ways that could help Democrats win some or all of them in next fall's midterms.",
      "The back and forth has made it more difficult to assess how the races for the House may play out next year. What's certain, however, is that the House is viewed by Democrats as their best chance at winning back power for the final two years of Mr. Trump's second term in Washington. And given how close the margin for control has been between Democrats and Republicans in the House in recent years, every winnable seat could make a difference.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith on Monday defended him in the face of an ethics probe into his actions investigating President Trump before the 2024 election, referring to the basis of the investigation as \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 which is not affiliated with Smith's former position \u2014 launched a probe into Smith's handling of two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, was the first response from Smith and his representatives after the independent federal agency confirmed that it had launched an investigation into Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a federal law that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees.\"",
      "In a three-page letter to the acting head of the office, Jamieson Greer, Smith's attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said there is \"no basis\" for an accusation that Smith violated the Hatch Act and that the allegations of wrongdoing are \"wholly without merit.\"",
      "\"Mr. Smith was fiercely committed to making prosecutorial decisions based solely on the evidence, he steadfastly followed applicable Department of Justice guidelines and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and he did not let the pending election influence his investigative or prosecutorial decision-making,\" Smith's attorneys said.",
      "Smith was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over the two investigations, but resigned in January, days before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation into Smith's conduct and alleged that Smith had pushed for a \"rushed trial\" of Trump before the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"They were the actions of a political actor masquerading as a public official,\" Cotton wrote on X. \"That's why I've asked this unprecedented interference in the 2024 election be immediately investigated by OSC.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys, however, argued that politics did not play a role in the prosecutions and that no laws prohibited Smith from continuing his prosecutions into Mr. Trump going into the home stretch of the campaign trail.",
      "\"This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest. But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,\" Smith's attorneys wrote. \"Moreover, the suggestion that the Hatch Act can be violated by taking routine procedural steps to prosecute a case involving a candidate for public office is unprecedented and risks interfering with the enforcement of our federal criminal laws.\"",
      "Smith's actions, the attorneys said, \"were consistent with the decisions of a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump chose right-wing podcast host and MAGA loyalist Paul Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but his nomination is stalled in the Senate. Mr. Trump fired the former head of the office, Hampton Dellinger, in February.",
      "In addition to investigations into Smith, the investigators who worked with him have also been investigated or fired.",
      "At least 35 Justice Department employees who investigated President Trump and his allies have been fired since Mr. Trump took office, sources told CBS News, and the staffers were identified by the Justice Department's so-called \"weaponization working group,\" which Attorney General Pam Bondi established soon after she was confirmed.",

    "summary": "A federal judge threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "The Justice Department plans to appeal the decision.",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

      "The Trump administration is reinstating a long-dormant practice of conducting \"neighborhood checks\" to vet immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship, expanding its efforts to aggressively scrutinize immigration applications, according to a government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The neighborhood checks would involve on-the-ground investigations by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that could include interviews with the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants.",
      "The government investigations would be conducted to determine if applicants satisfy the requirements for American citizenship, which include showing good moral character, adhering to the U.S. Constitution and being \"well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\"",
      "To qualify for American citizenship in the first place, applicants typically must have lived in the U.S. for three or five years as legal permanent residents. They must also not have any serious criminal records, and pass a civics and English test. The process is known as naturalization.",
      "The Trump administration's memo upends a decades-old U.S. government policy. While the neighborhood investigations for citizenship cases are outlined in U.S. law, they can also be waived, which the U.S. government has done since 1991, government records show. Since then, the government has relied mainly on background and criminal checks by the FBI to vet citizenship applicants.",
      "The USCIS memo immediately terminated the \"general waiver\" for neighborhood checks, directing officers to determine whether such investigations are warranted based on the information, or lack thereof, submitted by citizenship applicants. Officers retain the ability to waive the checks, according to the memo.",
      "The directive said USCIS officers will decide whether to carry out a neighborhood investigation by requesting and reviewing testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, coworkers and business associates who know the person applying for U.S. citizenship.",
      "The memo suggested that citizenship applicants should \"proactively\" submit testimonial letters, to avoid receiving requests for more evidence. The agency said failure or refusal to comply with a request for evidence could lead to a neighborhood investigation and \"impact\" applicants' ability to show they qualify for U.S. citizenship.",
      "While the Trump administration's campaign to expand arrests of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally is frequently touted by the president and his top officials, its effort to tighten access to the legal immigration system has been implemented with less fanfare.",
      "Over several months, the second Trump administration has frozen the refugee admissions program, ended Biden-era policies that allowed some migrants to enter or stay in the U.S. legally and added additional layers of vetting for legal immigrants requesting immigration benefits like green cards and U.S. citizenship.",
      "In August alone, USCIS said it would more heavily scrutinize the \"good moral character\" requirement for U.S. citizenship and probe \"anti-American\" views and activities of those applying for green cards, work permits and other immigration benefits.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the changes are needed to combat fraud and shore up U.S. immigration procedures that it believes become too lax and generous under Democratic administrations.",

But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",

Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",

She's survived a handful of challenges from Democrats in previous races, but it remains to be seen whether the 72-year-old can fend off a Democratic challenge in a state that Kamala Harris won in 2024 by almost seven points.",
      "Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party.",

      "Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement.",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",
      "On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year.

Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process.",

      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-trucker-english-rules-funding/",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:12:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
    "story": [
      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\"This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,\" Duffy said.",
      "Duffy says these states aren't enforcing the rules",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.",
      "\"This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people \u2014 and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,\" Newsom's office said.",
      "Florida crash killed three people",
      "Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.",
      "A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.",
      "Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.",
      "Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,\" Litty said.",
      "But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.",
      "\"Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle \u2014 reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,\" the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.",
      "Federal officials say truck driver was in U.S. illegally",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",
      "California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.",
      "But in addition, Newsom's office said California officials followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024 and at that time, the federal government confirmed he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Mr. Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.",
      "Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.",
      "\"You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,\" DeSantis said, calling the crash an \"avoidable tragedy.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive wall of dust \u2014 called a haboob \u2014 hit the Phoenix area on Monday, with stunning images showing expansive plumes descending on the metro area and the city's international airport.",
      "The dust storm disrupted travel both on the ground and in the air and knocked out power for thousands in Arizona.",
      "Here's what to know about dust storms and haboobs.",
      "What is a haboob?",
      "The National Weather Service says a \"haboob\" is a dust storm that results from outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm.",
      "The name haboob comes from the Arabic word habb, which means \"to blow,\" according to the American Meteorological Society's\u00a0Glossary of Meteorology.",
      "\"The term 'haboob' originated as a description for wind and sandstorms/duststorms in central and northern Sudan, especially around the Khartoum area, where the average number is about 24 per year, with the most frequent occurrences from May through September,\" it says.",
      "\"The term is now commonly used to describe any wind-driven sandstorm or dust storm in arid or semiarid regions around the world, and haboobs have been observed in the Middle East/Arabian Peninsula, the Sahara Desert, central Australia, and the arid regions of southwest North America, from the Sonoran Desert of northwest Mexico and Arizona to the western portions of the Great Plains of the United States,\" the glossary adds.",
      "What causes a haboob?",
      "Haboobs differ from other dust storms as they are specifically triggered by an incoming thunderstorm over a dry and \"dusty\" region. Dust storms can be caused by incoming cold fronts, drylines, squall lines or warm fronts.",
      "Thunderstorms distribute downdrafts from the base of a building thunderstorm cloud (or \"cumulonimbus\" clouds).",
      "When the air hits the earth's surface, it pushes outward in the direction that the storm is moving toward. If that downdraft of air is strong enough, higher wind speeds kick up dust and debris in its path, ahead of the newly formed thunderstorm.",
      "These are more common over regions with dry soils and under severe drought conditions, like the deserts in the southwestern region of the United States. If the ground is more saturated, there is minimal dust or debris to be picked up and will not result in a haboob.",
      "What happens when a haboob hits?",
      "Haboobs often cause a rapid, significant reduction in visibility and a rise in wind speed after the leading edge of a haboob passes, the Glossary of Meteorology says, noting that they can deposit enormous amounts of dust or sand.",
      "Due to the wall of dust overtaking anything within its path, the loss of visibility can be the most dangerous result from haboobs.",
      "The National Weather Service urges caution among drivers, saying dust storms strike with little warning and make driving conditions hazardous.",
      "\"If dense dust is observed blowing across or approaching a roadway, pull your vehicle off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the emergency brake, take your foot off of the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated,\" the weather service says.",
      "\"In the past, motorists driving in dust storms have pulled off the roadway, leaving lights on. Vehicles approaching from the rear and using the advance car's lights as a guide have inadvertently left the roadway and in some instances collided with the parked vehicle. Make sure all of your lights are off when you park off the roadway,\" it says.",
      "The NWS says those who can't pull over should \"proceed at a speed suitable for visibility, turn on lights and sound horn occasionally.\" The Arizona Department of Transportation's slogan for the best safety practices if caught driving when a haboob or dust storm hits is: \"Pull aside, stay alive.\"",
      "In Arizona on Monday, heavy rain measured over 2 inches, and wind speeds in the thunderstorm that followed the haboob were up to 66 mph.",
      "Where do haboobs occur?",
      "Haboobs occur \"fairly regularly\" in arid and semi-arid regions and can also be seen in dry regions, according to the Glossary of Meteorology.",
      "They can occur anywhere in the U.S. and are most common in the Southwest, according to the NWS.",

The letter reads, in part, \"I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening Andy but it's worse for me now\u2026 Every night I stay up thinking he might come in.\" Gardner says this is proof the abuse took place.",

      "Rossello says the abuse took place in the early 80's when he was a member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. Jose Menendez, top row, second from left, worked as an executive at RCA Records at the time and RCA signed Menudo to a recording contract.",

      "Prosecutors recommend resentencing of the Menendez brothers",
      "On Oct. 24, 2024, Gasc\u00f3n announced he will\u00a0ask the court for resentencing\u00a0in the case of Erik and Lyle Menendez, decades after the brothers were sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 killings of their parents in Beverly Hills. If the judge accepts his recommendation, the brothers would be immediately eligible for parole, he said.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said he will ask the judge to consider resentencing the brothers to 50 years to life. Because they committed the crimes when they were under the age of 26 years old, they would be eligible for parole, he said. Gasc\u00f3n said the final decision will be made by the judge, and then it would go before a parole board, which will determine if the brothers should be released.",

    "summary": "It's debated whether the AC should stay on or be turned off when people leave during the day. Here are some things to consider.",
    "story": [
      "Having air conditioning at home is a luxury that keeps people comfortable during the hottest months of the year, and it's debated whether the AC should stay on or be turned off when people leave during the day.",
      "Some swear that turning off the AC when they're gone for a few hours is the most energy-efficient, cost-saving method. Others say it's better to leave it running continuously, preventing the system from straining to rapidly cool the house down after the home has gotten warmer throughout the day.",
      "Three experts interviewed by The Associated Press agreed that setting the thermostat a few degrees higher than normal while you're away is generally the best way to balance energy efficiency against comfort and humidity.",
      "While turning an AC unit off for several hours and turning it back on typically saves money and energy compared to continuously running it, that approach can lead to mold problems in humid environments as well as wear and tear that can cause more frequent repairs. The equation can also vary depending on other factors including comfort level, AC unit type and building insulation.",
      "Air conditioning for residential and commercial buildings in the U.S. consumes about 4-7% of the nation's total energy consumption, according to a study Phelan co-authored. And according to\u00a0the latest Consumer Price Index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity costs rose 5.5% in July compared to one year ago.",
      "Here are things to consider.",
      "Humid vs. dry climates",
      "According to the U.S. Department of Energy, adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling.",
      "Experts say there are a lot of factors to consider when deciding what AC habits save the most energy and money.",
      "\"If you're gone for like 15 minutes to go to the grocery store, you don't get any gain\" by turning off your AC said Elizabeth Hewitt, professor and urban planning expert at Stony Brook University.",
      "But as a general rule, \"if you're going for your work day, say for eight hours or so, you'll almost always save more energy and money by turning things off,\" she said.",
      "In some climates, however, turning off the AC might not be feasible, so residents can set back their AC a few degrees instead of blasting cold air all day.",
      "In dry places like Arizona, you can let the home warm up more by raising the thermostat a few degrees higher. But in humid climates like Florida, air inside the home can become damp and harder to cool, and turning the AC off for long periods can increase the risk of mold since the system helps control indoor moisture.",
      "Bumping up the thermostat by 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) yields about a 3% savings in cooling costs, said Patrick Phelan, mechanical engineering professor at Arizona State University.",
      "Phelan also said leaving your AC off for hours and then turning it back on could lead to wear that results in more frequent repairs. That is because it can take AC systems 15 to 30 minutes after they are turned on to perform most efficiently.",
      "Type of home",
      "How much energy and money you can save depends on the kind of home you live in, said Gregor Henze, an architectural engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Homes built with heavy materials like concrete or brick hold in cool air longer, while older, draftier houses heat up faster.",
      "In less insulated homes, Henze said, it makes sense to adjust the thermostat even if you're stepping out for just a few hours, because the indoor temperature can rise quickly.",
      "AC unit and thermostat",
      "Whether you have a window unit, a smart thermometer or central air could influence your savings.",
      "Window units are generally less efficient because they're installed in an open window, making it difficult to seal out hot air completely, said Hewitt. She added that spraying \"cheap foam spray insulation in open windows or areas that are drafty is a really low-hanging fruit that doesn't cost a lot of money and really helps retain the indoor temperature in your home.\"",
      "Phelan says smart thermostats are a handy tool to remove the mental burden of tinkering with your manual thermostat multiple times a day. Smart thermostats \"learn\" by monitoring the occupancy with a sensor and raise the temperature when no one is home to conserve energy and lower it when people return.",
      "\"If you're going from just an ordinary manual thermostat to installing a smart one like a Nest, then you can expect something like 10% savings,\" said Phelan.",
      "Other ways to keep homes cool",
      "Each expert said simple steps like blocking sunlight can go a long way in keeping homes cool.",
      "Henze pointed to \"time-honored strategies\" such as opening windows at night when it's cooler. In dry climates, that night air doesn't add much moisture, but in humid regions it can bring in dampness the AC will later need to remove.",
      "Hewitt added that closing your blinds can make a difference of several degrees. Phelan also noted that some blinds are designed to reflect sunlight and said tinted window films are another option.",
      "Ceiling fans can also help. Experts recommend setting them to rotate counterclockwise during the summer so they push warm air down and keep a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that warm air is circulated throughout a room as it rises, Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project, told CBS News earlier this summer.",
      "Indoor plants can also be helpful by creating shade, and limiting oven use can help keep a space from warming up, according to experts.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",

      "Israel's military issued a statement Tuesday saying its preliminary investigation into a strike the previous day that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, at the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip had targeted a camera that it said was being used by Hamas for surveillance.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said troops in Khan Younis identified a camera \"being used to observe the activity of IDF troops, in order to direct terrorist activities against them.\"",
      "The IDF did not provide evidence to back the assertion, but said it was \"further supported\" by previously documented Hamas usage of hospitals \"by the terrorist organizations throughout the war, and by intelligence confirming Hamas' use of the Nasser Hospital to carry out terrorist activities since the start of the war.\"",
      "The Israeli military's explanation contrasted with a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a few hours after the incident, expressing regret for what he called a \"tragic mishap,\" with no suggestion of a specific Hamas target at the hospital.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" Netanyahu's office said in the statement released on social media. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "In what witnesses described as a double-tap strike by Israeli drones \u2014 with one missile striking the hospital followed by another as people gathered to assess the damage and attend to the wounded \u2014 five Palestinian journalists were killed on Monday.",
      "Their identities were confirmed as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa, Moaz Abu Taha and Ahmad Abu Aziz.",

      "The strike was among the deadliest of several that have hit hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war in Gaza, and it came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas in the densely populated Palestinian territory.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase to reach the scene of the first blast, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras.

      "President Trump, asked about the deadly strike on Monday, said he had been unaware until the question was put to him.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",

      "Banda Aceh, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Two men in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province were among a group of people publicly caned on Tuesday after an Islamic Shariah court convicted them of violating Islamic law by hugging and kissing, which the court ruled can lead to banned sexual relations.",
      "An audience of about 100 people witnessed the caning on a stage in Bustanussalatin city park in Banda Aceh on Tuesday. The men, aged 20 and 21, were whipped across their backs with a rattan cane dozens of times by a group of people wearing robes and hoods.",
      "Aceh allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex and sex between unmarried people. Caning is also a punishment in Aceh for gambling, drinking alcohol, women who wear tight clothes and men who do not attend Friday prayers.",
      "The court in Aceh sentenced the men to 80 strikes each after Islamic religious police said they caught them engaged in what the court deemed were the sexual acts of hugging and kissing in a bathroom of a public park, court records said.",
      "Eight other people were publicly caned Tuesday for adultery and gambling.",
      "The men were arrested in April at Taman Sari city park in Banda Aceh after residents told a police patrol they saw the men enter the same park bathroom. The police found the men inside kissing and hugging. Prior to meeting in the park, the pair made contact through an online dating app, court records said.",
      "Aceh is the only province in Indonesia to practice Shariah law. There have been four previous canings for cases related to homosexuality since the province implemented Islamic law and established a religious police and court system in 2006. The change was a concession by the national government to end a long-running separatist uprising.",
      "Indonesia's national criminal code does not regulate homosexuality but the central government cannot strike down Shariah law in Aceh. However, the central government previously pressured Aceh officials to drop an earlier version of a law calling for people to be stoned to death for adultery.",
      "Aceh expanded its Islamic bylaws and criminal code in 2015, extending Shariah law to non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the province's population. The verdict against the two men caned on Tuesday was the fifth handed down against people for homosexuality since the law was implemented in 2015.",
      "Two other men were publicly caned in February at the same Aceh park after a Shariah court convicted them of having sex.",
      "A coalition of human rights groups filed a petition to Indonesia's Supreme Court in 2016 seeking a review of Aceh's regional regulations allowing caning, but the request was rejected. Indonesia's Ministry of Home Affairs issued a letter in 2016 to Aceh's governor about caning, noting regional laws in Indonesia should be enforced for minor crimes.",
      "Canning is a corporal punishment and Indonesia has ratified a convention mandating the abolition of inhumane punishments, said Maidina Rahmawati, acting executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform in Indonesia.",
      "\"That public caning, even the act of caning itself, is contrary to various laws and regulations and also contrary to human rights interests in Indonesia because its exposure is not good for Indonesia,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Shifting political dynamics played a role in the implementation of the policy, Rahmawati said.",
      "\"Because it seemed like this was the right thing to do, it had to be done, it had to be narrated to support the Sharia-based government in Aceh,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Amnesty International issued a statement Tuesday calling the caning of the two men \"a disturbing act of state-sanctioned discrimination and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This punishment is a horrifying reminder of the institutionalized stigma and abuse faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in Aceh. Intimate relationships between consenting adults should never be criminalized,\" Amnesty's Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in the statement.",
      "Aulia Saputra, a Banda Aceh resident who attended the caning, said the punishment may prevent other violations of Shariah law.",
      "\"I hope that with the implementation of this caning punishment, it can serve as a lesson for the offender and also create a deterrent effect, so that such incidents do not happen again in the future,\" Saputra said.",

    "story": [
      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",

      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Iran of organizing two antisemitic attacks in Australia and said the country was cutting off diplomatic relations with Tehran in response on Tuesday.",
      "The Australian Security Intelligence Organization concluded the Iranian government had directed arson attacks on the Lewis Continental Kitchen, a kosher food company, in Sydney in October last year and on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne in December last year, Albanese said.",
      "Iran's government denied the allegations.",
      "There has been a steep rise in antisemitic incidents in Sydney and Melbourne since the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023.",

      "Police have already arrested at least one suspect in the Sydney cafe fire investigation and two suspects directly accused of torching the Melbourne synagogue.",
      "Sayed Mohammed Moosawi, a 32-year-old Sydney-based former chapter president of the Nomads biker gang, has been charged with directing the fire bombings of the Sydney caf\u00e9 as well as the nearby Curly Lewis Brewery. The brewery was apparently confused for the caf\u00e9 and mistakenly targeted three days earlier for an antisemitic attack.",
      "Giovanna Laulu, a 21-year-old man from Melbourne, was charged last month with being one of three masked arsonists who caused extensive damage to the synagogue in December.",
      "A second alleged arsonist, a 20-year-old man also from Melbourne, is expected to appear in court Wednesday, a police statement said. He has not been publicly named.",
      "\"ASIO has now gathered enough credible intelligence to reach a deeply disturbing conclusion,\" Albanese told reporters. \"The Iranian government directed at least two of these attacks. Iran has sought to disguise its involvement but ASIO assesses it was behind the attacks.",
      "\"These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\" he said. \"They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. It is totally unacceptable.\"",
      "Shortly before the announcement, the Australian government told Iran's Ambassador to Australia Ahmad Sadeghi that he will be expelled. It also withdrew Australian diplomats posted in Iran to a third country, Albanese said.",
      "An alert to Australians in Iran noted the embassy's closure and urged them to \"strongly consider leaving as soon as possible, if it is safe to do so.\"",
      "\"Foreigners in Iran, including Australians and dual Australian-Iranian nationals, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,\" the warning read.",

The Guard's Quds, or Jerusalem, Force is its expeditionary arm and is accused by Western nations of using local militants and criminals in the past to target dissidents and Israelis abroad.",
      "The U.S., during the first Trump administration in 2019, formally designated the Guard a foreign terrorist organization, accusing it not only facilitating, but perpetrating terrorism.",
      "A spokesperson for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry welcomed the terrorist designation for the Revolutionary Guard, adding in a statement that the group was \"outraged\" that a foreign actor was behind the crimes.",
      "\"Foremost, these were attacks that deliberately targeted Jewish Australians, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused millions of dollars of damage, and terrified our community,\" the statement said.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Israel has arrested several people on charges they had been paid or encouraged by Iran to carry out vandalism and monitor potential targets there.",
      "Iran denied Australia's allegations through its Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei, who tried to link it to the challenges Australia faced with Israel after announcing it would recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"It looks like the action, which is against Iran, diplomacy and the relations between the two nations, is a compensation for the criticism that the Australians had against the Zionist regime,\" Baghaei claimed.",
      "The move against Iran came a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded Albanese a \"weak politician who had betrayed Israel\" by recognizing a Palestinian state.",
      "Netanyahu's extraordinary public rebuke on social media came after an Aug. 11 announcement by Albanese that his government's recognition of a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. That announcement was followed by tit-for-tat cancellations of visas for Australian and Israeli officials.",
      "Albanese previously resisted calls to expel Iran's envoy to Canberra before, analysts said, including in 2024 when Sadeghi was summoned for meetings with foreign ministry officials over his social media posts.",

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip with a missile Monday and then fired another as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers in Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza\u00a0said. At least five journalists were among those killed, health officials and their employers said.",
      "It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and the attack came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets the tragic mishap\" that occurred at the hospital in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" the statement said. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "A hospital official initially told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at the hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "Middle East Eye, a U.K.-based media outlet, later said one of its freelancers, Ahmad Abu Aziz, was also killed.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Monday that he was not aware of the strike on the hospital and he was not happy about it when he learned the news.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable information available on war casualties, as such figures are difficult to independently verify, as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza.",
      "Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",

      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",

      "President Donald Trump. (Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "When Congress returns to session in September, debate about Washington, D.C.\u2019s \"home rule\" and the role of federal police in Washington will command much of lawmakers\u2019 attention.",
      "The District of Columbia is a federal city \u2013 ultimately answering to Congress and the president. And with thousands of National Guard troops now patrolling the streets, the role of those troops hinges on what lawmakers decide to do about it.",
      "DC STATEHOOD DEBATE INTENSIFIES AS TRUMP FLEXES AUTHORITY OVER LOCAL POLICE",
      "President Donald Trump speaks with members of law enforcement and National Guard soldiers, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo)",
      "D.C. had no control over its own affairs until Congress granted the capital city \"home rule\" in 1973. That established a city council and a mayor. However, Congress could always intervene and supplant local authority.",
      "Expect Democratic lawmakers to try to restore more local control over the Washington, D.C., streets via legislation when Congress reconvenes. And anticipate that Republicans will do their best to wrest power from the city.",
      "The 1973 Home Rule Act authorizes the president to seize control of the city\u2019s police for up to a month if an \"emergency\" exists. President Trump is well versed in declaring everything from the border to trade policy an \"emergency.\" So Mr. Trump took advantage of that legal loophole to dispatch National Guard troops onto the streets of Washington.",
      "Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is pushing legislation to allow President Trump to run police operations in the District of Columbia for six months. Biggs also wants to alter the section of the Home Rule Act for potential emergencies in the future. President Trump controls the D.C. National Guard since the District of Columbia is not a state. The local home rule provision doesn\u2019t limit how long the president can deploy forces.",
      "CAPITOL HILL PREPARES FOR HIGH-STAKES BATTLE OVER TRUMP CRIME PACKAGE, DC POLICE AUTHORITY",
      "Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., speaks during a news conference on border security and funding on January 10, 2024.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Biggs has been busy. The Arizona Republican also crafted a bill to crack down on cash bail for Washington, D.C., defendants. Biggs\u2019 measure would prohibit defendants from skipping out on court appearances under the premise that they\u2019ll pay up if let free after an arrest.",
      "Not to be outdone, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., prepped a measure giving the president the power to control D.C. \u2013 under the emergency provisions \u2013 for as long as he wants. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., wants to grant President Trump the authority to run the capital until his term expires in January 2029.",
      "Ogles has already teamed up with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to write a bill which essentially strips Washington, D.C., of all home rule.",
      "These are all plans Republicans have for the city. However, this is legislation we\u2019re talking about. And it\u2019s unclear if any of this could skate through the GOP-controlled House with a narrow majority. House Republicans now hold a 219-212 margin after the resignation of former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., in July. And while most Republican lawmakers are no fan of D.C. and want to support President Trump, it\u2019s not a done deal that the House can pass anything.",
      "TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO ELIMINATE NO-CASH BAIL FOR SUSPECTS IN DC AND NATIONWIDE",
      "Members of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and police patrol near Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (Jose Luis Gonzalez/REUTERS)",
      "Some House Republicans could reject the legislation under the premise that they support \"federalism\" and would prefer local people to control local affairs \u2013 even if D.C. faces a crime problem. Moreover, they worry about the precedent they could set for a Democratic president and what he or she may do when they\u2019re in power.",
      "Regardless, advancing any of this through the United States Senate is tough. Legislation requires two rounds of 60 yeas to break filibusters. And Republicans only command 53 Senate seats. In addition, the Senate has never shown the same level of interest in meddling with Washington, D.C.\u2019s affairs compared to the House of Representatives.",
      "So those are the Republican plans. One can envision the Democrats\u2019 efforts are to either protect D.C. from such congressional or presidential intervention \u2013 or undo President Trump\u2019s action via legislation. But while Democrats often band together to safeguard the city from outside influences, Washington must often rely on regional lawmakers like Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to do the hard work. D.C. has one non-voting delegate to the House, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. And no senators.",
      "In addition, Republicans have tapped into a narrative that Washington, D.C., isn\u2019t safe. So that works outside the Beltway. It also doesn\u2019t burn much political capital for congressional Republicans to meddle in D.C.\u2019s local affairs \u2013 if that\u2019s what President Trump wants. So that pleases the GOP base.",
      "By contrast, congressional Democrats must tread carefully. Crime in big cities is a hot-button issue. Republicans appear to have the public\u2019s support on issues of \"law and order\" \u2013 and taking on large cities \"run by Democrats.\" If Democrats don\u2019t finesse this the right way, it\u2019s possible that a full-throated defense of the District of Columbia is not the message the party needs to send to swing voters they\u2019re trying to court in the heartland.",

Comer wants to hear from former 3rd District Commander Michael Pulliam. He\u2019s now on leave after facing allegations of altering DC crime reports.",

The deadline to do that is Oct. 1. So heavy concentration on keeping the federal lights on may give D.C. a brief reprieve.",
      "But congressional oversight over D.C. isn\u2019t evaporating any time soon. Congress is essentially a type of super-city council for the District of Columbia. Which means the Capitol is kind of like city hall.",
      "It has long been said that \"you can\u2019t fight city hall.\" And with Republicans now in charge, there may be little that congressional Democrats can do to pry back local power in the nation\u2019s capital.",

      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",
      "Using a data removal service helps clean up your digital footprint. By reducing the amount of exposed information about you, it becomes much harder for scammers to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",
      "Google offers several 2FA methods, from SMS codes to app-based prompts and even hardware security keys. For the best protection, choose app-based or hardware verification rather than text messages.",
      "Many scams rely on exploiting outdated software. If your phone, browser, or operating system isn't up to date, attackers may use known vulnerabilities to install malware or hijack your session.",

      "The incident is a reminder that even tech giants with vast resources are not immune to security lapses. While Google insists that no passwords were exposed, the wave of phishing and vishing scams shows how quickly criminals can weaponize even partial leaks. What began as a breach of business data has spiraled into a threat facing millions of everyday users, raising questions about how secure Google's ecosystem really is.",

      "Google's Pixel 10 lineup is the heart of this year's Made by Google event. With the Tensor G5 chip, brighter displays, and new AI-powered camera tools, the series delivers meaningful upgrades for everyday users. Here's what each model brings and why it matters.",

      "The Pixel 10 brings big improvements without the Pro price tag. It features a 6.3-inch OLED Actua display that's brighter than ever, making outdoor use easy. Google also added better bass in the speakers, so movies, music, and calls sound richer.",
      "The headline feature is the first 5x telephoto lens on a base Pixel, complete with 10x optical-quality zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom. For anyone who loves capturing moments from a distance, kids' soccer games, concerts, or city skylines, this is a huge advancement forward.",
      "The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL models push Pixel photography even further. They introduce Pro Res Zoom up to 100x, powered by generative AI on the Tensor G5 chip. That means close-up shots with detail you'd normally need a DSLR to capture.",
      "Both the Pro (6.3-inch) and Pro XL (6.8-inch) feature Google's brightest Super Actua displays, larger batteries, and up to 16 GB of RAM for faster performance. These phones are made for power users who want the very best in cameras, speed, and AI tools.",
      "A Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold display is shown. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google's most durable foldable yet, designed for people who want a phone that doubles as a tablet. With an upgraded gearless hinge, IP68 water and dust resistance, and a larger battery, it's built to last years of folding and unfolding.",

      "The Pixel 10, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold all run on the brand-new Tensor\u202fG5 chip, which Google calls its most significant upgrade to date. The chip is made by TSMC using a 3nm process, delivering faster, more efficient on-device AI performance with Gemini Nano at its core. Across the entire lineup, Google made thoughtful design upgrades. The iconic camera bar has been refined, the bodies use more recycled materials, and the colors are elegant and modern. Choices include Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass on Pixel 10, and Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, and Porcelain on the Pro models.",
      "FOLDABLE PHONES ARE IMPRESSIVE TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS BUT COME WITH SERIOUS COMPROMISES",

They deliver premium features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and hands-free AI help, all at an affordable $129. With a fresh design, better sound, and smarter connectivity, these buds bring everyday value to anyone who wants high performance without breaking the bank.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a are smaller and lighter than the earlier A-series, making them comfortable enough to wear all day. Inspired by the Pixel Buds Pro 2, they include a twist-to-adjust stabilizer and four different eartips so you can find the perfect fit. With an IP54 sweat and water resistance rating, you don't have to worry about rain or workouts. The buds also come in two stylish colors, iris and hazel, designed to complement other Pixel devices.",
      "At the heart of Pixel Buds 2a is the Tensor A1 chip, built specifically for audio. This brings Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5, a first for Google's A-series. A custom speaker driver and new high-frequency chamber enhance music and podcast quality. Wind-blocking mesh covers and Google AI improve call clarity, so your voice sounds crisp on the other end.",
      "Battery life also gets a boost. You'll enjoy 7 hours on a single charge with ANC on, and up to 20 hours with the charging case. With ANC off, you get nearly double the listening time compared to the first-generation A-series. For the first time, the case itself includes a replaceable battery, making the buds more durable and sustainable.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a work as more than headphones; they're also your AI companion. With Gemini built in, you can get quick answers, check messages, or even ask for coffee shop recommendations on the go. Just say \"Hey Google\" or customize the press-and-hold gesture for instant help.",

      "A Pixel Watch 4 is seen with a pink wristband and display. (Google)",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is Google's biggest smartwatch upgrade yet. It keeps the iconic round look but introduces a domed Actua 360 display that's brighter, larger, and easier to see, even in direct sunlight. The screen is 50% brighter, the bezels are smaller, and everything feels more fluid thanks to new animations and stronger haptics. Simply put, it looks better and feels more responsive on your wrist.",
      "Battery life has always been a concern for smartwatches. Google addressed it with a 25% boost. The 41mm model now lasts up to 30 hours, while the 45mm model stretches to 40 hours. With Battery Saver mode, you can extend usage to two or even three days. Plus, the new Quick Charge Dock takes you from 0 to 50% in just 15 minutes, making it easier to power up before you head out.",
      "One of the most groundbreaking features is standalone satellite connectivity. Pixel Watch 4 LTE is the first smartwatch that can dial emergency services even when you're off the grid. Whether you're hiking, camping, or driving in remote areas, the watch can connect to geo-stationary satellites and get help when you need it most. That's peace of mind you can actually wear.",
      "Health remains a core focus. Pixel Watch 4 adds more accurate sleep tracking, enhanced skin temperature sensing, and dual-frequency GPS for precise route logging in tough environments. Cyclists will love the new real-time bike stats, while fitness fans get 50+ exercise modes, including pickleball and basketball. Even if you forget to start a workout, the watch's AI now auto-detects and logs your activity.",
      "With Gemini AI built in, the Pixel Watch 4 goes beyond tracking; it coaches. A new personal AI health coach gives proactive fitness and sleep advice tailored to your goals. It's like having a trainer and wellness guide on your wrist, available anytime. A preview of this feature arrives in October through the Fitbit app, opening the door to personalized, AI-driven health support.",
      "WWDC 2025: IOS 26, LIQUID GLASS DESIGN AND APPLE\u2019S AI SHORTFALL",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 isn't just about health. With Gemini on your wrist, you can get answers or complete tasks hands-free. Raise your wrist to talk, respond to messages with smart replies, or control your day without pulling out your phone. It's designed for those busy, in-between moments, when your hands are full but you still need help.",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is available for\u00a0preorder now. It launches Oct. 9 with pricing starting at\u00a0$349 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$449 for LTE in the 41mm size, and\u00a0$399 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$499 for LTE in the 45mm size.

      "Pixelsnap and Qi2 Charging: Magnetic power made simple",
      "A Pixelsnap Charger, Pixelsnap Ring Stand and the Pixel Flex 67W Dual USB-C fast charger are showcased. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 series is the first major Android lineup to fully embrace Qi2 magnetic charging. Think of it as Google's answer to MagSafe, only it works with a wider range of devices. Qi2 improves on the old Qi standard by adding magnets, so your phone snaps perfectly into place every time. No more fiddling with alignment, charging is instant and reliable.",
      "This upgrade matters because it unlocks a full ecosystem of Pixelsnap accessories, built to make charging and everyday use easier. And since Qi2 is a universal standard, you're not limited to Google's products; you can also use MagSafe accessories with your Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.",
      "The Pixelsnap Charger comes as a simple puck or bundled with a sleek stand. It charges the Pixel 10 Pro XL at up to 25W and other Qi2-certified devices at 15W. The stand looks elegant on a desk or nightstand, and the puck detaches for charging on the go. If you own a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the stand even supports charging while unfolded, letting you stream, video call, or display widgets on the big screen as your phone powers up.",
      "Need hands-free viewing? The Pixelsnap Ring Stand snaps onto the back of your phone for propping it up. It rotates smoothly thanks to a microfiber liner, making it easy to find the perfect angle for movies or video calls. Slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, it adds function without adding bulk.",
      "Google designed its new Pixel 10 cases to be Pixelsnap-ready. That means you can attach chargers or accessories without ever removing the case. Available in colors like Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, Porcelain, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass, they not only protect your phone but also match the refreshed Pixel 10 design.",
      "If you prefer wired charging, Google also introduced the Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger. It's the fastest dual-port charger yet for Pixel phones. Thanks to a custom algorithm, it prioritizes charging your Pixel first while still powering a second device. Compact with foldable prongs, it's designed to travel as easily as you do.",
      "All Pixelsnap products and the\u00a0Pixel 10 series are available for\u00a0preorder now, with retail availability starting\u00a0August 28.",
      "AI Features: Magic Cue, Camera Coach, and more",
      "An image of the Tensor G5 chip is seen. (Google)",
      "Google made it clear at the 2025 Made by Google event that AI is now at the heart of the Pixel experience. With the Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano, Pixel 10 phones deliver more than speed-they anticipate what you need and help you get it done.",
      "The new Magic Cue acts like a personal assistant inside your phone. It proactively pulls information you need at just the right time. For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",
      "Features like Best Take automatically select the sharpest face from a series of photos, making group shots easier than ever. Meanwhile, Pro Res Zoom, exclusive to Pixel 10 Pro models, uses a generative AI imaging model to deliver astonishing detail up to 100x zoom. It's not just cropping in, it's rebuilding and refining the image to look crisp.",
      "Beyond photography, Google packed the Pixel 10 with over 20 generative AI tools that work directly on the device. They help with editing, writing, and even composing replies in your favorite apps. The goal is simple: make the phone feel less like a tool and more like a helpful companion that adapts to your needs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google just staged one of its most memorable launches yet. With Fallon, Curry, Norris, and the Jonas Brothers front and center, the event blended entertainment and innovation. That energy carried through to the devices, which brought Google's boldest AI, camera, and ecosystem upgrades so far. Each product offered clear value. The Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano AI make everything faster and more efficient. The Pixel 10 phones push photography and performance further than before. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 adds health coaching and even satellite emergency support. The Pixel Buds 2a also pack premium sound and smart features at a budget price. In addition, Pixelsnap accessories make charging simple and stylish. Finally, Google's promise of seven years of updates sets this lineup apart.

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on President Donald Trump's goal to put a nuclear reactor on the moon on 'Special Report.'",
      "A Harvard physicist who sounded the alarm earlier this month about a rare interstellar object passing through our solar system \u2014 suggesting it might be more than a comet \u2014 now says it could even be a nuclear-powered spaceship.",
      "The object, 3I/ATLAS, was first detected in early July by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It marks only the third time an interstellar object has been observed entering our solar system, according to NASA.",
      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",
      "In a blog post this week, Loeb wrote that the object\u2019s brightness profile cannot be explained by sunlight reflection or standard cometary outgassing.",

      "Instead, he suggested, 3I/ATLAS might be generating its own light, possibly from nuclear energy.",
      "\"Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,\" Loeb wrote. \"This cannot be ruled out, but requires better evidence to be viable.\"",
      "Loeb dismissed other natural power sources. A primordial black hole, he said, would generate only about 20 nanowatts \u2014 far too weak. A radioactive fragment from a supernova was highly unlikely given its rarity, and frictional heating from interstellar gas and dust was ruled out by momentum and density constraints.",

      "That leaves the simplest explanation \u2014 a central, compact, high-power source. The most natural way to achieve the gigawatt-level luminosity observed, Loeb noted, would be nuclear power.",
      "Still, Loeb does not claim the object is nuclear-powered. He stresses there is only one possible interpretation if natural models fail, and proving it would require more evidence.",
      "3I/ATLAS is estimated to be about 20 kilometers across, larger than Manhattan.",
      "Loeb has also raised questions about its unusual trajectory.",

    "story": [
      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",
      "Arthur from Cape Coral, Florida, recently reached out with an experience that mirrors what others have been describing:",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "Arthur is right to question what's happening. Scammers are deliberately using real email addresses to push fraudulent purchases through retailer systems with fewer checks. They rely on your email to carry out the scam, even if they have not stolen your payment details.",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) so hackers can\u2019t get in even if they\u2019ve stolen your password. A password manager makes this much easier by generating and securely storing complex passwords, helping you avoid the risks of reuse.",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "HOW TO TELL IF A LOGIN ALERT IS REAL OR A SCAM",
      "Even if no purchases appear under your name, scams involving your email can be a red flag for future identity misuse. Set up alerts with your bank and consider a credit monitoring service to catch unauthorized activity early.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "In your email settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), check for any connected apps, services or delegated access you don't recognize and remove them. This ensures no third party is piggybacking off your account.",
      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

      "Murdoch Children's Institute clinical science research director Dr. Vicki Anderson explains how the app will help parents and coaches rapidly assess injuries and determine how to treat them on 'Varney & Co.'",
      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",
      "NEW MOBILE ROBOT HELPS SENIORS WALK SAFELY AND PREVENT FALLS",
      "6) Leak sensors help prevent unexpected slips",

      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",
      "What to look for: A model with two-way audio gives you the freedom to communicate from wherever you are in your home.",

      "Doorbell cameras enable users to communicate with visitors without rushing to answer the door. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

      "Many smartwatches and medical alert devices can detect when a user falls and offer the option to call for help. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Voice assistants like\u00a0Alexa or\u00a0Google Nest can help you call someone, turn on a light, or get a reminder, without having to move.",
      "What to look for: Set up voice shortcuts and routines for common tasks. If you're unsteady, saying \"Call my daughter\" is a lot safer than walking to your phone.",

      "10) Balance-training apps keep your brain and body in sync",
      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",
      "Using apps to perform balance exercises and cognitive challenges can help keep reflexes honed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Falls aren't only about tripping on a rug or losing your footing. They often involve deeper issues like poor sleep, medication interactions, or delayed reflexes. By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being.

      "To address growing concerns, OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT. These updates will limit how the chatbot responds to mental health-related queries.

      "On Saturday, Israeli tanks and troops began maneuvering ever closer to Gaza City\u2019s outskirts in preparation for a\u00a0full-scale offensive. Eyewitness accounts reported intensified shelling as Israel is moving toward what could be the defining battle of its war against Hamas terrorists: the capture of Gaza City.",
      "Israel's security cabinet approved the operation, known as Gideon\u2019s Chariots B, and has deployed up to five IDF divisions toward the city\u2019s outskirts\u2014a highly significant mobilization. Thousands of reservists\u2014some 60,000\u2014have been called up.",
      "John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, told Fox News Digital the scale of this operation is unprecedented. \"This will be a bigger challenge than anything\u00a0the IDF has faced, arguably ever. It is the densest location in Gaza, the heart of Hamas\u2019s stronghold. And you don\u2019t really know what the tunnels are until you get into them.\"",

      "Spencer said that \"Hamas built semi-circles of defenses oriented at Israel. But the IDF has shown creativity in maneuvering around obstacles.\" Israel plans to send more combat power into Gaza City than it has deployed across the entire Strip thus far. \"If your goal is to clear Gaza City of Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and search for hostages, you need that scale,\" he said.",
      "Gadi Shamni, former commander of the Gaza Division and ex-head of IDF Central Command, told Fox News Digital, \"It is a crowded city with refugee camps, dense neighborhoods, high-rises and a highly developed underground. People say the IDF controls above and below ground, but in the last campaign we saw that wasn\u2019t always true. Even when you destroy tunnels, Hamas can rebuild them quickly. The longer you stay with more forces, the more opportunities you create for the other side to attack.\"",
      "A former senior Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital, \"The IDF can militarily conquer Gaza, but the costs will be immense on both sides. The IDF will fight with a method of \u2018destroy everything first\u2019\u2014air force bombs, massive charges, detonating streets from afar, wiping out entire areas and advancing slowly.",

      "\"The IDF has gained enormous experience over the past two years and will use those tactics in this battle.\u2026 You are strong, the enemy is weak, and you have patience. Even the weather is on Israel\u2019s side, with winter not arriving until January.\"",
      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",
      "The former Israeli senior security official described the operation as \"telescopic\u2014very slow, with pistons working one by one. This pace also gives Hamas the chance at every stage to try to cut a deal.\"",

      "Shamni also warned Hamas may relocate hostages, 50 hostages, of whom 20 are still believed to be alive, into combat zones to deter strikes\u2014a tactic he said the IDF would be reluctant to engage for fear of harming captives, a conflict between military necessity and core values.",
      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",

      "Security experts have since been sounding the alarm that the move further exposes Taiwan\u2019s vulnerabilities to China as the island is highly dependent on energy imports, relying heavily on nations like the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar for both Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and crude oil imports.",

      "Though prior to its decision to cut ties with the alternative energy option, nuclear power was a strong supply source and provided nearly 12% of the island\u2019s needs in 2011.",
      "By 2021, that supply had dropped to roughly 9.5%, and, by the following year, it had dipped to just over 4% before being eliminated this year.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",
      "ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LEADERS SEEK TO EASE RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN CONCERNS AFTER US-BROKERED PEACE DEAL",
      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

      "As of Aug. 12, the U.N. Office for Project Services showed that 3,140 trucks have been intercepted en route to their destinations since May 19. Only 412 trucks, 11.6% of the total sent into the region, reached their targeted location. The U.N. said the aid was taken \"either peacefully by hungry people or forcefully armed actors.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the often-maligned U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) out-of-the-box aid delivery mechanisms continue to show success, according to the group. Theft and looting have not been an issue for the GHF, which continues to provide between one and two million meals per day through distribution sites secured by armed guards. GHF has provided over 130 million meals since the start of its operations on May 27.",
      "\"The presence of armed security is one of the reasons why GHF has been able to deliver aid successfully without a single truck being looted,\" noting that \"in one of the most volatile and complex operating environments in the world, that security is the only reason food consistently reaches civilians without interference from Hamas.\"",
      "Though a group of about 230 NGOs initially rejected the organization on account of what they called \"militarized distribution sites,\" Chapin Fay, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation spokesperson, said things might be changing as over 200 international organizations, \"sent a letter calling on the U.N. to collaborate with us.\"",
      "\"This is not the militarization of aid\u2026 It is the only way to make sure food actually reaches civilians. Every decision we make is guided by protecting lives.\"",

      "\"In order to reach people in Gaza facing starvation, we need a predictable lifeline of aid via all available crossings and through all available corridors.

      "When Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift announced their engagement, Swifties everywhere had an immediate follow-up question: What are the details of the ring?",
      "The massive diamond that now rests upon Swift's left ring finger is set in yellow gold, its bright sparkle featured in the couple's engagement announcement on Instagram.",
      "NBC News can confirm that Kelce purchased the ring \u2014 which features four prongs and a button back, or a small bezel around the stone \u2014 at Artifex Fine Jewelry, an online jeweler that claims to craft jewelry with natural stones.",
      "The ring is an old mine brilliant cut \u2014 or an antique elongated cushion \u2014 that is approximately 8 to 10 carats, Stephanie Gottlieb, founder and creative director at Stephanie Gottlieb Fine Jewelry, said in an email.",
      "Lauren B. Shmueli, a luxury ring specialist and diamond expert of Lauren B Jewelry, said she suspects the diamond is 7 to 8 carats and appears to have a clarity of VS1 or higher.",
      "A natural diamond this size could range anywhere from $400,000 to $800,000, depending on the particular specs, Gottlieb explained.",
      "The Clear Cut, a New York City-based jeweler specializing in engagement rings, stated in a TikTok that the diamond appears to be a \u201cspready stone,\u201d allowing \u201cwindowing\u201d in its facets, which makes the exact size difficult to determine. But if they had to guess, they said the ring looks like it's between 4 and 7 carats.",
      "Gottlieb was unable to pinpoint the exact color or clarity of the diamond, but said it appears \"warmer\" than other diamonds, a characteristic typical of antiques.",
      "\"From the picture, it appears to have the warmth you typically find in antiques, which really adds to the character and overall beauty of a natural diamond,\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Gottlieb described the antique cushion cut as \"a little bit more unique,\" especially at a time when lab-grown diamonds are all the rage.",
      "\"Antique stones offer character that you can't replicate,\" Gottlieb said.",
      "The Clear Cut also highlighted the \"vintage charm\" of antique cut stone, noting that each is one of a kind.",
      "Shmueli explained via text message that antique cushions are known for their \"soft curved edges and distinctive checkerboard faceting pattern, which lends the stone exceptional character.\"",
      "Gottlieb added that the stone stands out because of how elongated it is, and does not look like a \"typical\" cushion shape. The Clear Cut also pointed out how the elongated shape complements Swift's long fingers.",
      "She was also quick to point out the setting \u2014\u00a0a \"thicker yellow gold tapered band with burnished side stones,\" Gottlieb said, adding that the side stones might have a sentimental value to Swift and Kelce.",
      "Shmueli added that the detailing on the setting \"gracefully frames the stone,\" and the band is \"tapered and etched with fine engraving detailing, which completes the design, enhancing the ring's heritage aesthetic.\"",
      "Artifex, the jeweler where the ring was purchased, was promoting a \"from the vault...\" collection on its website as of Tuesday afternoon. The phrasing may be a callout to some of Swift's most recently released tracks, which accompanied her \"Taylor's Version\" re-recordings. Swift said these tracks were written years ago, but didn't make it onto the original album."

      "The pitch was simple: How\u2019d you like to make some extra money with just a few taps on your phone?",
      "Start by investing a small amount \u2014 say, a couple thousand dollars \u2014 in a high-tech scooter-sharing company based in Hong Kong. Watch from your phone as the electric scooters get rented and your money doubles, then triples. Recruit your friends and family and earn even more. Win a cruise or a Tesla.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity,\u201d urged a marketing video for Lightning Shared Scooter Co.",
      "Skeptical?",
      "Small-town mayors endorsed the company, known as LSSC. So did police officers and a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared to give it a shoutout on Cameo, where people ask public figures to record online messages. A photo of French soccer star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was used to promote it.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t good enough, LSSC storefronts and offices popped up in at least eight cities across the United States filled with sleek black scooters \u2014 which really worked \u2014 and the requisite state paperwork to prove it was all real.",
      "Patricia Livingstone, a group home manager from Philadelphia, poured in close to $11,000 of her savings, thinking the earnings could help support her mother\u2019s retirement in Liberia. Aisha Komara, a nursing assistant from Minnesota, invested $18,000 for a chance at \u201cfinancial security\u201d for her family. Oliver Mayson, a security professional in New Jersey, put in $65,000 after his sister convinced him and his brother it was genuine.",
      "They logged on to the LSSC app at night, because they believed the people renting the scooters were in Hong Kong. They hit a button to \u201crun\u201d their scooters, then watched as payment for the four-hour rentals ticked up in their accounts.",
      "Until last month, when Livingstone, Komara, Mayson and potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of other app users discovered they were unable to withdraw their \u201caccumulated income.\u201d",
      "A devastating realization sunk in: It was a scam.",
      "\u201cThere were police officers promoting this. People in the military. Mayors. I\u2019m seeing videos from all these important people \u2014 I believed,\u201d Mayson, 41, said as his 2-year-old son played at his feet in their Newark home.",
      "\u201cI feel upset,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel duped.\u201d",
      "The mass deception has exploded hopes of financial stability in immigrant and lower-income communities that invested heavily in the scam, in which, some say, they dug into their savings or their children\u2019s college funds. The scheme was built on trust \u2014 people enlisted family members, friends, fellow churchgoers, co-workers to sign up and invest. Now the victims are using social media to warn others.",
      "The scam has caught the attention of law enforcement in at least six states, with Kyle Hoffman, a police officer in Arlington County, Virginia, estimating the amount of money lost to the fraud nationwide is easily \u201cin the millions.\u201d Hoffman said he is working on the investigation with the FBI\u2019s Richmond field office; the FBI declined to comment. In Salinas, California, police say, the number of victims has reached more than five dozen with a combined loss of $370,734. NBC News interviewed a dozen people across the United States who say that, combined, they injected more than $190,000 into LSSC with little to nothing to show for it.",
      "Investment scams cheated U.S. consumers out of $5.7 billion last year, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which said crooks use sophisticated online measures to make it extremely difficult to catch them and get victims\u2019 money back. The FTC said it doesn\u2019t comment on specific companies or potential investigations. The Better Business Bureau, which labeled LSSC a \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d last week, said it had received complaints from 20 states."

      "Cracker Barrel on Monday tried to tamp down the controversy by admitting \" we could\u2019ve done a better job sharing who we are and who we\u2019ll always be\" and issuing reassurances that its values had not changed.",
      "The change was part of a \u201cstrategic transformation\u201d that started in 2024 to revitalize the brand, CNBC reported when the new logo was introduced. The company has said that the initiative included \"refreshing the brand identity\" and  making changes to its menu.",
      "Other companies have been met with right-wing outrage for advertising or other business decisions, including when Bud Light had a branded content partnership with transgender TikToker Dylan Mulvaney."

      "The local response to Trump's \"federal takeover\" of D.C. was mixed, with some crediting him for taking an active interest in public safety in the city and others criticizing him for a buildup they described as unnecessary or aimed at the wrong parts of the city.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t have no problem with police presence,\u201d said Brian Williams, 56, who reported seeing National Guard, FBI and local police forces in the neighborhood. \u201cIt\u2019s much-needed in certain neighborhoods of the district. Not all of them is needed, but some of them is needed.\u201d",
      "But, Williams added, \"the ones that's needed, you don't see the presence in there.\"",
      "Some residents said they had not seen National Guard or federal agents in their neighborhood at all, and a Washington Post map of such sightings, published Aug. 15, showed a much heavier presence in the wealthier and more tourist-trafficked wards west of the Anacostia River.",
      "Trump had boasted Monday that it had been \u201cmany years since we went a week without having a murder.\u201d (D.C. had a 16-day streak earlier this year.) National Guard troops began arriving in D.C. on Aug. 12 in response to Trump\u2019s declaration of a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Federal agents are focused on arresting violent offenders, including drug dealers \u2014 often by executing warrants \u2014 rather than patrolling neighborhoods, according to a White House official.",
      "\u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s bold action, federal and local officers have been going into high-crime areas all across the Washington, D.C., to stop dangerous criminals,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. \"In fact, the violent crime plaguing the city\u2019s communities is exactly why President Trump is cracking down on crime and restoring law and order. The Trump Administration will not rest until D.C. is the safest city in the country.\u201d",

      "Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was sentenced to 89 days in jail \u2014 the amount of time that he spent misleading authorities, Green Lake County Circuit Court Judge Mark Slate said before announcing the jail term.",
      "Borgwardt, who appeared in a white checkered button-up and gray pants, was also ordered to pay $30,000 in costs associated with a search effort that lasted nearly two months.",
      "In a brief statement to the court, the father of three said he deeply regretted his actions and the pain he caused his family and friends.",
      "Green Lake County District Attorney Gerise LaSpisa told the court that Borgwardt spent months researching the scheme in an effort to disappear from his life in Wisconsin and create a new one in the country of Georgia, formerly of the Soviet Union.",
      "He reversed a vasectomy, took out a large life insurance policy, obtained a new passport and transferred money overseas, LaSpisa said. He researched how to fake a drowning and chose Green Lake, with its average depth of 100 feet, because he believed \"a body would not surface,\" she said.",
      "Borgwardt then traveled to Georgia to be with a woman whom he'd met online, the prosecutor said.",
      "\"His entire plan to fake his death, to devastate his family in order to serve his own selfish desires hinged on him dying in the lake and selling his death to the world,\" LaSpisa said.",

      "According to a criminal complaint, LaSpisa said that Borgwardt had actually used a small inflatable boat to return to shore and an electric bike to ride to Madison. He then fled the country, heading first to Canada and later to Georgia, LaSpisa said.",
      "Authorities were able to track his overseas travels in part because he used the new passport he'd obtained in Canada.",
      "Borgwardt\u2019s plan unraveled when a Russian-speaking woman contacted deputies in Green Lake County and connected them with Borgwardt, according to the complaint. The sheriff\u2019s office later released a clip of a video call authorities had with him.",

Yet as the team's backups played during preseason exhibitions for the past three weeks, and as the NFL's deadline to trim rosters to 53 players arrived Tuesday, the Browns' decision on one position in particular was constantly dissected.",

      "At 40 years old and entering his 18th NFL season, Flacco isn't considered a long-term option as Cleveland's starter, which underscores the competition for his primary backup. The pecking order largely determines practice opportunities during the season.",
      "Sanders completed 14 of his 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns without a sack while starting during Cleveland's preseason opener on Aug. 8; Gabriel was unavailable with a hamstring injury.",

Both played in the preseason finale last week, with Gabriel completing 12 of his 19 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown, while Sanders was 3-for-6 for 14 yards but was sacked five times. The sacks highlighted a particular criticism from draft evaluators about Sanders' deep drops in the pocket, and how they could lead to sacks.",
      "When Cleveland removed Sanders and played another backup, Tyler Huntley, for the final two minutes of the game, it further aggravated a discussion that had been raging for weeks on social media about whether the rookie quarterbacks were being given equal opportunities. Among those critical were Shannon Sharpe and former NFL receiver Chad Johnson, who on their YouTube show blamed the team for their handling of the quarterback repetitions.",

      "DOGE staffers were given \u201cimproper and excessive access\u201d to multiple databases with sensitive information in March, the complaint says. A federal judge blocked them from accessing SSA data that month, but the Supreme Court overturned that ruling in June.",

      "Numident (numerical identification system) contains Social Security numbers as well as an individual's name, address, place of birth, their parents\u2019 names and other personal data.",
      "An official agency security assessment at the time, which is cited in the complaint, described copying the database to the server as \u201chigh-risk\u201d given that \u201cmost security exposures and breaches occur within development environments due to reduced control measures and oversight.\u201d The assessment warned of \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d to Social Security beneficiaries and programs if the database were breached.",

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Trump risks economic calamity by tampering with Fed independence",
      "Economic and financial analysts are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor risks undermining the central bank\u2019s independence \u2014 something that could ultimately put U.S. households\u2019 finances at risk.",
      "Late Monday, Trump moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. He cited a \u201ccriminal referral\u201d from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte that alleged discrepancies on Cook\u2019s mortgage application documents. Cook has refused to step down, and on Tuesday she said she was planning to file a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s move.",
      "Cook serves on the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee for setting interest rates throughout the economy. To determine where that rate should be, the committee members weigh risks to unemployment and inflation. When the job market starts to look weak, the Fed tends to lower rates. When the risk from inflation is greater, it tends to increase them. Both moves carry risks: Higher rates can stifle economic growth, while lower rates can lead to ballooning inflation.",
      "Trump has called for lower rates since taking office, citing a general desire to bolster economic growth while dismissing concerns about inflation. While past presidents have expressed views about monetary policy, Trump\u2019s attempts at influence are largely unprecedented \u2014 no Fed member has ever been removed for cause.",
      "It\u2019s setting off alarm bells, not simply over disagreements about interest rate levels, but for what undue influence on the Fed could do to the economy. Academics have consistently concluded that meddling with the independence of central banks like the Federal Reserve can lead to worsening inflation, since it removes a key check on the government\u2019s tendency to borrow as much money as it can.",
      "\u201cPresidential capture of the Fed would signal to decision-makers throughout the economy that interest rates will no longer be set on the basis of sound data or economic conditions \u2014 but instead on the whims of the president,\u201d the Economic Policy Institute said in a statement.",

      "What Trump\u2019s executive order on flag burning actually does",
      "President Donald Trump touched off a tempest yesterday by announcing that he had signed an executive order banning flag burning and penalizing the act with a one-year prison sentence.",
      "Some on the political right criticized the unilateral limitation of a liberty often associated with free speech.",
      "\u201cI would never in a million years harm the American flag,\u201d conservative radio host Jesse Kelly wrote on X. \u201cBut a president telling me I can\u2019t has me as close as I\u2019ll ever be to lighting one on fire. I am a free American citizen. And if I ever feel like torching one, I will. This is garbage.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not surprising, given the president\u2019s assertion, that some folks were confused about his powers. But he still does not have the authority to make laws or to create criminal penalties for violating them on his own. He needs Congress to do that.",
      "As many of his critics noted, along with some of his allies, the Supreme Court has been very clear in the past that flag-burning is protected as free speech under the First Amendment. That interpretation of the law is considered so settled by elected officials that efforts to ban flag burning in Congress have taken the form of a proposed constitutional amendment.",
      "And the idea that burning a flag is inherently criminal flies in the face of existing statute regarding Old Glory. Under federal law, burning is the preferred method of disposing of American flags.",
      "Trump no doubt intended to ignite a controversy. His executive order instructs the attorney general to prosecute people who burn flags while committing other crimes \u2014 for the other crimes \u2014 and encourages the Justice Department to test the high court\u2019s standing protection of flag burning.",
      "But what it absolutely does not do is criminalize flag burning or establish a penalty for torching the Stars and Stripes. That would desecrate Article I of the Constitution \u2014 the part that details the powers of Congress.",
      "And some of his Republican allies think that even suggesting a ban \u2014 in the face of the First Amendment \u2014 is playing with fire.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When National Guard troops were deployed here earlier this month, President Donald Trump promised that they would fight crime and make the streets safe again. But in neighborhoods like Columbia Heights, the takeover has created a real sense of terror for immigrants, who say they feel like they are being racially targeted and living in a dystopian version of the city they love.",
      "Immigrants and immigration advocates told NBC News that the federal takeover of the nation\u2019s capital two weeks ago has left vibrant communities and businesses \u201cdeserted.\u201d Both naturalized citizens and those who are in the country illegally said there is a palpable sense of fear now. People are afraid to go grocery shopping, show up to work and go about their daily lives, they said.",
      "Margarita, a 38-year-old mother of four, is an undocumented immigrant who came to the United States from El Salvador. She opened a Latino restaurant earlier this year and said half of her employees are too terrified to come to work.",
      "One employee came in with tears streaming down his face after witnessing an arrest and \u201chow they mistreated people in front of his face,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "Another employee came in \u201ctrembling with fear\u201d and said he felt like federal officers were like \u201ccats out to catch mice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t in good faith tell people to come to work. If something happened to them, that would be on my conscience,\u201d Margarita said. Her business has been \u201cextremely\u201d affected, she added.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a different D.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to see the way the people are traumatized because of what\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "Margarita, along with some others NBC News spoke with, asked not to be identified by their full first and last name or to remain anonymous out of fear of being deported or targeted for speaking out.",
      "They said the city\u2019s landscape has been transformed since Trump announced the federal takeover on Aug. 11 with the goal of fighting crime and ramping up immigration arrests. He has sent more than 2,200 National Guard troops, who now carry firearms, and hundreds more federal agents to Washington. At the time of his announcement, violent crime had decreased 26% compared to last year, according to D.C. police data. Last week, the Justice Department said it was investigating whether Washington police manipulated data to make crime rates appear lower.",
      "A White House official said Tuesday that more than 1,000 total arrests have been made since the National Guard were called in. The official declined to specify how many of those were immigration arrests, but said \u201cless than half of all arrests have involved illegal aliens.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that the focus of the takeover was to \u201cmake D.C. safe and beautiful and to remove public safety threats and violent criminals from our streets.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf federal law enforcement, with the help of the Metropolitan Police Department, come across illegal aliens, of course, we are going to abide by this Administration\u2019s policy of law and order and we are going to remove illegal criminals from our Nation\u2019s capital,\u201d she said.",
      "The administration has highlighted arrests of alleged gang members, or those with a history of being arrested or convicted for violent crimes, including allegations of assault and child sexual abuse.",
      "Washington residents said they have witnessed arrests by groups of what appeared to be immigration agents in the streets. Some said they are increasingly seeing checkpoints where officers are stopping every vehicle and asking drivers for their licenses.",
      "Granados, a naturalized American citizen originally from El Salvador who has lived in the U.S. for about 40 years, said in Spanish that he and many other Latinos feel that \u201cthere\u2019s been racial profiling here against us. Our people are hidden because of fear.\u201d He asked that his full name not be used out of fear he could be targeted even though he is a citizen.",
      "Granados said he was walking in the center of Columbia Heights, where there is a large immigrant community, when he saw federal agents \u201cgrab two men, they were tying them up as I passed by and they pushed them and threw them into a car and left.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep, I felt terrible,\u201d he said, his voice welling with emotion.",
      "He said he personally knows people who worked in his industry, remodeling, who have been arrested. \u201cThey\u2019re people who haven\u2019t done anything. They mistreat you without knowing who you are,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration has denied claims of racial profiling in its immigration arrests.",
      "\u201cAny claims that individuals have been \u2018targeted\u2019 by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target of ICE is that they are in our country illegally \u2014 not their skin color. These types of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement,\u201d Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News this month.",
      "Amy Fisher, a core organizer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid network in Washington, D.C., said the group has been ramping up deliveries to immigrants of essentials such as \u201cfood and diapers and other things they can\u2019t buy because they\u2019re not going to work and struggling to make ends meet, and others are too afraid to go to the grocery store.\u201d",
      "The group has also seen an \u201cexponential\u201d increase in calls to its hotline, where people can report immigration enforcement actions that are then relayed to the community.",
      "\u201cThe hotline is just sort of ringing off the hook,\u201d Fisher said. Previously it would get a few dozen calls a week, but after the takeover it received 500 calls from Monday to Friday during the first week of the federal takeover.",
      "Employees and owners of businesses in Columbia Heights told NBC News the federal takeover has left their businesses hurting as workers and customers alike have disappeared.",
      "Genesis Quintero Lemus, 20, a green card holder from El Salvador who is a fruit vendor alongside her mother, said people are weighing the risk of remaining open.",
      "\u201cA lot of us can\u2019t really afford staying home, because this is our only livelihood,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of the workers, and I know they\u2019re hard-working people who are just there to provide for their families.\u201d",
      "People have also been scared because of recent immigration raids and arrests nearby, including at a Latino grocery store, Quintero Lemus said.",
      "\u201cWho are they targeting? To me, it seems that they\u2019re racial profiling,\u201d said a bakery employee in Columbia Heights who is a naturalized citizen from El Salvador.",
      "She said business is down and employers are cutting work hours because of the decrease in customers. The constant presence of federal law enforcement has also made people afraid to be out in the street, she added.",
      "\u201cHaving them here doesn\u2019t make me feel safe. I don\u2019t feel safe at all,\u201d said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous even though she is a citizen out of fear she could be targeted for speaking out.",
      "\u201cI get scared that just because of my complexion, I\u2019m going to be taken, and I am a U.S. citizen,\u201d she said.",
      "Aris Compres, the owner of a Dominican restaurant in the area, also said the takeover has been \u201cterrible for business.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments about allowing hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students into the United States have drawn criticism from some of the most outspoken members of the Republican Party.",
      "Ahead of his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House on Monday, Trump told reporters that he plans to allow 600,000 Chinese students into the country \u2014 a figure more than double the number in the United States now.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get along good with China. I hear so many stories about \u2018We\u2019re not going to allow their students\u2019\u201d to come in, Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow, it\u2019s very important, 600,000 students. It\u2019s very important.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a sharp departure from an announcement Secretary of State Marco Rubio made in May, when he promised the United States would \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas for Chinese students and add more scrutiny to all future visa applications from China.",
      "While Trump stressed the United States\u2019 \u201cimportant\u201d relationship with the country, other high-profile members of his party disagreed. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., railed against the idea on social media.",
      "\u201cWhy are we allowing 600,000 students from China to replace our American student\u2019s opportunities?\u201d Greene wrote on X. \u201cWe should never allow that.\u201d",
      "Far-right influencer and twice failed Republican congressional candidate Laura Loomer also blasted the idea, labeling Chinese students as \u201cCommunist spies.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody, I repeat nobody, wants 600,000 more Chinese \u2018students\u2019 aka Communist spies in the United States,\u201d Loomer wrote on X.",
      "Neither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 questions about the shift in policy or criticisms from the members of the GOP.",
      "On the Fox News show \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick fielded criticism from host Laura Ingraham that Trump\u2019s comments run counter to his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, saying the move was an economic one.",
      "\u201cWell, the president\u2019s point of view is that what would happen if you didn\u2019t have those 600,000 students is that you\u2019d empty them from the top, all the students would go up to better schools, and the bottom 15% of universities and colleges would go out of business in America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "There were an estimated 277,398 Chinese international students studying in the United States during the 2023-24 school year. Together with students from India, the group makes up more than half of the international students in the country. In 2023 alone, Chinese students contributed upward of $14 billion to the American economy.",
      "But Republican lawmakers have long attempted to stem the flow of Chinese students into the United States. In March, Republican congressmen introduced the Stop CCP VISAs Act, which would halt the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationals looking to study at American universities or take part in exchange programs. The bill drew widespread backlash from activists, schools and others, including Chinese students, who called the legislation the \u201cnew Chinese Exclusion Act.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just blatant racism and xenophobia,\u201d a Chinese student who recently graduated from a Washington, D.C.-area university previously told NBC News. The student requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cWe are not spies. We are students who want to get a better education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s latest comments on students come as tensions between the United States and China have eased slightly from earlier this year when both countries threatened high tariffs. Talks have continued and tariff rates have cooled as a 90-day trade truce, established in May, was extended through November.",
      "Trump told reporters that it is a \u201cmuch better relationship economically than it was before with Biden.\u201d However, on Monday he also threatened to impose 200% tariffs on China if the country does not export rare earth magnets to the United States."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration directed 40 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., to remove references to transgender people from their sex education programs or risk losing federal funding.",
      "The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, sent letters Tuesday demanding that the health departments in these states and territories remove \u201call references to gender ideology\u201d from their Personal Responsibility Education Program, or PREP. The program is a federally funded initiative created in 2010 to help prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",
      "\u201cAccountability is coming,\u201d acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison said in a statement. \u201cFederal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas. The Trump Administration will ensure that PREP reflects the intent of Congress, not the priorities of the left.\u201d",
      "The 40 states that received letters are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  The five U.S. territories are: Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Links to all 46 letters were included in the administration\u2019s press statement. The ACF\u2019s four-page letter to New York, for example, includes a bulleted list of course content that was flagged during a \u201cmedical accuracy review\u201d earlier this year and \u201cmust be removed from New York\u2019s PREP curricula and program materials.\u201d",
      "The content flagged for removal includes definitions of gender identity and gender expression and directives that program facilitators allow students to share their pronouns and \u201cdemonstrate acceptance and respect for all participants, regardless of personal characteristics, including race, cultural background, religion, social class, sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d according to the letter.",
      "If New York\u2019s health department declines to comply, it could lose more than $6 million in federal funds, according to data provided by ACF. The other states and territories stand to lose $300,000 to $4.6 million each.",
      "The letters come just days after the ACF terminated $12 million of California\u2019s remaining PREP funding after the state\u2019s health department declined to remove references to trans people from the curriculum, arguing that the references had already been approved by the agency, the materials were medically accurate and relevant to the statute, and ACF does not have the authority to take such an enforcement action, according to ACF\u2019s termination letter to the state.",
      "California\u2019s health department has 30 days to appeal. A spokesperson for the department said in a statement that the state maintains its position that its PREP curriculum \u201cis medically accurate, comprehensive, and age-appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cCA PREP sexual health education curriculum promotes healthy relationships and reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, as well as leads to delayed sexual activity in youth \u2014 all outcomes that lead to a healthier state,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "In an emailed statement, Elana Ross, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in y, President Trump is attacking kids\u2019 safety, health, and access to education as part of his culture war.\u201d",
      "The action from ACF is part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing effort to prohibit federal recognition of trans people and penalize the use of federal funds for any program that includes or mentions them.",
      "In the first few weeks of his presidency, Trump issued executive orders declaring that there are only two unchangeable sexes; prohibiting trans people from enlisting and serving in the military; barring trans girls and women from competing on female sports teams in federally funded K-12 schools and colleges; and barring federal funding from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors. The federal government has taken several actions against providers of transition care, resulting in more than 20 hospitals over the last few months rolling back or ending their gender-affirming care programs for minors and some young adults.",
      "Federal officials have also removed mentions of trans or intersex people from agency websites, including from the website for the Stonewall National Monument commemorating the site of the 1969 Stonewall uprising in New York, which is widely considered a turning point in the modern gay rights movement."

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged after two years of dating, and she has the ring to prove it.",
      "Swift posted a series of engagement photos on Aug. 26. Slide 3 of the carousel is a close-up of the diamond ring itself.",
      "The old mine diamond is set in a ring designed by Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry, TODAY.com can confirm. The diamond is a brilliant cushion cut.",
      "Old mine cuts are notable because they are antique diamonds dating back to the time that diamonds were hand-cut and polished. Jeweler Hannah Florman tells TODAY.com old mine diamonds \"send a signal that the wearer values individuality over mass-produced perfection,\" since each is cut by hand.",
      "\"This ring honors craftsmanship and subtle beauty that\u2019s not about trends,\" Florman says.",
      "Jewelry specialist Laura Taylor says old mine cuts are a \"hallmark of antique jewelry,\" and are known for \"having a romantic glow rather than the sparkle we associate with engagement rings today.\"",
      "The vintage look is underlined by the ring\u2019s thick gold cigar band, an increasingly popular choice for rings. Dua Lipa's engagement ring, for example, has this type of band.",
      "But Florman says the detailing on Swift's ring gives it a \"different look than the trending rings we're seeing right now.\" The engraved band gives it a \"real storybook quality,\" Taylor says.",
      "Plus, the diamond has both prongs and a button-back setting \u2014 essentially, a layer of metal surrounding the stone itself, which is another hallmark of older rings.",
      "\"As a self-proclaimed \u2018English teacher\u2019 and lover of art and history, it\u2019s not surprising to see Travis select an antique ring similar to that of the Victorian era. This ring style feels reminiscent of a bygone era tied to the 18th and 19th centuries when diamonds were cut by candlelight,\" Florman says.",
      "Simone Kendle, CEO of Wove Made Inc., the jewelry brand behind the viral TNT bracelet Swift and Kelce once wore, agrees that the vintage feel mirrors Swift's aesthetic and value as an artist.",
      "\"It\u2019s not trendy or flashy; it\u2019s rooted in history and romance, which is very her,\" Kendle says.",
      "She says the thick band adds to an \"old-money vibe\" and the feeling the ring is a \"vintage heirloom.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not about following current trends, it\u2019s about leaning into heritage,\" Kendle says.",
      "In terms of the diamond\u2019s carat size and pricing, the jewelers give a range of estimates.",
      "Florman estimates the ring is 8 carats and between $500,000 to $1 million.",
      "Kendle says it could be between 7 and 8 carats. \"A diamond of that size and character would be valued in the millions, depending on its color and clarity \u2014 it\u2019s truly one of a kind,\" she says."

      "\u201cPrior to the show ending, I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I could audition for DCC, because I don\u2019t want to be cut on TV,\u2019\u201d Waller tells TODAY.com.",
      "So, when she arrived for her first DCC audition in 2024, what surprised her wasn't the toil \u2014 but the cameras. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d the Netflix series following the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders from auditions through the season, was filming its second season.",
      "\u201cI go into auditions and turns out, there\u2019s a Netflix show,\u201d she laughs, explaining that the series\u2019 first season hadn\u2019t been released yet.",

      "Chatting with TODAY.com, Waller says the \u201coverwhelming\u201d moment she learned she made the team was \u201cthe most joy I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like I was watching my whole life in pictures. As soon as Charlotte announced the team, it felt like everything I had been working for my whole life just built up into that moment,\u201d Waller continues, referring to Charlotte Jones, executive vice president of the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Below, Waller opens up about her path to this moment.",
      "What's DCC Training Camp Like? 'Scarier' Than It Seems",
      "The San Diego, California, native first auditioned for the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders in 2024. She made it through the initial rounds of tryouts and claimed a coveted spot at training camp in Dallas, Texas. At training camp, cuts are made to arrive at about 36 team members.",
      "\u201cPeople always ask me, \u2018Is it as scary as it seems? And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s worse. It\u2019s scarier. There\u2019s more pressure,\u2019\u201d Waller says of training camp.",
      "Recalling her state of mind going into training camp last year, Waller calls herself a \u201chead case.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so in my head, just constantly in this state of anxiety,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd then I think it just set me up to not be as successful. I couldn\u2019t get out of my head.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I was always not good enough,\u201d she adds. \u201cNot that they were telling me that, but I just felt that way throughout the whole training camp.\u201d",
      "Waller says she \u201cwasn\u2019t performing my best\u201d due to \u201cnerves and emotions\u201d her first time around, and was let go as the final women on the DCC roster were being selected.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2 captures the conversation DCC director Kelli Finglass broke the news to Waller.",
      "\u201cWhen I was cut, there was a moment, I think she rhetorically asked me, like, \u2018Who else? There was no one else to cut.\u2019 And I 100% agreed with that. Everybody is amazing. There\u2019s nobody else to cut,\u201d she says.",
      "Describing herself as having a \u201cgrowth mindset,\u201d Waller says she \u201cwould never assume that I\u2019m good enough to never have to improve.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, immediately I told Kelly in that moment I\u2019d be back next year,\u201d she continues.",
      "But she did have a limit: Waller says she would only audition twice. \u201cTo put yourself through that three times and set yourself up for potential heartbreak is really hard,\u201d she says.",
      "How She Prepared for Round 2",
      "Waller considered not following through with her second audition, \u201cjust because I was going through so much mentally and emotionally.\u201d But she was bolstered by her family, friends and the women with whom she became \u201cso close\u201d while auditioning.",
      "\u201cThey just take you in. They help you through the whole training camp,\u201d she says of the veterans on the team. \u201cI think it\u2019s because they know how hard it is on you as a rookie that you just form these deep bonds.\u201d",
      "For year two, she took a more targeted approach. While Waller had been dancing since she was 2 and had performed at the collegiate level, her DCC prep amounted to just a few specific classes the first time around.",
      "\u201cThis year, I joined Jennifer Amburn\u2019s pro focus program,\u201d Waller says, referring to the DCC alum who started classes to prepare dancers for NFL and professional teams. Waller trained with Amburn twice a week \u2014 once privately, and once in classes \u2014 then did a separate DCC prep class.",
      "The result? A completely different audition process.",
      "\u201cI was pleasantly surprised that I felt a lot more calm going into this training camp,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt at peace through the whole process this year.\u201d",
      "The feeling of peace without such heightened nerves allowed her to \u201cperform so much better,\u201d Waller adds.",
      "\u201cI remember waking up finals day \u2014 and finals day is scary because it\u2019s a solo. It feels very audition-y \u2014 whereas training camp feels more like practice,\u201d Waller explains. \u201cI woke up finals day expecting to be all nerves, stomach in a knot, and it was just none of that. I felt so at peace and so excited and just happy to be there for the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Once at training camp, Waller says she had the epiphany that there were simply \u201chealthy nerves\u201d she\u2019d learn to live with.",
      "\u201cThis is never actually going to go away. Practice is scary. This team has so much pressure. There\u2019s a certain amount of nerves that are just natural and they\u2019re going to be there,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd of course, there is the pressure of being cut, but I didn\u2019t feel like my life was going to end whether I did or didn\u2019t make the team, and I think that helped me a lot,\u201d Waller adds.",
      "Gearing Up for Her 1st 'Thunderstruck'",
      "While Waller can't reveal whether auditions were taped or if \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 3 is confirmed, she says \u201clittle things\u201d changed this year compared to what was shown in Season 2 of the docuseries.",
      "For example, Waller says cuts happened \u201ca little bit earlier on this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like last year the cuts seemed really scary because they didn\u2019t happen until, I want to say, Week 3. So it was this built up anxiety,\u201d she says, later adding, \u201cThis year, the first cut happened a little bit earlier. So I do believe that the faster the cuts happen, the better.\u201d",
      "Now, the athletes have entered the NFL football season. The Cowboys are already in their preseason, with their first regular season home game on the books Sept. 14 against the New York Giants.",
      "Preparing for the upcoming season, Waller says the squad has practice every day, when they learn the rest of the routines and \u201cgame elements\u201d not taught during training camp.",
      "While Waller says being a collegiate cheerleader helped her, nothing can prepare her for how being on the Cowboys field will feel.",
      "With the first game on the horizon, Waller says she\u2019s both \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d for her first \u201cThunderstruck\u201d performance, the DCC\u2019s iconic dance routine that opens every Cowboys game at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI am nervous for \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019 just because you need to have such high stamina, and it requires such endurance, so that part is scary,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m excited. And now doing \u2018Thunderstruck,\u2019 I feel so proud to be doing it, whereas before I was scared.\u201d"

      "\"KPop Demon Hunters,\" an animated Netflix movie about a girl group who slays audiences onstage and demons offstage, is packed with songs so infectious that even dads are powerless to resist.",
      "\u201cThis movie is the perfect combo of nostalgia, earworms and never-ending streaming. So we\u2019re screwed,\u201d father, singer and comedian Chris Mann jokes with TODAY.com.",
      "On Aug. 4, Mann posted a TikTok illustrating his growing obsession with the movie. Featuring the song \u201cGolden,\u201d the video has been viewed about 10 million times. It shows Mann going from mild interest on first watch to dramatically singing into a sword on his 10th watch.",
      "\"This is the pop culture moment of the year,\" he says. \"It has broken the internet.\"",
      "The movie has even infiltrated TODAY host Craig Melvin\u2019s household.",
      "\u201cWe watched it this weekend,\u201d joked Craig on Aug. 25. \u201cThe singalong version? They\u2019re not even giving us a chance now.\u201d",
      "The movie may have been initially available only on Netflix, but over the weekend it transferred to physical movie theaters, where it made about $20 million. Six songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack have taken over Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart, with two rising into the top 10 slots, according to Billboard\u2019s website. On Aug. 25, Netflix released a special sing-along edition on its streaming platform.",
      "The fervor doesn't seem to be slowing down.",
      "Mann had been watching the movie on repeat at home with his kids, but he still forked over the money to watch it in the theater with them this weekend.",
      "\"Everybody went. The whole school went,\" he explains. \"It's almost like the school version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where you don't want to miss out.\"",
      "The movie has similarly been \u201cblowing up\u201d teacher Rob D\u2019Urbano\u2019s parent group chat. \u201cHonestly, none of us mind that it\u2019s on repeat in our houses,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI feel like all the dads are enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Alongside a TikTok video of himself watching the movie even after his three young daughters went to bed, he wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only parent that bops to this movie.\u201d",
      "No, sir. You certainly are not.",
      "Influencer Josh Jones made a TikTok video similar to Mann's showing his evolution from skeptic to believer. He added costumes, wigs and a dance routine to really show his dedication to the film.",
      "For Jones, it's the \"message behind the movie\" that really resonates.",
      "\"There's this really positive message here, where it perfectly portrays the battle between good and evil,\" he says. In fact, he allows the kids to watch the movie on Sunday, a day that he and his wife normally reserve for \"religious\" movies. He says, \"It's complimented our spiritual journey as a family very nicely.\"",
      "As the father of one son and five daughters \u2014 with another daughter on the way \u2014 Jones also appreciates the \"girl power\" theme of the movie. \"Having all of these daughters, that's something that I just really want to support,\" he shares.",
      "The phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to girl dads.",
      "Mann's two sons also love the movie. His 4-year-old sings \"Soda Pop\" and his 8-year-old is trying to teach himself to play the song on the piano by ear. Mann, an actor who played the title role in the the Broadway tour of \"Phantom of the Opera\" for 700 performances, does a mean version of \"Golden.\"",
      "\u201cSomething about these competing boy and girl groups is super nostalgic for millennial parents,\" Mann says. \"We get to relive this fandom all over again through our kids. It\u2019s like our boy band DNA meeting parenting reality.\u201d",
      "Mann adds, \"This Halloween, it's going to be only 'KPop Demon Hunters.' I wish I had stock in this movie.\""

      "At the time, the Pakistan native shared a carousel of photos on Instagram and penned a powerful message about how \"music no longer plays on the streets, and girls and women are barred from school, work and public life\" after the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cOne day I hope we will live in a world where every girl will be able to enjoy music and live out her wildest dreams,\u201d she wrote.",

      "It may not be happily ever after for our \"Love Island USA\" Season 7 winners Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales.",
      "They emerged victorious from the Fiji villa, winning over America, each other and the $100,000 cash prize. They left the villa as a couple.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com soon after the finale, Bryan emphasized their relationship's authenticity: \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m so happy to be here with her. Trust me, it\u2019s real.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also a bad actress and a bad liar \u2014 I think people would be able to catch on quickly,\u201d Amaya chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m like, I need Botox after this, he makes me smile this much.\u201d",
      "Since then, though, the couple has been dogged by persistent breakup rumors that reached a fever pitch this week.",
      "Ahead of the \"Love Island USA\" Season 7 Reunion, both Amaya and Bryan have unfollowed each other on Instagram, adding fuel to split speculation that first surfaced earlier this summer.",
      "The rumors began swirling when Bryan was allegedly spotted  with another woman at a nightclub just days after the couple left the villa together.",
      "At the time, the pair seemed to shut down the chatter with a romantic TikTok posted to Bryan\u2019s account. \u201cWhen everyone thinks you\u2019re over meanwhile this is us,\u201d read the caption, accompanying footage of the couple gazing into each other\u2019s eyes before Amaya leaped into Bryan\u2019s arms.",
      "Based on the reunion trailer, Bryan will address the rumors. Here's what to know.",
      "What happened between Amaya and Bryan on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",
      "Austin admitted to writing the card, explaining that after they initially coupled up, \u201cthe intensity of your emotions and feelings and wants just felt like they built way up.\u201d",
      "Ace and Zak decided to join Austin and gang up on Amaya in front of everyone. But what could have been Amaya\u2019s lowest point in the villa actually became a silver lining, as this is where her and Bryan\u2019s story began.",
      "\u201cOne thing I got to add though,\u201d Bryan interjected that night. \u201cComing from a Hispanic household, calling someone \u2018Babe,\u2019 \u2018Mi amor,\u2019 \u2018Mi vida,\u2019 that\u2019s just how we talk. You\u2019re telling her meet you halfway, you got to meet her halfway, too.\u201d",
      "The following day, Amaya and Bryan had a chat and started to get to know one another. Bryan not only understood Amaya, but he loved the way she expressed herself.",
      "The pair coupled up on Episode 30, and America eventually voted to send them to the Season 7 finale. Viewers got to see their final date and declarations of love, the loving speeches all the final couples give to one another right before the winners are announced.",
      "During their first and final date, Amaya expressed her appreciation for Bryan, especially for how he spoke on her behalf during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge.",
      "\u201cBabe, you don\u2019t understand how much it meant, that moment, like of you standing up for me in the Stand on Business,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, like, if my light is too bright for somebody, wear sunglasses or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",
      "Bryan \u201cpopped the question,\u201d as Amaya put it in her confessional later in the episode, to continue dating exclusively each other when they leave Fiji.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to talk to you and just basically let you know how much I care about you and how much you mean to me here,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd I love your energy, I love when you get the zoomies ... Just making everybody\u2019s day better. Fine as hell ... I definitely wanted to leave here letting you know that I want to make stuff exclusive with us and prioritize us. I want to continue taking the right steps with you and attacking the outside world with you.\u201d",
      "Are Amaya and Bryan still together now?",
      "The couple publicly confirmed their exclusive relationship after leaving the villa and during a recent profile with TODAY.com. Amaya said she visited Bryan's family in Boston.",
      "\u201cI had such a great time, met his mom \u2014 it was just very wholesome,\u201d Amaya said.",
      "But their decision to unfollow each other on Instagram signals serious trouble in paradise.",
      "Adding to the breakup speculation, Amaya reposted a cryptic TikTok video the same day fans noticed the social media snub.",
      "The video says, \"How it feels when you know you have to leave him alone,\" over pictures of  girls crying, alone, or looking forlornly. The caption features a few hashtags, including \"#ex,\" \"#sad,\" and \"#imissyou.\""

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/love-island-mental-health-effects-psychologist-rcna220785",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:58:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

    "story": [
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" is now a Netflix phenomenon, a star-studded series about southern housewives behaving badly \u2014\u00a0and they're packing more than booze and gossip.",
      "But it all began with a story author May Cobb's mother told her once, while they were driving down the blacktop roads of Longview, her Texas hometown. Cobb's eventual 2021 novel, \"The Hunting Wives,\" went on to inspire the series, first produced for Starz.",
      "\"My mom is such a good storyteller. She started telling me how in high school some of the rich boys would invite her to something called 'the hunting party,'\" Cobb says, speaking to TODAY.com. \"Basically, they would go out to the roofs of their giant cars and try to shoot small game.\"",
      "Cobb, hearing the story, immediately thought of everything that could go wrong with the scenario, and there was a lot. Then it clicked: She wanted to write a novel about it.",
      "\"But I want to swap out the rich boys for women. I want to subvert to 'Texas boys club' and let the women behave badly for a change,\" she remembers thinking.",
      "It's the story of Sophie (Brittany Snow in the series), a Texas transplant who becomes enmeshed in a dynamic friend group in her new town. When a teenage girl winds up dead, they're implicated, although the ending in Cobb's novel is different.",
      "Cobb set the story in a town like the one she grew up in, two hours east of Dallas, in a part of Texas close to the Louisiana border. She describes it as \"eerily beautiful noir,\" a place where Spanish moss hangs from trees and everyone knows everyone's name and history.",
      "She calls the character of Margo, portrayed by Malin \u00c5kerman in the show, a risk-taking and boundary-pushing woman whom Sophie befriends, an \"archetypal east Texas woman\" in the book, but also in the show.",
      "\"It's a party town. The people from my town are high-spirited and fun. I remember one of my editor's notes was, 'Do people drink this much?' And I said, 'I actually toned it down,'\" she says, laughing.",
      "She wanted the book to feel like a \"train wreck\" and a \"downward spiral.\" She was writing when her son was a little kid, and since she was no longer going out for ladies' nights, put the feeling of nights out in the book.",
      "\"I think I went a little too far, but it was so much fun to, like, skew that moral compass and not have to worry about it at all,\" she says.",
      "Cobb stands by her book's morally gray female characters, who party until the late hours and have affairs with high schoolers \u2014 and each other.",
      "\u201cI got a fair amount of backlash when the book came out, and I was honestly shocked. I was like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s not why I read novels. I read them to escape, to go on an adventure, and I love a good train wreck,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like, \u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny. Nobody ever got mad at the women being murderers. They were mad about the misbehaving,\u201d she says.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/greater-israel-palestinian-capital-tiny-strip-land-divide-west-bank-rcna226955",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 08:00:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Israel has approved a settlement in the occupied West Bank that would cut the territory in two, and could destroy hopes for a future Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is signaling fresh doubts about whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet anytime soon as momentum toward a summit between the warring countries appears to be fading.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll meet \u2014 maybe they will, maybe they won\u2019t,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House during a meeting in the Oval Office with South Korean leader Lee Jae-myung. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to them. It takes two to tango. I always say it. And they should meet, I think, before I have a meeting and probably close the deal, but I think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",
      "Trump praised Putin for traveling to the United States for talks, a move he said Putin was reluctant to make, but he acknowledged that the efforts to broker peace seem to have slowed.",
      "That marks a shift in tone just over a week after Trump hosted Putin in Alaska for a whirlwind summit aimed at breaking through the three-year stalemate in the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump had initially suggested that back-to-back meetings between the key parties could occur within a matter of days or weeks.",
      "But he conceded Monday that organizing the meetings has proven more challenging than he anticipated and described the fight as \u201cpersonal\u201d for both leaders and rooted in deep animosity.",
      "Underscoring the dynamic, two Russian cruise missiles last week hit a U.S. electronics factory in Ukraine, a sign that Moscow remains committed to the fight even as Washington calls for an end to the bloodshed.",
      "Even so, Trump struck an optimistic note, saying he believes \"we\u2019re gonna get that war straightened out,\" and he also warned that there \u201ccould be very big consequences\u201d if Putin and Zelenskyy fail to meet soon.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens over the next week or two,\u201d he said, extending the timelines and adding that he would be prepared to \u201cstep in very strongly\u201d if progress stalls.",
      "On security guarantees, Trump said earlier in the day that the United States would support European efforts to secure Ukraine but emphasized that Europe would undertake the most \u201csignificant\u201d commitments. \u201cThey\u2019re right there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll back it up, because I want to stop seeing people being killed.\u201d",
      "Trump's summit with Putin on Aug. 15 ended abruptly with a planned lunch pulled from the schedule and no ceasefire deal, but Trump signaled progress, calling it \u201cproductive.\" Zelenskyy and European leaders rushed to the White House for a high-level meeting after the summit with Putin. At the time, the White House touted the urgency of the moment, noting that \u201cevery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later\u201d to join the talks.",
      "During that meeting, Trump stepped out to call Putin and later said on Truth Social that he had begun \u201cthe arrangements for a meeting\u201d between Zelenskyy and Putin, after which they would have a trilateral meeting involving Trump himself. Kremlin officials downplayed the idea, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov casting doubt over the future of the peace push in an interview Friday with NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" There was no such meeting on the calendar, Lavrov said, adding that key issues, including territorial disputes and security guarantees for Ukraine, remain unresolved.",
      "By the end of the week, Trump\u2019s frustration appeared to be mounting. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about anything about that war. Nothing. Not happy at all,\u201d he said Friday, warning that \u201cthe next two weeks\u201d could be pivotal.",
      "Asked what would happen at the end of those two weeks, Trump said he would weigh \u201cmassive sanctions or massive tariffs or both. Or do we do nothing and say it\u2019s your fight.\u201d"

      "Australia on Tuesday accused Iran of directing at least two antisemitic attacks in the country, expelling the Iranian ambassador to Canberra in response.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency had \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d that Iran was behind two attacks on Jewish sites in Melbourne and Sydney last year, part of a series of what Albanese called \u201cappalling\u201d acts of antisemitism in the country since the Israel-Hamas war began almost two years ago.",
      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",
      "\u201cThey were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable, and the Australian government is taking strong and decisive action in response.\u201d",

The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",

Netanyahu responded by calling Albanese \u201ca weak politician who betrayed Israel,\u201d saying his political record had been \u201ctarnished forever.\u201d",

      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",
      "A report from the Agriculture Department last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion in livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 One of the United States\u2019 strongest allies in Asia, South Korea, has had a rough start with President Donald Trump \u2014 struggling in tariff talks as it spent months without a permanent leader.",
      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to him: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes building U.S. shipyards, training shipbuilding personnel and maintaining U.S. Navy ships.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security were high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which came amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before the meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and that they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the United States, said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she said in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the United States and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before he headed to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since he was elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters that he had asked Ishiba for details about Japan\u2019s negotiations with the United States and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the United States against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The United States and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",
      "\u201cMASGA cannot cover everything for President Lee in dealing with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that the State Department stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel, such as Australia and Canada, have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that the move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That is about 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner said that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively to protect them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the United States and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",

      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures.

      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",
      "\u201cHell yes,\u201d Yeoh said in response, calling the movie \u201ca beautiful way\u201d to cross the cultural bridge between East and West.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal language of family, of love, of the underdog, of someone who\u2019s ostracized, misunderstood just because you\u2019re born different,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",
      "The success of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d is driven by both the maturation of China\u2019s animation industry and authorities\u2019 \u201cfull support\u201d for strengthening the country\u2019s soft power and cultural exports, said Zeng Hong, assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

    "story": [
      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Researchers said the report was based on interviews with defectors and officials around the world, as well as declassified documents, satellite images and open-source information.",
      "The report said the weapons at the base could include North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMs or a missile that has yet to be revealed.",
      "\u201cCurrent assessments are that during times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites.\u201d",
      "According to the latest estimate from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea has assembled about 50 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.",
      "Construction of the Sinpung-dong base began around 2004, and it was \u201cgenerally complete and operational\u201d by 2014, the report said. Satellite images suggest the base continues to be developed and \u201cis active and being well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d it said.",
      "It is one of about 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and related facilities across the country that North Korea has never declared, the report said.",
      "Since denuclearization talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in 2019, North Korea has been steadily advancing its weapons programs in defiance of international sanctions.",
      "It has also strengthened security ties with Russia, including sending arms and troops to fight in its war against Ukraine in exchange for support that experts say could include technological assistance with its weapons programs.",
      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "On Monday, Kim called for a rapid nuclear buildup amid annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises that Pyongyang sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Though Trump has expressed an interest in resuming in-person diplomacy with Kim, his regime has dismissed the idea and says the United States must accept North Korea as a nuclear power."
