      "Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny\u2019s music catalog has seen a jump in streams since his 2026 Super Bowl halftime performance was announced last week",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny's music catalog has seen a jump in streams since his 2026 Super Bowl halftime performance was announced.",
      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \u201cdone and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",

Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",

The pastor of the church attended by Manchester, Ron Smith, plays a pawnshop owner. Dunst is interrogated by the police officers who actually interviewed Wainscott.",

      "Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri did not expect some of the discourse around \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Andrew Garfield would like everyone to know about his gesticulating. Not in his performance as a Yale philosophy professor accused of sexual misconduct in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but while discussing an actor\u2019s responsibility to comment on the work they\u2019re putting out in the world.",
      "It\u2019s a blue-sky day outside the luxurious Hotel Cipriani and Garfield is seated alongside his co-stars Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri discussing a film that has, for better or worse, become the topic of some spirited debates. Just a few days prior at the Venice Film Festival, journalists at a press conference asked Roberts and filmmaker Luca Guadagnino if the film undermines the feminist movement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",
      "Roberts chimed in: \u201cThe hair as well.\u201d (It was bouncing).",
      "With \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d in theaters Friday, Guadagnino and his actors knew they were making something thorny, something challenging, about messy, imperfect people whose lives, and lies, are upended with the accusation. They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",
      "Roberts was particularly fascinated by Alma\u2019s relationship with her husband, Frederik, a shrink played by Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg, whose unexpected choices had her in awe.",
      "\u201cI did catch myself watching him a couple of times instead of being in the scene and I was just like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s so (expletive) good,\u2019\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd then I think, \u2018Oh, I have a line.\u2019\u201d",

Garfield, who Guadagnino has been trying to work with for almost 20 years, had to do one of his most emotional scenes on his first day.

      "\u201cI thought a lot about films that have been able to resist the pressure of time and to become some insightful classics,\u201d Guadagnino said.",
      "Perhaps the most inscrutable of the bunch is Maggie. Even Edebiri said she had some trouble wrapping her head around her motivations and actions.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a tricky girl,\u201d Edebiri said. \u201cA word Luca kept using a lot in conversations was displacement. Maggie\u2019s such a displaced person psychologically, but also as a transracial adoptee, and occupying this space full of these professors who are performing.\u201d",
      "But the point for all are the questions, not the answers, and \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is not a film that wraps anything up in a tidy morality. Those conversations are for the audience to have.",
      "\u201cThere are very few filmmakers who are alive for whom the priority is radical, vulnerable, unbridled self-expression and exploration and curiosity rather than something didactic,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cThe conversation is the thing, I think, that\u2019s the most we can ever dream of, that people will be confronted by their own response. The film hopefully is a mirror for every person watching, and then they can compare reflections with each other.\"",

      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",

      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions.

      "A search warrant for the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d actor's property was issued alongside the arrest warrant days after the Sept. 18 incident, when the dogs attacked a small spaniel owned by a neighbor about a half a mile away from Gibson's house. The dog was rushed to a veterinary hospital, but did not survive, Dwyer said.",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e?

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

      "KAJIADO, Kenya -- KAJIADO, Kenya (AP) \u2014 This year, less than a kilometer from where I live, a girl named Peace Mwende was killed by a lion. The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",

      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away. Only its head was visible.",

He lived in our compound; he had helped to build our house and to plant many of the trees that now form the indigenous forest that surrounds our home.",

      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "Grisham, who is writing a book about the case, said Roberson's trial \u201cwas grossly unfair\u201d because his autism contributed to people believing he was guilty and his defense lawyers told jurors it was a case of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson said he remains optimistic he will one day get a chance to prove his innocence with a new trial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scared to die, but I\u2019m not ready to die, you know. I would like to believe God has more for me to do and stuff, you know,\u201d Roberson said.",

Planned Parenthood officials argue that the state's restrictions violate an amendment to the Missouri Constitution narrowly approved by voters in November to protect abortion rights.",
      "The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office issued subpoenas starting in late August to two employees of the Kansas City Planned Parenthood affiliate, a physician contracting with it, and two former board members of the St. Louis-area Planned Parenthood affiliate, according to Planned Parenthood court filings last month.

But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",
      "There are some Republicans in Congress who want to extend the higher subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people who receive their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to receive notices that their premiums will increase at the beginning of the year. But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans govern by poll and fail to grab this moment, they will own it,\u201d wrote Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican, in a letter published in the The Wall Street Journal over the weekend. He encouraged senators not to go \u201cwobbly\u201d on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe jig is up, the pandemic is over and my colleagues shouldn\u2019t blink in any other direction,\u201d Roy wrote.",
      "Republicans have been railing against the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, since it was enacted 15 years ago. But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly indicated that Republicans are open to extending the subsidies, with reforms, if Democrats would reopen the government. But he has refused to negotiate until that happens \u2014 and has suggested Trump will be key to the eventual outcome.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday \u201cthere may be a path forward\u201d on ACA subsidies, but stressed, \u201cI think a lot of it would come down to where the White House lands on that.\u201d",
      "Many GOP senators argue the only path forward is to overhaul the law. \u201cThe whole problem with all of this is Obamacare,\u201d said Florida Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "Most House Republicans agree, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has been noncommittal on discussions.",
      "\u201cObamacare is not working,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to fix it.\u201d",

Mike Rounds of South Dakota has suggested extending the subsidies for a year and then phasing them out. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has suggested pushing ahead with a group of bipartisan spending bills that are pending and a commitment to discuss the health care issue.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

The group also represented a Christian website designer who doesn\u2019t want to work with same-sex couples and successfully challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law in 2023.",
      "The group's argument in the conversion therapy case also builds on another victory from 2018: A Supreme Court decision found California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",
      "The high court agreed to hear the case after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the law. Another appeals court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has struck down similar bans in Florida.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 116 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",

      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration.

      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",

      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",

So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "The court in Buenos Aires also sentenced the man's accomplice to eight years in prison, capping a dramatic case that has convulsed and captivated the country since the botched assassination attempt on Sept. 1, 2022, when the main defendant, Fernando Sabag Montiel, squeezed through a crowd outside the ex-president's home, thrust a loaded gun at her face and pulled the trigger.",

      "Among Latin America\u2019s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentine politics and two terms as president (2007-2015), Fern\u00e1ndez is a deeply polarizing figure whose brand of left-wing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits.",
      "Convicted of corruption for allegedly steering public roadworks contracts to a friend's company, Fern\u00e1ndez, 72, was sentenced earlier this year to six years behind bars. Citing her advanced age and safety fears since the 2022 attack, a court allowed Fern\u00e1ndez to serve her time under house arrest in Buenos Aires.",
      "While banned from running for public office, she remains outspoken against her political nemesis, libertarian President Javier Milei. From her apartment, she still posts diatribes on social media, waves at supporters gathered below her balcony and receives high-profile visitors, such as Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva last July.",

      "If it were to disappear, the average temperature of the capital could rise by up to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), according to biologist Luis Zambrano. Xochimilco and San Gregorio also reduce flooding during the rainy season, provide a natural carbon dioxide reservoir and are home to hundreds of species, such as herons and the Tlaloc frog.",

      "In a speech to the European Parliament, Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that \u201c2025 has been an eventful if not dramatic year for Greenland.\u201d He noted the challenge posed by climate change but did not mention President Donald Trump\u2019s talk of seizing the Arctic island.",
      "\u201cWe need cooperation and partnerships with like-minded countries and institutions who share our values. The EU has been a stable, reliable and important partner for Greenland for more than 40 years,\u201d the 34-year-old premier said in Strasbourg, France.",
      "He extended \u201ca heartfelt thank you\u201d to the EU \u201cfor your strong support for Greenland during challenging times we are going through right now. You have stood by us as a friend and partner. We will never forget this.\u201d",
      "Greenland was a colony under Denmark\u2019s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity. It remains part of the Danish realm.",

      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into the political fray, we\u2019re not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\u201d and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",
      "The letters and video he brought to Leo detail the fear that even legal migrants are facing every day. U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and arrested a city councilman in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\u201d wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\u201cThe pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he\u2019s doing to immigrants,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he\u2019s doing.\"",

      "Republicans party leader Bruno Retailleau, along with the Socialists, Greens and Communists, have pushed for the inclusion of a prime minister from another party.

      "England's chief prosecutor says the trial of two British men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government refused to label China a national security threat",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 The trial of two British men accused of spying for Beijing collapsed because the U.K. government refused to brand China a threat to national security, the country's chief prosecutor said.",
      "Former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash and academic Christopher Berry were charged in April 2024 with violating the Official Secrets Act by providing information or documents that could be \u201cuseful to an enemy\u201d and \u201cprejudicial to the safety or interests\u201d of the U.K. between late 2021 and February 2023.",
      "But Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said the case collapsed because no one from the government was willing to testify \u201cthat at the time of the offense China represented a threat to national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen this became apparent, the case could not proceed,\u201d he wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to lawmakers on Parliament\u2019s home affairs and justice committees.",
      "Under the Official Secrets Act, a statute from 1911, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an \u201cenemy.\u201d",
      "The two men deny wrongdoing, and the Chinese Embassy has called the allegations fabricated and dismissed them as \u201cmalicious slander.\u201d",
      "The case was dropped last month, weeks before the trial was due to begin, with prosecutors saying there was not enough evidence to proceed. The collapse of the case sparked allegations of political interference, which the government denies.",

      "He said evidence had to rely on the assessment of the previous Conservative government, which called China an \u201cepoch-defining challenge.\u201d",

      "The Conservative Party once dominated British politics, but is struggling to remain a force after being ousted in 2024",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- MANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Britain\u2019s Conservatives used to boast they were the world\u2019s most successful political party. Not anymore.",
      "The center-right party that governed the U.K. for more than 60 of the last 100 years before being ousted in 2024 is embracing Donald Trump -style policies including mass deportations and DOGE-style spending cuts as it battles to remain a contender for power.",
      "The Tories are fighting not just the Labour government to their left, but Reform UK to the right. Nigel Farage\u2019s hard-right party has topped opinion polls for months, trounced the Conservatives in May\u2019s local elections and has welcomed a stream of defecting Tory members and officials.",
      "\u201cYes, we have a mountain to climb,\u201d Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told party members at their annual conference, which ends Wednesday in Manchester. \u201cBut we have a song in our hearts, and we are up for the fight.\u201d",
      "Crowds were thin under the vast vaulted roof of the Manchester Central conference venue, a former railway station in the northwest England city, as delegates absorbed the party\u2019s diminished stature.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in a great place at the moment, we\u2019re aware of that,\u201d said Neil McCarthy, a member from northern England. \u201cThere needs to be passion, and we need to get the message across that we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives have undergone years of turmoil \u2013 some of it of their own making, some of it shared by incumbent parties in a world of economic and geopolitical instability.",
      "The economic benefits of Britain\u2019s 2020 exit from the European Union, championed by those now running of the party, have been elusive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a huge election victory in 2019 but was ousted by the party in 2022 after a string of ethics scandals.",
      "His successor, Liz Truss, sent inflation and interest rates soaring with a disastrous tax-cutting plan that wrecked the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for economic stability.",
      "Under Rishi Sunak, the government staggered on until the July 2024 election that delivered the Conservatives' worst-ever defeat.",
      "Badenoch, a small-state, low-tax advocate elected leader last year, has shifted the party to the right, announcing policies with a distinct MAGA flavor. She says a Conservative government will scrap carbon emissions reduction targets and deport 150,000 unauthorized immigrants a year with a removals force similar to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the U.S. as well as sharply reducing legal immigration. It would also leave the European Convention on Human Rights and limit the power of judges to block the will of government.",
      "Such policies alarm civil liberties groups. They are also similar to what Farage says he would do in power, leading some to ask what sets the Conservatives apart from Reform.",
      "Badenoch says the difference is fiscal prudence. She rejects Farage\u2019s promises to increase welfare spending and nationalize key industries such as steel.",
      "Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, said Badenoch\u2019s attempt to make the Tories \u201cReform with better economics\u201d risks \u201cnarrowing the appeal\u201d of the party.",
      "\u201cBasically, she\u2019s chucking quite a lot of people out of the Conservatives\u2019 broad church,\u201d Rutter said.",
      "Climate-change targets, human rights rules and support for managed immigration were until recently mainstream Conservative positions, and some Conservatives are uncomfortable with the party\u2019s rightward turn.",

      "Video published online by The Guardian newspaper showed him remarking that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see another white face\u201d in a neighborhood in Birmingham. Jenrick said he was not being racist but expressing concern about \u201cghettoized communities\u201d and lack of integration.",

      "The Manchester conference hall sported life-size cardboard Thatcher cutouts, tables stacked with biographies of the late leader and bottles of Thatcher whisky for 85 pounds ($114) each.

We\u2019re going to have another crisis, and Badenoch will be the right answer too.\u201d",

      "Milei\u2019s office said that he had instructed the Foreign Ministry and other officials \u201cto immediately take the administrative and diplomatic steps necessary\" to comply with a Supreme Court decision issued earlier Tuesday approving the extradition of the businessman, Fred Machado.",
      "Machado landed in Argentine custody in 2021, months after he fled a raft of charges filed against him in Texas, including drug trafficking, money laundering and wire fraud.",
      "The count of conspiracy to traffic narcotics centered on allegations that Machado and his associates illegally registered planes under shell companies, exported the aircraft to criminal organizations in Latin America and used the jets to fly multi-ton shipments of cocaine into the U.S.",

      "Cameroon's 92-year-old president has held his first campaign rally for the election in which the world's oldest head of state is seeking his eighth term",
      "YAOUNDE, Cameroon -- YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Cameroon\u2019s 92-year-old President Paul Biya appeared Tuesday at his first campaign rally for the upcoming election in which the world\u2019s oldest head of state is seeking his eighth term.",
      "Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, Biya promised to step up security in the region plagued by extremist attacks, curb youth unemployment and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if he is reelected in Sunday's vote.",
      "\u201cI am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cBased on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.\u201d",
      "The Far North Region is majority Muslim and one of Cameroon\u2019s poorest areas. It has been plagued by attacks and kidnappings for ransom by the extremist group Boko Haram.",
      "It also accounts for nearly 20% of the country\u2019s 8.2 million eligible voters, and two of the nine opposition candidates in the election \u2014 Biya\u2019s former allies Bello Bouba Maigari and Issa Tchiroma Bakary \u2014 command a strong following in the Far North.",
      "The outing was Biya\u2019s first in a campaign from which he has been noticeably absent, and he only recently returned from a weeklong stay in Switzerland. No official reason for his stay abroad has been given but Biya has regularly traveled to Europe for private stays and medical treatment in recent years.",

At least 43% of the country\u2019s citizens live in poverty as measured by core living standards such as income, education and health, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Still, Biya is likely to prevail in the election, especially after his strongest rival, Maurice Kamto, was barred from running in August and the opposition remains divided.",
      "Most of Cameroon\u2019s past elections have faced questions of credibility, with election authorities often accused of working in favor of Biya. Some of the election officers previously served in other roles in Biya\u2019s government. A two-term presidential limit was removed through a parliamentary vote in 2008.",

It's a recognition often called the \u201cgenius award,\u201d which comes with an $800,000 prize, paid over five years that fellows can spend however they choose.",
      "The foundation selects fellows over the course of years, considering a vast range of recommendations, largely from their peers.",
      "\u201cEach class doesn\u2019t have a theme and we\u2019re not creating a cohort around a certain idea,\" said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows program. \"But I think this year, we see empathy and deep engagement with community figures prominently in this class.\"",
      "Through different methodologies, many of the fellows \u201cboldly and unflinchingly\u201d reflect what they see and hear from deep engagement with their communities, she said.",
      "Because fellows don't apply or participate in anyway in their selection, the award often comes as a shock and sometimes coincides with difficult moments. Nabarun Dasgupta, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, had just left a team meeting where he shared that a longtime collaborator in harm reduction work had died when he saw multiple missed calls from a Chicago number, which then called again. It was the MacArthur Foundation.",

Tonika Lewis Johnson, a Chicago-based artist, planned to take the call in the car. The foundation representatives tried to get her to pull over before breaking the news, but she declined.",

      "The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to fill a critical vacancy at the top agency for worker rights, restoring it to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "The confirmation of Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Tuesday established a Republican majority at the agency and restored the quorum needed to make major policy and enforcement decisions in pursuit of Trump's civil rights priorities, including stamping out diversity and inclusion programs and rolling back protections for transgender workers.",
      "The Senate voted 51-47 along party lines to confirm Panuccio and more than 100 other Trump nominees under rules adopted by Republicans to make it easier to confirm large groups of lower-level, non-judicial nominations.",
      "Leading Democratic senators have said they won\u2019t confirm Trump\u2019s nominees to the EEOC unless he reverses his unprecedented firing in January of two Democratic commissioners before their terms were up, saying the move stripped the agency of its historic bipartisanship and independence.",

      "The EEOC has dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers and subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny. The agency also stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d an established concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out certain practices that disadvantage minorities, women, people with disabilities, older adults, and others. Lucas leveraged the EEOC to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",

      "Panuccio was nominated to replace Republican Keith Sonderling, who left the EEOC in 2024 and is now deputy labor secretary. The EEOC now has three commissioners, including Democrat Kalpana Kotagal. Trump has yet to announce nominations for the two remaining vacancies. Meanwhile, one of the two Democratic commissioners he fired, Jocelyn Samuels, has filed a lawsuit demanding to be reinstated.",

It said the platform's users under 13 cannot directly message others on Roblox, outside of games or experiences, and cannot directly message others during games or experiences unless the default setting is changed using parental controls.",
      "The company said it has rigorous text chat filters to block inappropriate words and phrases, attempts to direct under-13 users off the platform and the sharing of personal information such as phone number or address.

      "Two employees from a Lowe\u2019s in Richmond made the 90-minute drive early Monday to pick up Francine, who disappeared in September and recently was discovered at the company\u2019s distribution center in Garysburg, North Carolina.",
      "She was back on the job Tuesday, playing with customers, posing for photos and soaking in affection.",

      "Francine spends much of her time either at the customer service desk or in the store's seasonal area.

Store general manager Mike Sida said that disruption may have prompted Francine to seek comfort elsewhere.",
      "After store employees hadn't seen Francine for a few days, they reviewed past surveillance video. There were glimpses of her in the appliance section and then the receiving department, where she darted into a truck. An overnight manager is then seen shutting the truck's door and off it went to Garysburg, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) to the south.",
      "\u201cAnd then, of course, when she got down to the distribution center, she shot off the truck,\u201d Sida said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we found out where she was and she was missing.\u201d",
      "An animal control office set up humane traps at the distribution center, where photos of Francine were posted throughout. The center had dozens of monitoring cameras, and Lowe\u2019s brought in thermal drones to survey the area. An Instagram account unaffiliated with Lowe's dedicated to finding Francine grew to more than 34,000 followers.",
      "On Saturday, Francine was spotted on camera near the distribution center. After more humane traps were installed, a volunteer checked each trap throughout the night. Finally, one of the traps triggered and Francine's meows could be heard.",

After reaching a new quota of 18.3 million tons of imports, additional imports will face a 50% tariff. This is double the current 25% rate \u2014 a high price akin to U.S. President Donald Trump's steel measures. Neighboring nations such as Norway, Iceland and Ukraine will be exempt.",
      "The proposal attempts to buttress Europe's traditional steel manufacturers by imposing trade barriers so that Europe's markets don't become flooded with imports diverted by high American tariffs imposed earlier this year.",
      "Steel importers would be required to clearly declare where the products were melted and poured, and a complex quota system would govern what enters the EU common market.

      "The spring 2026 season has wrapped up with Paris, showcasing bold trends that are set to influence global fashion",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 The spring fashion season ended with silhouettes you could spot from a block away.",
      "As Paris Fashion Week wrapped up this week after myriad debuts and shake-ups, three trends took hold. Shoulders were broadened and jackets snapped to attention. Skin showed on the wearer\u2019s terms. And dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and meant for real life, not just red carpets.",
      "Call it Paris \u2019 no-nonsense reply to a jittery year: clothes that square your shoulders, put you in charge of your body and add walk-in impact to any weekday at work.",
      "Because the French capital remains the ultimate fashion gateway and the city that closes the season, trends seen here will rapidly cascade to high streets in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and beyond.",
      "Celebrity isn\u2019t new to fashion \u2014 but its pull is growing, and this season it felt central once again.",
      "Meghan Markle at Balenciaga, Madonna gracing Saint Laurent, Kim Kardashian sweeping into Maison Margiela, Nicole Kidman front-row at Chanel.",
      "The star arrivals turned shows into broadcast moments before the first look. Designers responded accordingly.",
      "This week\u2019s shows underlined the impact of the digital age. Celebrity-driven fashion shows now reach a global audience online, so designs must look great both in person and on camera. The most successful looks are those that impress live and also stand out in quick, eye-catching clips.",
      "The first and loudest shift was power up top. Jackets broadened the shoulder and cleaned up the line.",
      "Saint Laurent set the mood in razor-shouldered black. Mugler revived the hourglass with no apology. Givenchy eased the padding but kept the authority. Celine offered the daily uniform in crisp blazers and trousers.",
      "Even Chanel \u2014 a house that can tilt ornate \u2014 lightened the suit and cropped the jacket so it moved. The message is simple: after seasons of slouch, tailoring is back.",

      "Sheer looks were finished, not flimsy. Givenchy\u2019s transparency read as strength. Dior\u2019s lace felt airy, not uptight. Saint Laurent\u2019s clingy layers made openness the point. Low waists returned with a steadier hand: McQueen brought back the low-rise line without the old shock factor.",
      "Even the \u201cproper\u201d houses joined in \u2014 Chanel nodded to underwear roots, and Herm\u00e8s traced equestrian lines into the city. The fight over where the waist sits is back, but the choice belongs to the wearer.",
      "Dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and built for real life, not just red carpets. Paris remembered how to do drama without dead weight.",
      "Balenciaga floated a clean, sculpted volume that photographed big but wore light. Valentino dialed back ornament and let color and cut carry the room. Westwood kept the riotous spirit but cut it to move. Louis Vuitton scaled grandeur to everyday life. The cape stepped off the costume rack and into daylight at Dior \u2014 easy to wear, easy to fit, instant drama.",
      "Feathers followed suit across houses \u2014 glamorous, yes, but designed to walk. Dress-up isn\u2019t dead. It just punched a time card.",
      "In Milan, Bottega Veneta\u2019s Louise Trotter turned the house\u2019s craft into motion, showcasing sleek intrecciato outerwear and shimmering knits that backed the season\u2019s bigger-shoulder, lighter-feel mood. And at Versace, new creative lead Dario Vitale brought the brand down from Olympus to everyday \u2014 sexy, a little undone, and cut to live in, not just pose.",
      "Craft met tech quietly, resulting in fabrics that looked richer but felt lighter. Bags got more practical. These pieces don\u2019t want a glass case, they want scuffs and repeat wears. From New York, Michael Kors pushed the same idea of ease for a warming world \u2014 travel-minded, desert-light layers that breathe and move instead of cling.",
      "Color spoke plainly, too. Black led \u2014 it framed the big shoulder and sharpened the new suiting \u2014 with bright exceptions used like highlighters rather than paint buckets. You\u2019ll see the dark stuff first on the street, then the jewel tones. And the American minimalism test applied: strip the extras and let the shape do the work \u2014 a Calvin Klein lesson that echoed across runways.",
      "If one caption fits the week, Rick Owens supplied it when he sent models wading through water and made a case for tenacity in uncomfortable times. Paris took him at his word.",
      "The best looks didn\u2019t chase viral moments; they did a job. A strong jacket that squares your posture. A sheer dress that doesn\u2019t blink. A cape that turns a commute into an entrance. Three trends, plain as day \u2014 big shoulders, real skin, and dress-up with a day job \u2014 and a fashion capital reminding everyone that bold and useful can be the same thing.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 As gold prices hover at record highs, a leading Catholic leader in Peru\u2019s Amazon is urging countries that are destinations for the precious metal to help stem illegal mining that is poisoning rivers with mercury.",
      "Miguel \u00c1ngel Cadenas, an Augustinian from Spain who has lived in Peru\u2019s Amazon for three decades, said illegal mining has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic, citing the Tigre, Nanay, Napo and Putumayo rivers as some areas where communities are at risk.",
      "Tests have found mercury levels in some fish above World Health Organization limits, and hair samples from local residents analyzed by scientists and doctors also showed elevated concentrations.",
      "\u201cWe are in a delicate situation,\u201d Cadenas told The Associated Press. \u201cGiven that the Amazonian diet is rich in fish, we are talking about food insecurity.\u201d",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during small-scale mining. It contaminates water, accumulates in fish, and builds up in people\u2019s bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Cadenas said the health risks are especially acute in the Amazon, where medical services are scarce.",
      "Research in Peru\u2019s Madre de Dios region found that 43% of women of childbearing age had mercury levels above WHO safety limits, while hair samples in villages along Peru\u2019s Amazon riverways showed nearly 80% of residents exceeded the threshold.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people do not understand what is happening. There is barely any information,\u201d Cadenas said. \u201cThe state should first provide good information to its own population and then sources of food that allow other alternatives \u2014 which do not exist.\u201d",
      "Gold prices are soaring \u2014 analysts expect them to average around $3,675 per ounce by late 2025 with possible gains toward $4,000 by 2026, according to JPMorgan.",
      "Analysts say weak traceability systems make it easier for illegally mined gold to slip into global markets. Reports from Switzerland and sustainability researchers focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards say gold tainted with mercury in places like the Amazon is often laundered through refineries before entering jewelry, electronics or national reserves.",
      "Cadenas, who served as a missionary and bishop before being appointed in 2021 to lead the Apostolic Vicariate of Iquitos, stressed that Peru cannot handle the problem alone.",
      "\u201cAs long as the price of gold continues to rise, it is very difficult for a national government to manage this situation,\u201d he said. He pointed to gold-buying nations including China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.",
      "\u201cThe first responsibility should be that those countries buying gold require traceability, so that it is not possible to pass illegal gold into legality so easily,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThere are people who are being threatened with death, and this seems extremely serious to me,\u201d he said, citing reports that illegal miners in remote areas are tied to armed groups, including Colombian FARC dissidents.",
      "Peru has at times tried to rein in illegal mining and mercury use. In 2019 it launched Operation Mercury, a military-police crackdown that sharply reduced deforestation in the La Pampa mining zone, though much of the activity later shifted elsewhere. Authorities also announced record seizures of contraband mercury, including a four-ton shipment at Callao port this year.",
      "Still, Indigenous groups say enforcement is inconsistent, and regional governments across the Amazon warn that cross-border smuggling of mercury continues to fuel illegal mining.",
      "The city of Iquitos hosted the Amazon Water Summit last week, which the vicariate helped organize. Roughly 400 people from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil took part in 14 workshops on topics including water and extractivism, climate change and education.",
      "Cadenas noted that Loreto, Peru\u2019s largest Amazonian department, has the country\u2019s lowest access to drinking water \u2014 with about 60% of the population lacking potable water and sanitation. Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled two years ago that this amounted to an \u201cunconstitutional state of affairs,\u201d but he said the judgment has yet to be fulfilled.",

Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and weakening the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation continues to inch back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The current U.S. government shutdown has added to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. Trump has also threatened to use the shutdown to dole out mass firings and perhaps permanently shutter offices in attempt to punish Democrats for voting down GOP legislation.",
      "The scope of impact could come down to how long the impasse lasts. Wall Street, meanwhile, has largely been unmoved by the shutdown so far \u2014 but Treasury yields dropped after discouraging hiring data from ADP Research Wednesday.",

      "Trump\u2019s talk of making Canada the 51st state and his tariffs have Canadians feeling an undeniable sense of betrayal. Relations with Canada\u2019s southern neighbor and longtime ally haven\u2019t been worse.",
      "\u201cWe've had ups and downs, but this is the lowest point in relations that I can recall,\u201d said Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States and current deputy chairman of TD Bank.",
      "\u201cCanadians aren't being instructed what to do; they are simply voting with their feet,\" he said. \"I talk every day to ordinary citizens who are changing their vacation plans, and I talk to large business owners who are moving reward trips away or executive business trips.

Carney has said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs. He said the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods is 5.6% and remains the lowest among all its trading partners.",

      "The ties between the two countries are without parallel. About $2.5 billion (nearly $3.6 billion Canadian) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",

      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that the government shutdown is putting more stress on air traffic controllers who already have an extremely stressful job, as well as threatening a program that small communities rely on to help subsidize airline service.",
      "Controllers are expected to continue working without a paycheck, Duffy said, so they are now worried about how to pay their bills in addition to worrying about keeping flights safe. And there have started to be instances of controllers calling out sick, leading to delays at several airports Monday.",
      "\u201cNow what they think about as they\u2019re controlling our airspace is, how am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home. How do I put food on the table? I\u2019m working six days a week. Do I have to take a second job and drive Uber when I\u2019m already exhausted from doing a job that\u2019s already stressful to think about how I can make extra money because the government may not provide me a paycheck?\u201d Duffy said.",

      "The Transportation Department has been able to keep the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City open for now with funding from previous years, but Duffy is still concerned about the potential impact on efforts to hire and train new controllers in the hope of eliminating a longstanding shortage. Duffy said the support staff who train controllers after they come out of the academy could be laid off.",

      "Duffy said there has already been a small uptick in controllers calling out sick in a few places. Anytime that gets worse and creates a shortage of controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure controllers aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that creates delays and possibly cancellations. Near the end of the 35-day shutdown during the first Trump administration, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",
      "By Monday evening, the FAA was reporting that staffing shortages were creating delays in the Burbank, Newark and Denver airports. The worst problems were in Burbank, where California Gov. Gavin Newsom said no controllers were on duty during the evening, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours at that airport.",
      "The Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to small communities across the country will also quickly run out of money. Duffy said that program enjoys strong bipartisan support and provides an important lifeline to many small communities. It is especially important in Alaska, where flying is the only way to travel between many communities.",
      "\u201cThat money runs out this Sunday. So there\u2019s many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,\u201d Duffy said.",

      "The commission's CEO, Bryan Seeley, told The Associated Press the reporting line adds an important method of gathering information about the thousands of deals it is overseeing under terms of the $2.8 billion House settlement that reshaped college sports by allowing players to earn money. He said it is something \u201cwe've always been planning,\u201d and not a reaction to some of the struggles the start-up agency has endured since opening July 1.",

The reality is that for that to happen, there have to be reporting mechanisms in place and there has to be good technology that allows people who want to report anonymously to do so.\u201d",
      "Chadwick said the ability to report anonymously is especially important for colleges, where coaches, for decades, felt reluctant to publicly out rivals for cheating lest the rivals retaliate by turning the microscope on them.",
      "Created out of the lawsuit settlement, the CSC analyzes information about third-party NIL deals worth $600 or more that are submitted through an app called NIL Go, which was developed by Deloitte. Last month, it said it had approved nearly 6,100 deals worth about $35.4 million.",
      "Some school administrators and people running collectives have complained about delays in processing some of the deals.",
      "\u201cReview remains slow,\u201d Kansas State cap management and revenue sharing executive Julie Owen recently told AP, in feedback similar to that from others around the country. \"The functionality of the NIL Go website is less than ideal. It makes administrators\u2019 jobs more difficult, and providing additional information is far too complicated for student-athletes. These two should be distinguished, as CSC is not responsible for the operational side of NIL Go, which was created and operated by Deloitte.\u201d",
      "Seeley said NIL Go receives a high volume of admissions \u201cand the vast majority are getting cleared, and they're getting cleared expeditiously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some deals that are submitted to NIL Go, certainly a minority of deals, that are problematic,\u201d Seeley said. \u201cThey either have errors in data entry, or indicators of (forbidden) pay for play. There is heightened review of those deals and heightened review takes time. That is not a bug in the system. That's a feature of the system.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Lingering doubts about the economic promise of artificial intelligence technology are starting to get the attention of financial institutions that raised warning flags this week about an AI investment bubble.",
      "Officials at the Bank of England on Wednesday flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst.",
      "\u201cThe risk of a sharp market correction has increased,\u201d the U.K. central bank said.",
      "The head of the International Monetary Fund raised a similar alarm hours after the Bank of England\u2019s report.",
      "Global stock prices have been surging, fired up by \u201coptimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.",
      "But financial conditions could \u201cturn abruptly,\u201d she warned in a speech ahead of the organization\u2019s annual meeting next week in Washington.",
      "\u201cBubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear \u201cstretched\u201d beyond their worth and \u201ca general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,\u201d Slater said.",
      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\u201d Slater said. \u201cNobody really knows where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d",
      "Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power these AI products.",
      "OpenAI doesn't turn a profit but the privately held San Francisco firm is now the world's most valuable startup, with a market valuation of $500 billion. It recently signed major deals with chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded company, and its rival AMD.",
      "The Bank of England didn't name any specific companies but said that on \u201ca number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report said stock market valuations are \u201ccomparable to the peak\u201d of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which then deflated and led to a recession. With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) \u2014 FIFA is employing an alternative review system that allows coaches to appeal two referee\u2019s decisions per match at the Under-20 soccer World Cup in Chile",
      "The football video support (FVS) is a \u201csimplified version\u201d of VAR and has transformed the youth tournament into a testing ground for new technologies.",
      "Cards that vary between blue and purple are held by coaches, who are in charge of requesting reviews.",
      "During the group stage, its use has proven crucial, defining the course of several matches played in the cities of Santiago, Valpara\u00edso, Rancagua and Talca. The system was deployed in more than a dozen matches in the early part of the tournament.",
      "FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. He challenged a penalty, but the request was ultimately ruled out by the referee.",
      "Since then, the review system has had a role in several matches. Of the 12 games in the first round of the group stage, the \u201clight VAR\u201d was used in seven.",
      "It proved decisive in Norway\u2019s 1-0 victory over Nigeria after a review of a handball by Nigeria defender Ahmed Akinyele, which American referee Joe Dickerson had ignored.",
      "FVS also disallowed a goal in Argentina's 4-1 win against Australia \u2014 the review denying a tying goal for the Socceroos.",
      "Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso Gonz\u00e1lez being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.",
      "Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.",
      "According to world soccer's ruling body FIFA, the FVS system aims to \u201cdemocratize football by introducing video review technology as a complementary option,\u201d not only for top-level competitions but also for those that \u201ccould not afford VAR infrastructure,\u201d thanks to its low cost and simplified operation.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",

      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",

      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",

      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",

      "Minnesota regulators have approved the takeover of Minnesota Power by an investment group, despite opposition from the state attorney general and consumer advocates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.",
      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",
      "Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power\u2019s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.",
      "Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.",
      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.",
      "The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we\u2019ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,\u201d Sieben said.",

      "Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group\u2019s \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2014 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",
      "Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cPrivate equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,\" Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.",
      "You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won\u2019t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "A majority of Fed officials felt that the risk unemployment would rise had worsened since their previous meeting in July, while the risk of rising inflation \u201chad either diminished or not increased,\u201d the minutes said. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%, its first cut this year.",
      "Rate cuts by the Fed can gradually lower borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Still, the minutes underscored the deep division on the 19-person committee between those who feel that the Fed's short-term rate is too high and weighing on the economy, and those who point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence that the Fed needs to be cautious about reducing rates.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut: Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes noted that \u201ca few\u201d policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \u201cthere was merit\u201d in such a step.",

Rental costs are steadily declining and will bring down inflation, he said, while tariff revenue will reduce the government\u2019s budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, which gives the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet many other Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \u201cinflation is too high\u201d and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",

      "The minutes provide insight into how the Fed's policymakers were thinking last month about inflation, interest rates, and hiring. Since then, however, the federal government shutdown has cut off the flow of economic data that the Fed relies on to inform its decisions.

      "Officials linked DNA from Joseph Nowakowski, who died in 1998, to the killing of 50-year-old Catherine Blackburn in September 1964, Albany Police Chief Brendan Cox said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "The identification was made through a joint effort by the Criminal Investigation Resource Center at Russell Sage College and other forensic and investigative agencies, authorities said. The work, which spanned several years, eventually allowed authorities to match DNA from the crime scene with DNA from Nowakowski, whose body was recently exhumed as part of the investigation, Albany Police Commander Melissa Morey said. Nowakowski's relatives cooperated with the investigation, she said.",
      "Nowakowski had a lengthy criminal record, including an attack on an elderly woman in 1973 in Schenectady and several burglaries, authorities said.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to make sure that we took every step possible to be 100% positive that he was, in fact, tied to this and that we have his DNA on file,\u201d Cox said.",

      "Authorities say Ward entered the home of 15-year-old Stacy Payne on July 11, 2001, raped her and struck and stabbed the girl repeatedly with a dumbbell and a knife. She was airlifted from her town of Dale to a hospital and died hours later.",

      "Ward\u2019s case has wound through the courts for decades. He was found guilty of murder and rape in 2002 and sentenced to death. But the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial.",
      "Ward then pleaded guilty in 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.",
      "Two years later, he sued Indiana seeking to halt all executions. He argued that Indiana's manner of carrying out \u201ccapital punishment is arbitrary\" and \"offensive to evolving standards of decency.\u201d",

      "The new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas spells trouble for rural parts of the U.S. that rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 When Rob Coverdale started his job in 2023 as superintendent of the K-12 Crow Creek Tribal School in South Dakota, there were 15 unfilled teaching positions.",
      "Within nine months, he had filled those vacancies with Filipino teachers, the majority of whom arrived on the H-1B, a visa for skilled workers in specialty occupations.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve hired the H-1B teachers because we quite simply didn\u2019t have other applicants for those positions,\" Coverdale said. \u201cSo they're certainly not taking jobs from Americans. They're filling jobs that otherwise just simply we would not get filled.\u201d",
      "Now a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications spells trouble for those like Coverdale in rural parts of the country who rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions like education and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced the fee on Sept. 19, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. Since then, the White House has said the fee won't apply to existing visa holders and offered a form to request exemptions from the charge.",
      "H-1Bs are primarily associated with tech workers from India. Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category.",
      "Over the last decade, the U.S. has faced a shortage in those and other sectors. One in eight public school positions are vacant or filled by uncertified teachers, and the American Medical Association projects a shortage of 87,000 physicians in the next decade. The shortages are often worse in small, rural communities that struggle to fill jobs due to lower wages and often lack basic necessities like shopping and home rental options.",
      "H-1B and J-1 visas provide communities an option to hire immigrants with advanced training and certification. The J-1s are short-term visas for cultural exchange programs that aren't subject to the new fee but, unlike the H-1B, don't offer a pathway to permanent residency.",
      "While large companies may be able to absorb the new fee, that's not an option for most rural communities, said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.",
      "\u201cIt really is potentially the cost of the salary and benefits of one teacher, maybe even two, depending on the state,\u201d she said. \u201cAttaching that price tag to a single hire, it just simply puts that position out of reach for rural budgets.\u201d",
      "A coalition of health care providers, religious groups and educators filed a lawsuit on Friday to stop the H-1B fee, saying it would harm hospitals, churches, schools and industries that rely on the visa. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment and referred a query to its website.",
      "Coverdale said spots like Stephan, where Crow Creek is based, struggle to attract workers in part because of their isolation. Stephan is nearly an hour's drive from the nearest Walmart or any place that sells clothes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe more remote you are, the more challenging it is for your staff members to get to your school and serve your kids,\u201d he said.",
      "Among Coverdale's hires is Mary Joy Ponce-Torres, who had 24 years of teaching experience in the Philippines and now teaches history at Crow Creek. It was a cultural adjustment, but Ponce-Torres said she's made friends and Stephan is now a second home.",
      "\u201cI came from a private school,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw it was more like a rural area ... but maybe I was also looking for the same vibe, the same atmosphere where I can just take my time, take things in a much slower pace.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants like Ponce-Torres leave their family behind to pursue the experience and higher wages that a U.S. job can provide.",

It is super important, in my opinion, to actually transition from the J-1 visas to the H-1B.\u201d",
      "Without enough staff, schools may hire uncertified teachers, combine classes, increase caseloads for special education managers or drop some course offerings. Shipley said any future shortage of teachers in Bison would force some classes to move online.",

This is kind of where everybody goes.\u201d",
      "Leading medical societies have called on the Trump administration and lawmakers to grant exemptions from the fee to immigrant health care workers.",
      "\u201cGiven the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\u201d the American Hospital Association said in a statement.",
      "Allison Roberts, vice president of human resources at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in Watertown, South Dakota, said the change could be dire for health care in rural America.",
      "\u201cIf we end up not being exempt, the variation between what it is now and that $100,000 fee is going to really take your smaller, rural health care institutions out of the picture,\u201d she said.",

      "A down-ballot race for New Orleans clerk of criminal court has turned personal and contentious, as candidate Calvin Duncan faces attacks over whether he was truly exonerated for murder",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A down-ballot race for New Orleans clerk of criminal court has turned personal and contentious, as candidate Calvin Duncan, who spent three decades in prison before his conviction was vacated, faces attacks from Louisiana\u2019s attorney general and the incumbent clerk over whether he was truly exonerated.",
      "Duncan, 62, taught himself law while in prison and struggled for years access his records. He says that makes his quest to be the city\u2019s chief criminal recordkeeper personal.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t never want to have what happened to me happen to nobody else,\u201d said Duncan, whose murder conviction was vacated by a judge in 2021. He's listed in the National Registry of Exonerations alongside figures like \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d member Yousef Salaam, now a New York City councilmember.",
      "But Duncan's campaign has been overshadowed by disputes about the word \u201cexoneration\u201d in his case, injecting drama into the final stretch of an otherwise sleepy municipal race. Voters head to the polls Saturday.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and incumbent clerk Darren Lombard have both denied Duncan\u2019s innocence, pointing to a 2011 plea deal for manslaughter and armed robbery that Duncan says he accepted only to secure his release. In televised debates, media interviews and campaign advertisements, Lombard has called Duncan a murderer.",
      "Duncan, a Democrat, accuses his opponents of trying to mislead voters. Duncan's supporters say it's an example of bare-knuckle politics in New Orleans, where more than 10 candidates are also running to replace term-limited Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who pleaded not guilty in September to corruption charges.",
      "Jessica Paredes, executive director of the exoneration registry, said there should be no doubt that Duncan's case deserves to be listed among the more than 3,700 exonerations tracked since 1989.",
      "\u201cWe err conservatively to maintain the integrity of the database,\u201d she said. \u201cCalvin\u2019s exoneration was not one of these close calls. His case clearly meets our inclusion criteria.\u201d",
      "Duncan presented new evidence of his innocence in a 1981 fatal shooting \u2014 including that police officers had lied in court \u2014 prior to his release from prison. A judge later vacated Duncan\u2019s conviction under a legal statute of \u201cfactual innocence\u201d and prosecutors dismissed the charges.",
      "Legal scholars say there is no across-the-board legal standard for exoneration, but Paredes' group generally defines it as occurring \u201cwhen a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared after new evidence of innocence becomes available.\u201d",
      "Even before Duncan ran for office, his case drew scrutiny from Murrill, the state's Republican attorney general. After Duncan earned a law degree in 2023 and sought to obtain $330,000 in state compensation for his wrongful conviction, Murrill threatened to contest his ability to practice law unless he dropped his claim for the money, according to Jacob Weixler, Duncan\u2019s attorney.",

      "In the legal community, Duncan had already achieved a degree of celebrity before running for office.",

Duncan was the driving force behind a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended non-unanimous jury convictions in Louisiana and Oregon, the only two states still allowing a practice rooted in the Jim Crow era, said G. Ben Cohen, an attorney in the case.",

The New Orleans criminal court system still leans heavily on paper records, and thousands of files were lost during Hurricane Katrina.

      "The federal judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of former FBI director James Comey has already handled cases in President Donald Trump\u2019s orbit",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 Michael Nachmanoff has built a quiet reputation in the federal courthouse in northern Virginia \u2014 a onetime public defender turned judge known for methodical preparation and a cool temperament. On Wednesday, he\u2019ll find himself at the center of a political storm: presiding over the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of former FBI director James Comey.",
      "Confirmed to the bench by President Joe Biden in 2021, Nachmanoff was randomly assigned to the case after a Virginia grand jury indicted Comey last month on charges including obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The assignment instantly drew Donald Trump\u2019s attention. The president, long fixated on Comey, blasted him as a \u201cDirty Cop\u201d and derided Nachmanoff as a \u201cCrooked Joe Biden appointed Judge\u201d while celebrating the charges as \u201cJUSTICE FOR AMERICA!\u201d",
      "Despite the political noise, lawyers who know Nachmanoff say he is unlikely to be swayed.",
      "\u201cWhatever his personal politics are, I do not think that they will enter the courtroom,\u201d said longtime Virginia defense attorney Nina Ginsberg, who has tried cases before him. \u201cHe\u2019s confident enough in his ability to judge fairly that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be influenced by politics or the media coverage.\u201d",
      "Nachmanoff, 57, came to the bench after more than a decade as the Eastern District of Virginia\u2019s top federal public defender, where he argued and won a Supreme Court case that helped reduce racial disparities in crack cocaine sentencing. He served six years as a magistrate judge, handling some politically tinged cases. In 2019 he oversaw the first appearances of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, releasing them on $1 million bonds. More recently, he refused to block the CIA from firing Dr. Terry Adirim, a Pentagon physician targeted by Trump allies over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.",
      "\u201cHe was an aggressive advocate, the kind of lawyer who left no stones unturned,\u201d Ginsberg said of the judge. She said he conducts his courtroom in an even-handed, respectful manner.",
      "Timothy Belevetz, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, said Nachmanoff was \u201calways a worthy adversary.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been around the courthouse for years and years and years,\u201d Belevetz said. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-respected. He\u2019s very smart, he\u2019ll give parties a fair shake, he listens to the arguments.\u201d",
      "Comey was charged late last month with lying to Congress. Days earlier, Trump appeared to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the former FBI director and other political enemies.",

So let\u2019s have a trial.\u201d",
      "The clash between Trump and Comey has been building for years. Trump fired the FBI director in 2017, just months into his first term, as the bureau investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Since then, the former president has repeatedly called for Comey\u2019s prosecution and, in the days before the indictment, publicly pressed Bondi to act.",
      "For lawyers who\u2019ve worked with Nachmanoff, that kind of political noise is unlikely to matter. They point to his long record of independence and constitutional rigor. \u201cFederal public defenders are renowned for their fidelity to the Constitution and due process,\u201d said Lisa Wayne, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is set to make his first court appearance Wednesday in a Justice Department criminal case accusing him of having lied to Congress five years ago.",
      "The arraignment is expected to be brief, but the moment is nonetheless loaded with historical significance given that the case has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being weaponized in pursuit of President Donald Trump's political enemies and operating at the behest of a White House determined to seek retribution.",
      "Comey is expected to plead not guilty at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, kickstarting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing that the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution.",
      "The indictment two weeks ago followed an extraordinary chain of events that saw Trump publicly implore Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and other perceived adversaries. The president also replaced the veteran attorney who had been overseeing the investigation with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor. Halligan rushed to file charges before a legal deadline lapsed despite warnings from other lawyers in the office that the evidence was insufficient for an indictment.",
      "The two-count indictment alleges that Comey made a false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020, by denying he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source to the news media, and that he obstructed a congressional proceeding. Comey has denied any wrongdoing and has said he was looking forward to a trial. The indictment does not identify the associate or say what information may have been discussed with the media, making it challenging to assess the strength of the evidence or to even fully parse the allegations.",
      "Though an indictment is typically just the start of a protracted court process, the Justice Department has trumpeted the development itself as something of a win, regardless of the outcome. Trump administration officials are likely to point to any conviction as proof the case was well-justified, but an acquittal or even dismissal may also be held up as further support for their long-running contention that the criminal justice system is stacked against them.",
      "The judge randomly assigned to the case, Michael Nachmanoff, is a Biden administration appointee and former chief federal defender. Known for methodical preparation and a cool temperament, the judge and his background have already drawn the president's attention, with Trump deriding him as a \u201cCrooked Joe Biden appointed Judge.\u201d",

      "INDIAN ROCKS BEACH, Fla. -- INDIAN ROCKS BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The white sandy beaches along a swath of Florida's Gulf Coast were battered by three hurricanes last year, leading to a multimillion-dollar effort to repair a coastline that is the region's economic engine.",
      "Crews are working with dredges, trucks and pipelines along the 35-mile (56-kilometer) stretch of beach in Pinellas County that includes cities such as Clearwater Beach, Indian Rocks Beach, Belleair Beach and Redington Beach. It's a prime tourist destination that is still recovering from hurricanes Helene, Milton and Debby.",
      "Helene was the most destructive for the beach towns, even though it made landfall far to the north. Twelve people died in Pinellas County because of strong storm surge that reached 8 feet (2.4 meters) high in some places.",
      "In past years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played a major role in beach restoration, but not this time. The Corps wants private landowners to sign up for permanent easements that would allow government access in perpetuity \u2014 a change that has met with stiff resistance.",
      "So Pinellas County is doing the beach restoration itself, spending more than $125 million in tourism tax revenue to cover the costs. The county also has an easement program, but because some property owners won't sign up, there will be gaps in the beach renourishment that could lead to damage in future storms.",
      "\u201cWe can't do it as well as we could,\u201d said Barry Burton, the Pinellas County administrator. \u201cOur desire is to place sand across as much of the beach as we can.\u201d",
      "The project calls for using 2.5 million cubic yards (1.9 million cubic meters) of sand that's being dredged and pumped from offshore. In places where property owners refused to sign the easements, new sand is being placed toward the Gulf side of the beach, which is public. The beaches are being widened by as much as 100 feet (30 meters).",
      "For its part, the Army Corps said it can't justify spending millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars on beach renourishment without permanent easements to allow access.",

      "California is the third U.S. state to designate Diwali as an official statewide holiday",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 California has become the third U.S. state to designate Diwali \u2014 the Hindu \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d \u2014 as an official statewide holiday.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law Tuesday to go into effect on Jan. 1. It would authorize public schools and community colleges to close on Diwali. State employees could elect to take the day off and public school students will get an excused absence to celebrate the holiday. The new law recognizes that Diwali is also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.",
      "Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to make Diwali a statewide holiday in 2024, followed by Connecticut earlier this year.",
      "Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat from San Jose who coauthored the bill with Darshana Patel, an assemblymember from San Diego, said he grew up celebrating the festival with family members, but it was an experience that was isolated from the rest of his life.",
      "\u201cTo have South Asian children be able to proudly celebrate and share it with others is a significant moment,\u201d he said.",
      "San Jose, a city in California's Silicon Valley, has a sizable Indian American population. According to a 2025 Pew survey, 960,000 out of the nation's Indian population of 4.9 million \u2014 or 20% \u2014 live in California. Hindu American organizations, including the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus in North America, advocated for the law.",
      "\u201cThe provisions that allow students to take the day off without repercussion and state employees to take paid leave are important leaps toward making Diwali truly accessible to those who celebrate,\u201d said Samir Kalra, managing director of the Hindu American Foundation.",
      "Diwali, which falls on Oct. 20 this year, is derived from the word \u201cDeepavali,\u201d which means \u201ca row of lights.\u201d Celebrants light rows of lamps to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The holiday is celebrated with festive gatherings, fireworks displays, feasts and prayer.",
      "While Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, it is also observed by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. The origin story of Diwali varies depending on the region. All these stories, across faiths, have the same underlying themes of good triumphing over evil and light over darkness.",

      "Puneet Kaur Sandhu, Sacramento-based senior state policy manager for the Sikh Coalition, said her organization worked with Ash Kalra to make sure the bill's language included celebrants from other religions whose holidays coincide with Diwali as well.",

      "Rohit Shendrikar, board chair for the South Asian Network in Southern California, said this law not only recognizes the South Asian community in California, but also the impact its members have had on the state.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's attorney general claimed Tuesday that the online gaming platform Roblox has become a \u201cplayground for predators\u201d as he announced a lawsuit accusing the company of lax child safety measures.",
      "The Kentucky suit, filed by his office Monday in a state court, is the latest action alleging that the wildly popular site isn\u2019t doing enough to protect children on its gaming services.",
      "To bolster safeguards for children and teenagers flocking to the site, the company needs to install effective age verifications and content filters, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said. Added parental notifications also are needed, he said.",
      "Courtney Norris, a Kentucky mother of three who joined Coleman at a news conference, said she mistakenly viewed Roblox as a safe online gaming choice for her children.",
      "\"I came to realize, later than I would like to admit, that it actually is the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of the internet, targeted at children,\u201d she said.",

      "Roblox on Tuesday pushed back against the allegations.",
      "\u201cWe have rigorous safety measures in place from advanced AI models to an expertly trained team of thousands moderating our platform 24/7 for inappropriate content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \"No system is perfect and our work on safety is never done. We are constantly innovating our safety systems, including adding 100 new safeguards, such as facial age estimation, this year alone.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it has 111 million daily active users. The company said in an email Tuesday that it implements strict safety defaults for its youngest users. It said the platform's users under 13 cannot directly message others on Roblox, outside of games or experiences, and cannot directly message others during games or experiences unless the default setting is changed using parental controls.",
      "The company said it has rigorous text chat filters to block inappropriate words and phrases, attempts to direct under-13 users off the platform and the sharing of personal information such as phone number or address. It does not allow user-to-user image sharing and prohibits sexual conversations, it said.",

When police arrived at around 3:45 p.m., the child was dead.",
      "The 2-year-old was the only child at Cobb's daycare, though there are typically 10, according to police. Cobb was taken to the Lowndes County Jail. Jail records did not indicate if Cobb had an attorney who could speak on her behalf, and officials could not confirm whether she had one.",

      "Arredondo's trial is also on hold because of a pending federal lawsuit by local prosecutors that seeks to compel testimony from Border Patrol agents who were on the scene that day.

      "The Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, tracked 860 antisemitic acts reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide.

      "A license plate reader recorded Proctor's vehicle near the scene within minutes of the crime, and investigators found items in Proctor's home similar to those used to carry out the attempted arson, including black boots, a different gas can that also had a hole carved in the top, and a portion of fuse, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thorpe wrote.",
      "According to prosecutors, Proctor bought more fuse days after the failed attempt and returned to the crime scene a week later.

      "Trump signed into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 legislation to ensure federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse.

Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",

      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",

Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be.

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:31:05 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices.",

As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank\u00a0according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.",

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",

      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds.

      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",

      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\"",

      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",

      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",

North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",

      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",
      "In a comment to CBS News, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice had asked Apple to remove the app.",
      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents. Another such tool, called Coqui, was still available on the App Store as of Friday morning. Some migrants are relying on the apps to alert them to the location of ICE agents to avoid arrest amid the Trump administration's ramp up of deportation activities.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela.",
      "Democrats forced a vote on the issue under the War Powers Act. In a 48-51 vote, the effort failed to garner enough support to move forward.",
      "The resolution, led by Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia, would have blocked the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with \"any non-state organization engaged in the promotion, trafficking, and distribution of illegal drugs and other related activities\" without congressional authorization.",
      "\"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way,\" Schiff said Wednesday, saying the strikes risk escalating into a full-blown conflict with Venezuela. \"I feel it is plainly unconstitutional.\"",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean Sea have prompted bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers questioning their legality. Congress, which has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration says it has conducted four strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela since Sept. 2, killing at least 21 people.",
      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans, told reporters the president has the authority to order the strikes without congressional authorization.",
      "\"These are targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" he said.",
      "Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project, said, \"The situation in the Caribbean is not that.\"",
      "Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations \"provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state.\"",
      "Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them.",
      "\"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization,\" Kaine said. \"These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress \u2014 not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped \u2014 unless authorized by congressional action.\"",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",
      "\"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,\" Paul wrote.",
      "Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us now there names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case.\"",
      "Schiff said Congress has abdicated its war-declaring responsibilities because members don't want to go on the record on the issue. He said that sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "\"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore,\" Schiff said. \"What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action? I don't think this is a practice we want to see other nations adopt.\"",

    "summary": "Former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump, appeared in Virginia for an arraignment, in his first court appearance since he was charged.",
    "story": [
      "Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from congressional testimony he gave five years ago, appearing in court for an arraignment Wednesday after the Justice Department criminally charged the ex-FBI chief and Trump foe in late September.",
      "The proceeding at the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, came nearly two weeks after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation when he testified before a Senate panel in September 2020.",
      "Comey spoke during the proceedings Wednesday. When the judge asked whether he understood the charges, he replied, \"I do, your honor, thank you very much.\" Prosecutors did not seek to have him detained, and Comey was released on his own recognizance.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over the case, set a trial date for early January, though that could change. Comey will seek to have the indictment dismissed before a trial, his lawyer said..",
      "During the arraignment, Nathaniel Lemons, one of the federal prosecutors brought on to work on the case, said it could involve classified information, which could bring complications. Nachmanoff, however, noted that only two charges have been brought against Comey.",
      "\"The government is going to be under an extraordinary amount of pressure\" to produce classified documents or declassify them, Nachmanoff said. \"There should be no reason this case gets off track.\"",
      "Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey's lawyer, told the court that they \"see this as a simple case.\"",
      "Prosecutors estimated a trial will take two to three days, though Fitzgerald said he would seek to have the case dismissed on several grounds: vindictive and unlawful prosecution, and the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment to that role.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert from the post.",
      "Siebert had been kept on as the top prosecutor for the office by the judges on the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia in May. Because of the involvement of judges in that district in extending Siebert's tenure as U.S. attorney, the challenge to Halligan's appointment will be heard by other judges outside the district.",
      "Comey has said he's innocent and, in a video after he was indicted, declared \"let's have a trial.\" His wife, Patrice, and daughter, Maurene, a former prosecutor in New York, were in the courtroom for the proceeding. Maurene Comey was fired from the Justice Department in July and has since sued the Trump administration over her ouster.",
      "The Justice Department's prosecution of the former FBI director marked a significant escalation in President Trump's efforts to go after his political foes. Mr. Trump has for years attacked Comey, who was FBI director when the bureau investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "Days before Comey was indicted, the president took to social media to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against the former FBI director and other political opponents, writing, \"We can't delay any longer.\"",
      "More on Comey's arraignment",
      "The arraignment took place in open court, but cameras were not allowed.",
      "Comey's lawyer said his team would file several motions to have the charges dismissed, including alleging the former FBI director is a victim of vindictive prosecution and arguing the U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Halligan, was appointed invalidly.",
      "\"Patrick Fitzgerald is a hell of a lawyer, and I would not want to pre-guess what strategy he's going to follow here,\" said Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Where did Comey's arraignment take place?",
      "Comey was arraigned at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, which is part of the Eastern District of Virginia. The case is likely being heard there because the charges are based on a 2020 Senate hearing that Comey attended remotely from his Virginia home.",
      "If the case goes to trial, Comey will face a jury pool made up of residents of the Washington, D.C., suburbs \u2014 an area that generally disfavors President Trump.",
      "Some 62.6% of voters in the eastern district's Alexandria division voted for Democrat Kamala Harris last year, and 34.1% voted for Mr. Trump. The division includes Alexandria and several other cities and counties in Northern Virginia.",
      "Who is the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan?",
      "The case against Comey is being overseen by Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was sworn into the role just days before Comey was indicted.",
      "A former Florida insurance lawyer, Halligan previously worked as a personal attorney to Mr. Trump, and was part of his defense team in a federal case accusing him of mishandling classified documents. More recently, Halligan worked as a White House aide.",
      "She took over the office after the resignation of former acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "In an unusual move, Halligan has handled parts of the prosecution herself so far. She personally signed Comey's indictment and appeared in court when the grand jury returned the indictment.",
      "Two assistant U.S. attorneys from the Eastern District of North Carolina were added to the case Tuesday: Gabriel Diaz and Nathaniel Lemons.",
      "Who is Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald?",
      "Comey is being represented by Fitzgerald, a well-known attorney who retired as a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 2023.",
      "Fitzgerald was named special counsel in George W. Bush's administration, to investigate\u00a0 a 2003 leak that revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. He also served as U.S. attorney in Chicago for more than a decade, overseeing the prosecution of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.",
      "Who is Judge Nachmanoff?",
      "Nachmanoff was assigned to oversee Comey's case. He was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in a 52-46 vote. Three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting yes: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "Nachmanoff previously worked in the district as a public defender and magistrate judge. While in the latter role, he oversaw the 2019 arraignment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two players in Mr. Trump's first impeachment who were charged with campaign finance violations.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked Nachmanoff, writing on Truth Social that Comey \"was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he's off to a very good start.\"",
      "What is Comey charged with?",
      "The first count accuses him of making a false statement in a September 2020 Senate hearing.",
      "Prosecutors allege Comey falsely asserted he had never authorized an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton. In a testy back-and-forth five years ago, Comey told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that he stood by testimony he gave in 2017 in which he said he didn't approve any anonymous sources.",
      "The indictment does not explain the substance of the alleged leak or specify which FBI staffer Comey is accused of giving permission to leak.",
      "Cruz's questions focused on an incident in which Comey and his onetime deputy, Andrew McCabe, gave inconsistent stories about a 2016 Wall Street Journal article on one of the FBI's Clinton probes. McCabe said he told Comey after the story came out that McCabe had authorized staffers to talk to the Journal, but Comey says McCabe told him no such thing. The Justice Department's internal watchdog sided with Comey and found McCabe lacked candor.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CNN interview, McCabe said he hasn't been approached by the FBI in connection with the Comey probe and doubted the indictment was about him, noting that he didn't ask Comey for permission to release information to the media because he didn't need permission.",
      "Comey has also been probed by the Justice Department's watchdog for releasing memos on his interactions with Mr. Trump to his friend, Daniel Richman, who shared their contents to the New York Times. The watchdog found Comey violated FBI policies but didn't leak classified material.",
      "The second count against Comey accuses him of obstructing a congressional proceeding by \"making false and misleading statements\" in the same 2020 hearing.",
      "And in a rare move, the grand jury declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress in the 2020 hearing, relating to testimony Comey gave lawmakers that he didn't remember getting a tip from the intelligence community referring to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.",
      "Many critics believe the Comey indictment is the result of Mr. Trump's determination to punish a longtime political foe. The president fired Comey in 2017, and the two have traded barbs since then. Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey before he was charged, and the president celebrated the indictment shortly after it was handed down.",
      "Before Comey was charged, some staff in the Office of the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia circulated a memo arguing charges should not be brought, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the case. After Comey was indicted, Bondi said in a statement the move \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have struck a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an \"agreed upon line,\" President Trump announced Wednesday, in what he called the \"first Phase\" of a peace deal to end the two-year-long war.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Two regional sources told CBS News there is an agreement on all sides in principle on a hostage release, but procedural issues remain. Once those details are handled, it will be 48 hours before any release starts, sources said.",
      "A senior White House official said the hostages could be released on Monday. The deal will go to Israel's cabinet for approval on Thursday, and if it votes yes, the Israeli military will need to withdraw to an agreed-upon line in the Gaza Strip, which should take under 24 hours. Then Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the official said.",
      "Majed al-Ansari, an adviser to Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, also confirmed the deal, writing on X that an agreement was reached on \"the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also released a short statement on the hostages that read, \"With God's help we will bring them all home.\"",
      "In a follow-up statement, Netanyahu said it was a \"big day for Israel\" and that he would \"convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home.\"",
      "Hamas also confirmed in a statement it had reached an agreement.",
      "The terrorist group praised Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators in helping broker a deal, and specifically thanked Mr. Trump for his \"efforts.\" It also called on the president to ensure that Israel \"fully complies with the terms of the agreement.\"",
      "In his earlier Truth Social post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"All Parties will be treated fairly!\"",
      "The announcement came just hours after Mr. Trump said he may travel to the Middle East this weekend, and was open to potentially traveling to the Gaza Strip.",
      "During an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump read a note that was passed to him by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The president said Rubio's note said negotiators were \"pretty close to a deal,\" and that they would \"need him\" pretty quickly.",
      "A little over a week ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan at a White House meeting with Netanyahu, who expressed his full support for the proposal.",
      "The current round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 6 in Egypt, with Egyptian and Qatari officials acting as intermediaries. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been expected to join the talks on Wednesday, days after Netanyahu confirmed he had sent a delegation \"to close the technical details of the release of our hostages.\"",
      "The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist organization, has killed more than 67,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.",
      "Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal \u2014 including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza. But the group had said other parts of the plan needed to be further negotiated.",

      "Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair of the Eastern District of Louisiana told CBS News that Groves, convicted of a 2018 double murder, was arrested shortly after 2 p.m. ET following a coordinated operation between the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force and the Atlanta Police Department SWAT team.",
      "The arrest stemmed from a Crime Stoppers Greater New Orleans tip received earlier this summer that pointed investigators toward the Atlanta area. Fair declined to specify when the tip came in, citing safety concerns and the need to protect the informant.",

      "After weeks of follow-up work, marshals in Louisiana pushed out a lead to counterparts in Georgia. Officers executed a search warrant at a home in the Atlanta area that investigators believe Groves may have been staying in for some time. Fair said it was \"possibly a rental home,\" but added, \"There's a lot of follow-up work that'll be done on this to answer those questions.\"",

      "\"We did have concerns maybe he wasn't in the house,\" Fair said. \"But ultimately, they found him hiding in a crawl space. I believe that crawl space was in the basement \u2026 and he had put some thought and work into the hiding space he was in.\"",
      "Fair said Groves appeared \"prepared to hide for the long haul\" and may have reinforced the space himself. He was taken into custody without injury, and no weapons were recovered at the scene, though a further search of the residence is now underway.",
      "Authorities are still piecing together how Groves traveled from New Orleans to Atlanta, whether he received assistance and how long he had been in Georgia.",
      "\"I'd probably guess [he traveled by] car, but we don't know,\" Fair said. \"That's going to be part of the follow-up work that's going to be done now that he's in custody.\"",
      "Fair said Groves was believed to be a ringleader in the May 16 jailbreak from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, in which inmates pulled a jail cell door off its tracks, removed a toilet from an empty cell and crawled through a hole in the wall before scaling a fence. The brazen escape exposed design flaws and security failures in the 10-year-old jail, Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "All 10 escapees have now been captured.",
      "The U.S. Marshals credited a coalition of agencies \u2014 including the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, New Orleans Police Department, Louisiana State Police, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI and Atlanta Police \u2014 for their roles in the investigation.",
      "Fair also credited media coverage and public engagement for keeping attention on the case.",
      "\"He was bombarded on the news for months on end,\" Fair said. \"The media was a huge part of this capture. It kept him on the run and probably pretty tired all summer.\"",
      "Jail records in Fulton County, Georgia, show Groves was booked on fugitive from justice charges. Groves is expected to be extradited to Louisiana, where he will face additional charges related to the escape. Fair said Louisiana State Police are likely to lead that transfer.",
      "\"We're just happy nobody got injured,\" Fair said. \"All 10 of the escapees are back in custody, and we're proud of that success.\"",

      "The couple had three children together, Kara, Ted Jr., and former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy.",
      "Her tumultuous marriage to Kennedy, which began in 1958 and ended in 1982, made her an international celebrity. Her life post-divorce as a music scholar and performer and advocate on issues of addiction and mental health cemented her status as an important figure in American life.",
      "She was open and eloquent about her battles with alcoholism and depression in an era when celebrity confessionals were rare, and inspired the impactful post-politics career of her son Patrick, one of the nation's premiere crusaders for mental health services.",
      "\"Besides being a loving mother, talented musician, and instrumental partner to my father as he launched his successful political career, Mom was a powerful example to millions of people with mental health conditions,\" said Patrick in a statement Wednesday. \"She will be missed not just by the entire Kennedy Family, but by the arts community in the City of Boston and the many people whose lives that she touched.\"",

Many factors played into that outcome, including voters' judgment that Markey deserved re-election. But it was also a statement that many voters either no longer remembered the golden era of the Kennedy brothers' rise to power and/or no longer valued the centrist progressivism espoused by young Joe. As Markey put it in a campaign video: \"We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it's time to start asking what your country can do for you.\"",

      "Speaking to reporters at a rally by federal workers in downtown Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, Pritzker shrugged off the president's comments.",
      "\"Look, he's a coward. He says a lot of things to the cameral. He likes to pretend to be a tough guy. Come and get me. Come and get me,\" Pritzker said. \"He's demented, literally; unhinged. This is somebody who is so insecure that he lashes out pretending that he can come arrest people for no reason at all. He can't. He isn't going to do it. TACO \u2013 Trump always chickens out.\"",
      "Johnson also had harsh words for the president.",
      "\"This president is unstable, unhinged, a double-minded individual that quite frankly is a threat to our democracy, and it's certainly not the first time that Donald Trump has called for the arresting of a Black man unjustly. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to stay firm as the mayor of this amazing city,\" Johnson said in an interview on CNN. \"We're going to defend all of Chicago.\"",
      "The president has repeatedly called both Johnson and Prizker weak, and has described Chicago as a crime hot spot, despite violent crime rates falling in the city.",
      "The two leaders also have sparred with Trump for weeks over his plan to send troops to Chicago.",
      "Approximately 200 Texas National Guard troops landed in the Chicago area on Tuesday, and another 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard also have been deployed for at least 60 days to protect federal agents and facilities in the Chicago area amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, despite objections from Pritzker and Johnson.",
      "\"This president is absolutely out of control, and it's incumbent on all of us, if there was ever a time for working people to unite in this country, now is the time,\" Johnson said.",
      "Pritzker has vowed to use \"every lever\" at the state's disposal to resist the troop deployment. The state and city of Chicago have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the troop deployment, and a federal judge is expected to rule Thursday on their request for a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's move.",
      "Arrests,\u00a0raids\u00a0and\u00a0protests\u00a0have become daily occurrences as the presence of ICE in Chicago has drastically increased since the Department of Homeland Security launched what it dubbed \"Operation Midway Blitz\" at the beginning of September.",
      "On Tuesday, Mayor Johnson signed an executive order prohibiting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies from using city property for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement.",
      "The order prohibits federal authorities from using city-owned or controlled parking lots, vacant lots and garages as staging areas, processing locations or operations bases for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement activity.",
      "Meanwhile, Pritzker has taken Mr. Trump to task repeatedly for his use of federal forces, and most recently for deploying National Guard troops to Illinois. The deployment comes amid clashes between demonstrators and federal agents outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois, where, within the past couple of weeks, over a dozen protesters were arrested.",
      "On Tuesday night, Pritzker also denounced federal immigration enforcement in Chicago.",
      "\"It is striking fear in the hearts of everybody in Chicago, and we have residents \u2014 this isn't just about undocumented people,\" Pritzker said Tuesday night during a discussion in Minnesota with that state's governor, Tim Walz. \"U.S. citizens who are brown or Black are being stopped only for that reason, and asked for identification that proves they're a U.S. citizen.\"",
      "Both governors said they believe the Trump administration is targeting blue states.",
      "Pritzker is also calling for governors nationwide to denounce the National Guard deployments. In a statement on social media, he said Illinois could withdraw from the National Governors Association over the issue.",
      "\"If the National Governors Association chooses to remain silent, Illinois will have no choice but to withdraw from the organization,\" Pritzker wrote. \"We should be standing as one against the idea that Donald Trump can call up the National Guard against our will.\"",
      "The National Governors Association represents governors from all 50 states and across the political spectrum. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also made the same threat.",
      "CBS News Chicago reached out to the White House to ask about the president's call for Pritzker and Johnson to be jailed, and what would warrant their arrest.",
      "\"JB Pritzker and Brandon Johnson have blood on their hands. These failed leaders have stood idly by while innocent Americans fall victim to violent crime time and time again,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"Instead of taking action to stop the crime, these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again.\"",
      "President Trump has for years called for his political opponents to be jailed, but the Department of Justice has recently acted on some of those calls, with former FBI Director James Comey facing federal charges for allegedly lying to Congress.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday issued an administrative stay of the Oregon federal judge's lower court order that blocked Mr. Trump's federalization of the Oregon National Guard. Immergut's order blocking the deployment of federalized troops was still in effect, however, because that order has not been appealed.",
      "\"In the circumstances here, granting an administrative stay will best preserve the status quo,\" the 9th Circuit said Wednesday. \"Prior to the October 4 temporary restraining order, Oregon National Guard members had been federalized but not deployed. The Memorandum authorized federalization of the Oregon National Guard members. An administrative stay of the October 4 temporary restraining order will maintain the federalization of Oregon National Guard members, because that order prohibits implementation of the Memorandum. Additionally, the second temporary restraining order has not been challenged or appealed, and it prohibits the deployment of National Guard members in Oregon. Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed.\"",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. \"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he wrote.",
      "The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.",
      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed a presidential memorandum\u00a0mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of the Tennessee governor.",
      "National Guard troops also deployed to Illinois",
      "The president has also ordered National Guard members from Texas to be deployed to Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday evening.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Pritzker said 400 members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the U.S.",

It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state's military troops,\" Pritzker said, calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for and to refuse to coordinate.",

      "The Texas bishop on the front lines of the U.S. immigration crackdown met Wednesday with Pope Leo XIV, bringing him a packet of letters from immigrant families \"terrorized\" by fear that they and their loved ones will be rounded up and deported as the Trump administration's tactics grow increasingly combative.",
      "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz also showed Leo a video detailing the plight of migrants, and told The Associated Press afterward that Leo vowed to \"stand with\" them and the Catholic leaders who are trying to help them.",
      "\"He had a few words for us, thanking us for our commitment to the immigrant peoples and also saying that he hopes that the bishops' conference will speak to this issue,\" said Seitz, chair of the migration committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
      "Leo, who was born in Chicago and is also a citizen of Peru, hasn't spoken much about U.S. politics since being named the leader of the Catholic Church, but recently pointed out what he sees as contradictions in debates around abortion, the death penalty and immigration.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" he said earlier this month. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\"We don't want to get into the political fray, we're not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\" and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",
      "\"They're terrorized. And it is a fear that has a long-term impact on people, on their lives,\" he said.",
      "The letters and video Seitz brought to Leo detail the fear that even legal migrants are facing every day. U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, immigration agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and put handcuffs on a city official at a hospital.",
      "\"They can't go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\" wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\"The pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he's doing to immigrants,\" she wrote. \"The pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he's doing.\"",
      "Just before he died, Pope Francis strongly rebuked the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.",
      "History's first U.S. pope has followed in Francis' line. Last weekend, Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, denouncing the \"coldness of indifference\" and the \"stigma of discrimination\" that migrants desperate to flee violence and suffering often face. Asked by reporters this week about the crackdown in Chicago, Leo declined to comment.",
      "Prior to becoming pope, Leo, or then-Cardinal Robert Prevost, often shared posts on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "On Wednesday, Leo was running late for the audience with Seitz and the delegation of around a dozen people, including members of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy group formed in partnership with the El Paso diocese. The delegation members assured Leo that they would stand with him as they chatted in a Vatican reception room.",
      "\"Later on in the meeting he said, 'I will stand with you,' so it was a beautiful little exchange,\" said Seitz.",
      "There are rumors in the Vatican that the pope may be considering a trip to the United States as early as next year, when the United States celebrates the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. President Trump has invited him.",
      "Francis famously celebrated Mass on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border in 2016, in Ciudad Juarez, with the liturgy beamed live into a stadium across the border in El Paso.",
      "Seitz was noncommittal when asked if Leo might visit the U.S. side of the border.",
      "\"Well, you know he'd be welcome,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:42:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:24:51 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey on Sept. 25 charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remained the only attorney listed as representing the U.S. until just before Comey appeared in federal court for the first time to enter a plea. Two assistant U.S. attorneys from North Carolina filed papers indicating they will be working on the case.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "The former FBI director pleaded not guilty during an arraignment before U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. The judge set a tentative trial date for Jan. 5, but Fitzgerald said he would file motions that aim to have the indictment tossed out on numerous grounds, including selective and vindictive prosecution. He will also challenge the validity of Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney, Fitzgerald previewed.",
      "Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the charges last year.",

      "Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing\u00a0five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats\u00a0to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for\u00a0Texas' recent redistricting, which favors Republicans in the midterms.",
      "Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an\u00a0independent redistricting commission.\u00a0Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.",
      "Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50.",
      "While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.",
      "What do you think of the governor's plan?",
      "Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would \"make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress.\"",
      "Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is \"totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal.\"",
      "\"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps,\" Hilton said. \"I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that.\"",
      "Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California,\" Calderon said.",
      "However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50. \u00a0\"She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.",
      "Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes.",
      "\"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn,\" he said. \"[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste.\"",
      "Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.",
      "\"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism,\" Ware said.",
      "While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort \"essential\" to prevent the manipulation of elections, \"as the president has asked the state of Texas to do.\"",
      "\"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census\u2026 And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation,\" Yee said. \"We have to fight that.\"",
      "Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter \"gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas.\"",
      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",

These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate\u00a0to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:19:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Active-duty troops and National Guard members on missions will continue to work with the promise of back pay after Congress passes legislation to fund the government.",
    "story": [
      "Congress failed to reach a funding deal by Wednesday morning's deadline, leading to a government shutdown that will force active-duty service members to continue to serve without pay until a deal is made.",
      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-does-congress-get-paid/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:19:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",

      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump has also proposed a peace plan for Israel and Gaza, and spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week. Still, he told CBS News in September 2025 that he is not seeking the prize.",
      "\"I have nothing to say about it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"All I can do is put out wars.\" He added, \"I don't seek attention. I just want to save lives.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Trump was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP.",

    "story": [
      "VoteVets, a liberal group that typically backs veterans running for office, is pouring $1 million into aggressive ad campaigns backing the Democratic candidates in Virginia's and New Jersey's gubernatorial contests with less than 30 days until Election Day.",
      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey, is a former Navy helicopter pilot. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for the same job in Virginia, was a CIA operations officer before entering politics.",
      "The $500,000-apiece ad campaigns, shared exclusively with CBS News ahead of their launch, take direct aim at the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, and the GOP candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears. VoteVets says both ads feature veterans of the armed services discussing economic difficulties and alleging a GOP governor would make things worse for them.",
      "\"After a decade of Coast Guard rescues, I came home to make a go of it. But Jersey is so damn expensive right now,\" a Coast Guard veteran says in the New Jersey ad. \"And Jack Ciattarelli will make it worse. He already voted to raise property taxes and was even talking about a 10% sales tax.\"",
      "Ciattarelli has pushed back on allegations that he supports raising the state's sales tax to 10%, a claim also made in ads paid for by his Democratic opponent's campaign. He says his comments were taken out of context.",
      "\"Mikie Sherrill and her allies are lying about Jack,\" a spokesperson for Ciattarelli said in a statement. \"As governor, he has a plan to cut taxes for working and middle class New Jerseyans, while Mikie Sherrill has a history of voting to raise taxes again and again in Congress.\"",
      "In the Virginia ad, a Navy veteran attempts to connect Earle-Sears to President Trump's economic policies, although she has not been endorsed by the president.",
      "\"Instead of fighting for Virginia, Winsome Earle-Seals went right along with the Trump budget that's raising our costs even higher,\" the veteran says in the ad. \"Health care. Housing. Electricity. And those tariffs, driving up prices on just about everything else.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears' campaigns for comment and will update this story if they respond.",
      "VoteVets placed a separate half-million-dollar ad campaign supporting Spanberger in August, and the group's political action committee directly invested another $500,000 into her campaign earlier in the cycle.",
      "VoteVets additionally transferred nearly $80,000 to the Democratic Party of New Jersey and launched a $100,000 cable ad buy in the contest for Virginia's 64th state House district.",
      "Virginia and New Jersey are two of the only states to hold statewide elections a year after the presidential race, so their gubernatorial contests are typically closely watched \u2014 and are often treated as referenda on the newly elected president.",
      "Both races have heated up significantly in recent weeks, with news stories threatening to upend the contests.",
      "In New Jersey, legal threats linger over the contest after CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives admitted to releasing a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to a Ciattarelli ally, including her Social Security number and other private information. Sherrill has alleged her records were released intentionally, which Ciatarelli's campaign has denied. Sherrill has also faced attacks from the right seeking to link her to the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal \u2014 she was not accused of cheating, and she says her only involvement was her failure to inform on her classmates.",
      "Meanwhile in Virginia, Spanberger has faced attacks after Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones admitted he sent text messages in 2022 that contained violent and inflammatory language about several Republicans.",
      "Spanberger condemned Jones's violent rhetoric, but she has faced criticism from the right for not calling on him to drop out of the race. Earle-Sears's campaign also released an ad connecting Spanberger to Jones.",

      "President Trump nominated Walker for the diplomatic post last year, after the retired running back entered the political fray by running as the Republican nominee in Georgia's 2022 Senate race. He lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock by 2.8 points in a runoff.",
      "Walker is the first Senate-confirmed ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade.",
      "Walker won the Heisman Trophy in 1982 with the University of Georgia Bulldogs, and played professionally for three years for the U.S. Football League's New Jersey Generals \u2014 a team that Mr. Trump bought toward the end of Walker's career with the upstart league. After the USFL folded, Walker played in the NFL for more than a decade.",
      "He ran for Senate three years ago with Mr. Trump's backing. Walker's campaign was dogged by accusations that he paid several women to get abortions in the 1990s and 2000s, despite his opposition to the procedure while on the campaign trail. Walker vehemently denied the allegations.",
      "Walker was also named to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition during Mr. Trump's first term, but was removed during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a December Truth Social post nominating Walker to the ambassador role.",
      "Walker and more than 100 other Trump nominees were confirmed Tuesday in a single 51-47 vote, part of a rules change by Senate Republicans that allows them to approve large groups of executive branch nominees \"en bloc\" with a simple majority rather than voting on them one by one. They changed the rules amid frustration that Democrats had slowed the nomination process to a crawl \u2014 though Democrats accused Republicans of going \"nuclear.\"",
      "Another high-profile nominee who was approved in Tuesday's package is former White House aide Sergio Gor for ambassador to India.",
      "The nominees were approved while the Senate remained at an impasse over the government shutdown. The body is expected to weigh competing Democratic and Republican proposals to reopen the government Wednesday \u2014 but both bills have been voted down multiple times.",

      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024.

      "More and more wild bears have been spotted in Japan in recent years, even in residential areas, due to factors including a declining human population and climate change.",
      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",

There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",

      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals.",

      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",

      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",

      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",

      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

      "Bill Nye and hundreds of others gathered at Capitol Hill on Monday to protest against the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA, arguing that Congress has an obligation to promote the progress of science.",
      "\"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration,\" if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",

That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",

    "summary": "Preparing for the threats of tomorrow, the U.S. Air Force is testing drones piloted by artificial intelligence alongside aircraft flown by humans \u2013 and is teaching AI how to fight, a potential revolution in warfare.",
    "story": [
      "At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a test bed for a new kind of air force, Major Trent McMullen is a fighter pilot learning to fly alongside the XQ-58, a drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Think of this as \"Top Gun AI.\"",
      "\"I've flown safety chase on it for several missions, messaging back and forth with the autonomy on board,\" said McMullen.",
      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",
      "He says AI drones are capable of doing that today \u2013 and those drones could be armed with weapons.",
      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat. Those aircraft still have a cockpit, and a pilot, who can engage the plug-and-play AI system, and then remain on board as a safety pilot.",
      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "\"Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] Officers!\" Mr. Trump posted. \"Governor Pritzker also!\"",
      "Speaking to reporters at a rally by federal workers in downtown Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, Pritzker shrugged off the president's comments.",
      "\"Look, he's a coward. He says a lot of things to the cameral. He likes to pretend to be a tough guy. Come and get me. Come and get me,\" Pritzker said. \"He's demented, literally; unhinged. This is somebody who is so insecure that he lashes out pretending that he can come arrest people for no reason at all. He can't. He isn't going to do it. TACO \u2013 Trump always chickens out.\"",
      "Johnson also had harsh words for the president.",
      "\"This president is unstable, unhinged, a double-minded individual that quite frankly is a threat to our democracy, and it's certainly not the first time that Donald Trump has called for the arresting of a Black man unjustly. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to stay firm as the mayor of this amazing city,\" Johnson said in an interview on CNN. \"We're going to defend all of Chicago.\"",
      "The president has repeatedly called both Johnson and Prizker weak, and has described Chicago as a crime hot spot, despite violent crime rates falling in the city.",
      "The two leaders also have sparred with Trump for weeks over his plan to send troops to Chicago.",
      "Approximately 200 Texas National Guard troops landed in the Chicago area on Tuesday, and another 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard also have been deployed for at least 60 days to protect federal agents and facilities in the Chicago area amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, despite objections from Pritzker and Johnson.",
      "\"This president is absolutely out of control, and it's incumbent on all of us, if there was ever a time for working people to unite in this country, now is the time,\" Johnson said.",
      "Pritzker has vowed to use \"every lever\" at the state's disposal to resist the troop deployment. The state and city of Chicago have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the troop deployment, and a federal judge is expected to rule Thursday on their request for a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's move.",
      "Arrests,\u00a0raids\u00a0and\u00a0protests\u00a0have become daily occurrences as the presence of ICE in Chicago has drastically increased since the Department of Homeland Security launched what it dubbed \"Operation Midway Blitz\" at the beginning of September.",
      "On Tuesday, Mayor Johnson signed an executive order prohibiting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies from using city property for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement.",
      "The order prohibits federal authorities from using city-owned or controlled parking lots, vacant lots and garages as staging areas, processing locations or operations bases for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement activity.",
      "Meanwhile, Pritzker has taken Mr. Trump to task repeatedly for his use of federal forces, and most recently for deploying National Guard troops to Illinois. The deployment comes amid clashes between demonstrators and federal agents outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois, where, within the past couple of weeks, over a dozen protesters were arrested.",
      "On Tuesday night, Pritzker also denounced federal immigration enforcement in Chicago.",
      "\"It is striking fear in the hearts of everybody in Chicago, and we have residents \u2014 this isn't just about undocumented people,\" Pritzker said Tuesday night during a discussion in Minnesota with that state's governor, Tim Walz. \"U.S. citizens who are brown or Black are being stopped only for that reason, and asked for identification that proves they're a U.S. citizen.\"",
      "Both governors said they believe the Trump administration is targeting blue states.",
      "Pritzker is also calling for governors nationwide to denounce the National Guard deployments. In a statement on social media, he said Illinois could withdraw from the National Governors Association over the issue.",
      "\"If the National Governors Association chooses to remain silent, Illinois will have no choice but to withdraw from the organization,\" Pritzker wrote. \"We should be standing as one against the idea that Donald Trump can call up the National Guard against our will.\"",
      "The National Governors Association represents governors from all 50 states and across the political spectrum. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also made the same threat.",
      "CBS News Chicago reached out to the White House to ask about the president's call for Pritzker and Johnson to be jailed, and what would warrant their arrest.",
      "\"JB Pritzker and Brandon Johnson have blood on their hands. These failed leaders have stood idly by while innocent Americans fall victim to violent crime time and time again,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"Instead of taking action to stop the crime, these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again.\"",
      "President Trump has for years called for his political opponents to be jailed, but the Department of Justice has recently acted on some of those calls, with former FBI Director James Comey facing federal charges for allegedly lying to Congress.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday issued an administrative stay of the Oregon federal judge's lower court order that blocked Mr. Trump's federalization of the Oregon National Guard. Immergut's order blocking the deployment of federalized troops was still in effect, however, because that order has not been appealed.",
      "\"In the circumstances here, granting an administrative stay will best preserve the status quo,\" the 9th Circuit said Wednesday. \"Prior to the October 4 temporary restraining order, Oregon National Guard members had been federalized but not deployed. The Memorandum authorized federalization of the Oregon National Guard members. An administrative stay of the October 4 temporary restraining order will maintain the federalization of Oregon National Guard members, because that order prohibits implementation of the Memorandum. Additionally, the second temporary restraining order has not been challenged or appealed, and it prohibits the deployment of National Guard members in Oregon. Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed.\"",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. \"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he wrote.",
      "The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.",
      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.",

      "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz also showed Leo a video detailing the plight of migrants, and told The Associated Press afterward that Leo vowed to \"stand with\" them and the Catholic leaders who are trying to help them.",
      "\"He had a few words for us, thanking us for our commitment to the immigrant peoples and also saying that he hopes that the bishops' conference will speak to this issue,\" said Seitz, chair of the migration committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
      "Leo, who was born in Chicago and is also a citizen of Peru, hasn't spoken much about U.S. politics since being named the leader of the Catholic Church, but recently pointed out what he sees as contradictions in debates around abortion, the death penalty and immigration.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" he said earlier this month. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\"We don't want to get into the political fray, we're not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\" and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",
      "\"They're terrorized. And it is a fear that has a long-term impact on people, on their lives,\" he said.",

U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, immigration agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and put handcuffs on a city official at a hospital.",
      "\"They can't go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\" wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\"The pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he's doing to immigrants,\" she wrote. \"The pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he's doing.\"",
      "Just before he died, Pope Francis strongly rebuked the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.",
      "History's first U.S. pope has followed in Francis' line. Last weekend, Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, denouncing the \"coldness of indifference\" and the \"stigma of discrimination\" that migrants desperate to flee violence and suffering often face. Asked by reporters this week about the crackdown in Chicago, Leo declined to comment.",
      "Prior to becoming pope, Leo, or then-Cardinal Robert Prevost, often shared posts on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "On Wednesday, Leo was running late for the audience with Seitz and the delegation of around a dozen people, including members of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy group formed in partnership with the El Paso diocese. The delegation members assured Leo that they would stand with him as they chatted in a Vatican reception room.",
      "\"Later on in the meeting he said, 'I will stand with you,' so it was a beautiful little exchange,\" said Seitz.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-is-the-price-of-gold-rising-4000-ounce-economy/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:42:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:24:51 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey on Sept. 25 charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remained the only attorney listed as representing the U.S. until just before Comey appeared in federal court for the first time to enter a plea. Two assistant U.S. attorneys from North Carolina filed papers indicating they will be working on the case.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "The former FBI director pleaded not guilty during an arraignment before U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. The judge set a tentative trial date for Jan. 5, but Fitzgerald said he would file motions that aim to have the indictment tossed out on numerous grounds, including selective and vindictive prosecution. He will also challenge the validity of Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney, Fitzgerald previewed.",
      "Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the charges last year.",

      "Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount. The analysis fills a gap left by the lack of DHS reporting on how many arrests ICE has made in or around courts.",
      "Those arrested very rarely had criminal records, the analysis found. Over 90% had only civil immigration charges, such as crossing the border illegally.",
      "ICE did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the analysis, but Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release that \"arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense.\"",
      "\"It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be,\" she said. \"These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.\"",
      "To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ICE data does not have precise location information on arrests. But by comparing dates, places and demographic information between the two datasets, Gunther compiled a list of arrests that likely took place on the same day as a court hearing. The methodology was reviewed by two immigration experts.",
      "\"These are the first general estimates of something that shouldn't be secret in the first place,\" Gunther said. \"It shouldn't be necessary at all to do this drawn-out data analysis to know such basic facts.\"",
      "ICE began making arrests at immigration courts in late May, when DHS rescinded Biden-era guidance limiting them.",
      "DHS attorneys then began moving to dismiss cases and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Once immigrants face expedited removal, they are detained and are not entitled to any more hearings before a judge.",
      "Previously, expedited removal had been mostly limited to migrants encountered near the border. In January, the Trump administration expanded that to apply to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who entered less than two years ago.",
      "On Aug. 30, a federal judge paused this expansion, blocking ICE's strategy of fast-tracking deportations of those with dismissed cases.",
      "ICE is also arresting immigrants in court with ongoing cases, immigration attorneys and court watchers said.",
      "\"A lot of immigration judges say, I'm going to give you another court date, but I don't know what will happen when you leave this court room,\" said Dee Ann Croucher, a volunteer who observes hearings in El Paso multiple times a week. \"I saw a lady just break down sobbing when they said that to her.\"",
      "The woman was detained in the hallway after the hearing, Croucher said.",
      "Immigrants arrested in court are often transferred far from home and family, limiting access to legal representation and sometimes placing them in a more conservative court system, immigration attorneys said.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the arrests Gunther identified found that nearly all were transferred to another facility, often hundreds of miles away. Those arrested in New York were moved an average of more than 1,000 miles away, often to Texas or Louisiana.",
      "Some have been released from detention after federal judges ruled their detainment was unlawful, but not everyone has the legal resources to file a petition, said Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "\"Many people are languishing in detention,\" he said. \"Because detention is so terrible, people are often giving up and just saying, \"You know what? Just give me a deportation order.\"",
      "In Miami, some are choosing to self-deport after ICE arrested them in court, said Miami immigration attorney Antonio Ramos, whose office is in the same building as the court.",
      "Miami's immigration court sees the second-most hearings for non-detained immigrants, following New York. There have been about a third of estimated in-court arrests in Miami than in New York this year, according to the analysis.",
      "New York City's immigration courts see more non-detained hearings than any other city. Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.",
      "\"I've had officials tell me this to my face that they are punishing New York,\" she said. \"They would say, when New York stops being a sanctuary city, that is when we will leave.\"",
      "DHS has been clear that New York and other cities with sanctuary policies will be the target of increased enforcement, but did not respond to inquiries from CBS News about how they choose which courts to deploy ICE officers to.",
      "Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court. Immigration courts in the Los Angeles area \u2014 within the city itself and in Van Nuys and Santa Ana \u2014 also had a high number of estimated arrests when combined, at 282.",
      "Immigration advocates who observed the arrests in El Paso's court described a less hostile atmosphere and no instances of excessive force. In one case, volunteers were able to negotiate with ICE agents to allow a noncitizen with a medical disorder to be electronically monitored instead of being detained, said Emily Miller, program manager at the Border Immigration Law and Justice Center in El Paso.",
      "\"We have developed a cordial relationship with ICE,\" said Miller, who helps coordinate a group of volunteer court watchers. \"Whether we agree with what [ICE is] doing or not, there is no yelling and filming taking place anymore. At the beginning, there was yelling and filming, we saw ICE be more forceful, that has stopped.\"",
      "Twenty-one of the arrests in El Paso were of children who were arrested with their family members, the analysis estimated. It identifies a total of 76 children arrested, almost all in Texas or the Los Angeles area, and none in New York.",
      "The Biden-era memo had prohibited courthouse arrests because it would \"disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings.\" When a noncitizen does not appear for their hearing, an immigration judge may order them removed \"in absentia.\"",
      "Immigrants face \"an impossible catch 22,\" said Amy Belsher, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union: show up to court and risk arrest, or stay home and receive a deportation order.",
      "The rate of \"in absentia\" removal orders have ticked upward from 46% of non-detained case completions in May, when the arrests first started, to 52% in August.",
      "\"It's going to do lasting and irreparable harm to noncitizens' trust in government systems,\" Belsher said.",

      "David Linder, 39, Charles Eppard, 39, and Jeremy Leif, 38, were heliskiing together on March 4 when they were swept away by an avalanche. Rescue efforts began immediately. The men appeared to be buried under between 40 and 100 feet of snow at the bottom of a steep slope. The snow's depth and ongoing avalanche danger made it too hazardous for recovery teams to operate in the area.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela.",
      "Democrats forced a vote on the issue under the War Powers Act. In a 48-51 vote, the effort failed to garner enough support to move forward.",
      "The resolution, led by Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia, would have blocked the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with \"any non-state organization engaged in the promotion, trafficking, and distribution of illegal drugs and other related activities\" without congressional authorization.",
      "\"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way,\" Schiff said Wednesday, saying the strikes risk escalating into a full-blown conflict with Venezuela. \"I feel it is plainly unconstitutional.\"",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean Sea have prompted bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers questioning their legality. Congress, which has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration says it has conducted four strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela since Sept. 2, killing at least 21 people.",
      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans, told reporters the president has the authority to order the strikes without congressional authorization.",
      "\"These are targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" he said.",
      "Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project, said, \"The situation in the Caribbean is not that.\"",
      "Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations \"provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state.\"",
      "Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them.",
      "\"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization,\" Kaine said. \"These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress \u2014 not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped \u2014 unless authorized by congressional action.\"",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",
      "\"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,\" Paul wrote.",
      "Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us now there names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case.\"",
      "Schiff said Congress has abdicated its war-declaring responsibilities because members don't want to go on the record on the issue. He said that sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "\"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore,\" Schiff said. \"What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action?

      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Two regional sources told CBS News there is an agreement on all sides in principle on a hostage release, but procedural issues remain. Once those details are handled, it will be 48 hours before any release starts, sources said.",
      "A senior White House official said the hostages could be released on Monday. The deal will go to Israel's cabinet for approval on Thursday, and if it votes yes, the Israeli military will need to withdraw to an agreed-upon line in the Gaza Strip, which should take under 24 hours. Then Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the official said.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also released a short statement on the hostages that read, \"With God's help we will bring them all home.\"",

      "In his earlier Truth Social post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"All Parties will be treated fairly!\"",
      "The announcement came just hours after Mr. Trump said he may travel to the Middle East this weekend, and was open to potentially traveling to the Gaza Strip.",
      "During an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump read a note that was passed to him by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The president said Rubio's note said negotiators were \"pretty close to a deal,\" and that they would \"need him\" pretty quickly.",
      "A little over a week ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan at a White House meeting with Netanyahu, who expressed his full support for the proposal.",

      "The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",

      "Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.",
      "Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal \u2014 including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza. But the group had said other parts of the plan needed to be further negotiated.",

      "The staggering death toll does not reflect the thousands more children who have been maimed and injured, or those who have lost one or both parents during the war.",
      "At a makeshift camp for Palestinian orphans in the southern city of Khan Younis, CBS News' team in Gaza saw some of the young faces behind the grim statistics.",
      "\"I wish the war were just a dream I'd wake up from and see my parents next to me,\" said 14-year-old Deena Al-Za'arab, who lost both of her parents.",
      "\"I have to keep it together for the sake of my siblings,\" she added, \"because now I must raise them.\"",
      "Many of the children at the camp now spend their days doing the work of adults.",
      "Arat Awqal, who is just 10, promised her father she'd be a doctor before he died, but she now focuses on taking care of her younger sister.",
      "\"I just want to go back to how it used to be,\" she told CBS News. \"Whenever we heard the sound of missiles my father would hold us, but now he's gone, and we are always scared.\"",
      "UNICEF says one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and Elder stressed that the trauma being inflicted on the youngest is not just physical.",
      "\"The kids not only lost loved ones \u2014 it's not just about just having your mother killed, it's about watching your mother die, then add that level of trauma to being displaced \u2014 and we talk of displacement, it sounds like a neutral or abstract term. It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",
      "\"There have been several hundred thousands of people who have moved from the north recently, in the last few weeks,\" Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CBS News' Haley Ott on Wednesday.",
      "\"The situation was already very crowded,\" she said, speaking on the phone from central Gaza. \"They are now even more so. You can see a lot of people living on the side of the road, pitching tents on the sides of the roads \u2026 There are many people who fled on foot and, of course, were not able to bring anything with them, and this creates extremely difficult conditions in terms of hygiene, sanitation and these kinds of things.\"",
      "At the camp for the orphans \u2014 all of them among the displaced \u2014 12-year-old Gazal Basam told CBS News she felt \"such pain in my heart after losing my dad.\"",

      "The Texas bishop on the front lines of the U.S. immigration crackdown met Wednesday with Pope Leo XIV, bringing him a packet of letters from immigrant families \"terrorized\" by fear that they and their loved ones will be rounded up and deported as the Trump administration's tactics grow increasingly combative.",
      "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz also showed Leo a video detailing the plight of migrants, and told The Associated Press afterward that Leo vowed to \"stand with\" them and the Catholic leaders who are trying to help them.",
      "\"He had a few words for us, thanking us for our commitment to the immigrant peoples and also saying that he hopes that the bishops' conference will speak to this issue,\" said Seitz, chair of the migration committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
      "Leo, who was born in Chicago and is also a citizen of Peru, hasn't spoken much about U.S. politics since being named the leader of the Catholic Church, but recently pointed out what he sees as contradictions in debates around abortion, the death penalty and immigration.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" he said earlier this month. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\"We don't want to get into the political fray, we're not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\" and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",
      "\"They're terrorized. And it is a fear that has a long-term impact on people, on their lives,\" he said.",
      "The letters and video Seitz brought to Leo detail the fear that even legal migrants are facing every day. U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, immigration agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and put handcuffs on a city official at a hospital.",
      "\"They can't go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\" wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\"The pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he's doing to immigrants,\" she wrote. \"The pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he's doing.\"",
      "Just before he died, Pope Francis strongly rebuked the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.",
      "History's first U.S. pope has followed in Francis' line. Last weekend, Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, denouncing the \"coldness of indifference\" and the \"stigma of discrimination\" that migrants desperate to flee violence and suffering often face. Asked by reporters this week about the crackdown in Chicago, Leo declined to comment.",
      "Prior to becoming pope, Leo, or then-Cardinal Robert Prevost, often shared posts on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "On Wednesday, Leo was running late for the audience with Seitz and the delegation of around a dozen people, including members of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy group formed in partnership with the El Paso diocese. The delegation members assured Leo that they would stand with him as they chatted in a Vatican reception room.",
      "\"Later on in the meeting he said, 'I will stand with you,' so it was a beautiful little exchange,\" said Seitz.",
      "There are rumors in the Vatican that the pope may be considering a trip to the United States as early as next year, when the United States celebrates the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. President Trump has invited him.",
      "Francis famously celebrated Mass on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border in 2016, in Ciudad Juarez, with the liturgy beamed live into a stadium across the border in El Paso.",
      "Seitz was noncommittal when asked if Leo might visit the U.S. side of the border.",

Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.",
      "\"A turning point\" for global fossil fuel power generation",
      "The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power \u2014 even as demand for electricity skyrockets \u2014 with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.",
      "\"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,\" said Ma\u0142gorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.",
      "At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.",
      "\"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,\" said Wiatros-Motyka. \"This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.\"",
      "The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.",

      "China and India leading the green energy transition",
      "Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.",
      "In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.",
      "India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.",
      "In both nations, emissions fell.",
      "\"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,\" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. \"This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.\"",
      "U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase",
      "In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.",
      "The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.",

      "Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",

      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",
      "Also on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.",
      "A Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.",
      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals.",

      "President Trump hopes to join the exclusive list of presidents and vice presidents who have received one of the world's most prestigious honors: the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday.",
      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",
      "Here's what to know about the Nobel Peace Prize and if Mr. Trump could receive it:",
      "When is the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "The 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, Oct. 10 at 5 a.m. ET. It will be awarded on Dec. 10 at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Norway.",
      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump has also proposed a peace plan for Israel and Gaza, and spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week. Still, he told CBS News in September 2025 that he is not seeking the prize.",
      "\"I have nothing to say about it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"All I can do is put out wars.\" He added, \"I don't seek attention. I just want to save lives.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Trump was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP.",

    "summary": "Fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago are fearing that a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean could kill them and their livelihoods.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Kenrick Modie finished untangling his fishing net in a quiet Caribbean village.",
      "As he slipped into a hammock at his home overlooking the sea, he worried that his life and livelihood could be wiped out by a U.S. military strike.",
      "Modie lives in the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which is now entangled in a geopolitical face-off between the United States and Venezuela, just 11 miles away.",
      "U.S. President Trump \"is giving instructions to shoot and kill people,\" Modie said about recent U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean as it bulks up its military presence in the region. \"What could we do? We're just a little dot.\"",
      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",
      "\"Just praying that everything works out with this situation with Venezuela and the U.S.,\" he said. \"That they make peace and not war.\"",

      "After some research, he discovered the NVG-291 trial and was considered a viable candidate, he told Fox News Digital.",

      "How the drug works",
      "In a separate interview with Fox News Digital, lead researcher Dr. Monica Perez, scientific chair at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago and professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern University, said the drug was first tested on animals, which displayed improved locomotor function (movement).",
      "The researchers then conducted a randomized clinical trial in humans, in which half of the participants received the NVG-291 drug, which contained a repair molecule to improve nervous system function.",
      "NVG-291 is a peptide drug that contains a repair molecule to improve nervous system function. (iStock)",
      "The drug is a peptide, which is a small protein that works like a roadblock remover. After a spinal cord injury, the body sends out signals that tell nerve fibers to stop growing. This drug blocks those signals, so the nerves have a better chance to regrow.",
      "\"This peptide can block those inhibitory signals,\" Ryan said. \"There is a little bit of evidence in animals that it can actually enhance the growth of neurons.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Although GLP-1 receptor agonists, best known for weight loss and diabetes treatment, are a peptide, Perez said this spinal cord injury treatment works differently.",
      "\"It has a specific mechanism, and it's more related to repair, to try to enhance the growth of neurons that are affected by central nervous system injury,\" she said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Spinal cord injuries are typically approached with cell therapies, like stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells, Perez noted.",
      "This peptide approach, in contrast, is \"easy to administer,\" can be done at home, achieves a \"similar goal\" and is \"extremely safe,\" she added.",
      "Researchers observed \"electrophysiological changes\" in the group that received the experimental medication. (iStock)",
      "Perez said more research is necessary to determine how long the effects of this drug will last.",
      "\"We observed strong electrophysiological changes in the group that received the medication compared to the placebo group, but we don't have follow-up measurements,\" she said. \"There's no way for us to understand the real duration of these treatments.\"",
      "As there is not currently an FDA-approved treatment for spinal cord injuries, Perez said that those involved with this research are \"very devoted\" to advancing this science.",

      "While each patient may react differently, Williams said he would recommend this treatment to other people with spinal cord injuries.",

      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies.

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "Even trained doctors can struggle with intubation. (Universal Images Group/Getty Images)",
      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

      "The results are eye-opening:",
      "Experts had a 100% success rate.Paramedics and EMTs reached a 96% success rate with just five minutes of training.Non-experts placed the tube in an average of 21 seconds, less than half the time needed with advanced video laryngoscopes.",

These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money.

      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines.

Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",

Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney.

      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Even Apple\u2019s built-in protections can miss new or advanced threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if your Mac is already infected",
      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",

      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",

      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt the CyberGuy reports on how Instagram safety tools are not 'foolproof' for kids, shares tips for how to protect teens online and more on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Meta is rolling out new protections aimed at making social media safer for young people. In September 2024, Instagram introduced Teen Accounts, which come with built-in safeguards that limit who can contact teens, what content they see and how long they spend on the app.",
      "Since then, adoption has been strong: 97% of teens ages 13-15 kept the default settings, and 94% of parents say Teen Accounts are helpful. Now, Meta is expanding those protections beyond Instagram. Teen Accounts are coming to Facebook and Messenger worldwide, bringing stronger safety standards to more of the apps teens use every day.",

      "However, not everyone agrees that these protections go far enough.\u00a0Research regarding the effectiveness of Instagram's teen safety features, as reported by child-safety advocacy groups and corroborated by researchers at Northeastern University (Sept. 25, 2025), paints a different picture. The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night.

By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",

      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms.

      "\"There needs to be an element of confidentiality of the evidence in order to protect the jury pool,\" Spencer stated. \"If the prosecutor or the defense is leaking quote-unquote evidence to the public... that may inhibit Tyler's right to a fair trial.\"",

      "While it\u2019s too early to know exactly which direction Robinson\u2019s legal team will take, Spencer outlined a few possibilities.",
      "\"There perhaps could be a factual innocence defense being raised indicating that Tyler wasn\u2019t actually the shooter,\" he said. \"Probably more likely the defense\u2026 is addressing the aggravating factor\u2026 whether the defendant\u2019s alleged actions had a high probability of causing the death of someone other than Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Such a strategy could reduce the charge from capital homicide to standard murder \u2014 a significant difference in potential sentencing, he noted.",

      "New York Post columnist Douglas Murray discusses the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack and the state of peace talks between Israel and Hamas on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019",
      "As\u00a0President Donald Trump moves to finalize his 20-point plan to end the Gaza war, Israel faces a pivotal decision that could reshape the conflict\u2019s aftermath. The framework envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all hostages, and a major prisoner exchange. In return, Hamas would commit to disarmament and allow a technocratic transitional authority to manage Gaza\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "Part of the agreement involves releasing hundreds of convicted Palestinian terrorists, a clause that has already triggered backlash from the families of victims.",
      "Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Moshe Dayan Forum at Tel Aviv University and one of Israel\u2019s foremost experts on Hamas, told Fox News Digital that the list of roughly 250 prisoners contains names that represent what he called \"a real strategic danger.\"",
      "TRUMP UNVEILS 20-POINT PLAN TO SECURE PEACE IN GAZA, INCLUDING GRANTING SOME HAMAS MEMBERS 'AMNESTY",
      "Palestinian Hamas terrorists stand guard on the day of the handover of hostages held in Gaza since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack, as part of a ceasefire and a hostages-prisoners swap deal between Hamas and Israel, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 22, 2025.\u00a0 (Reuters/Hatem Khaled/File Photo)",
      "\"These are not low-level activists,\" Milshtein said. \"Among them are people who built power and influence inside prison. When released, they will return as leaders.\"",
      "He cited several examples that, he said, demonstrate the risk of past exchanges. Among the prisoners now under discussion are Abbas al-Sayed, convicted for the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya that killed 30 people; Ibrahim Hamed, former Hamas military commander in the West Bank, serving more than 40 life sentences; Abdullah Barghouti, who produced explosives for a series of large-scale suicide bombings and Hassan Salameh, convicted for orchestrating multiple bus attacks in the 1990s.",
      "Ibrahim Hamed, a former head of the Hamas terrorist movement in the West Bank, looks on as he arrives for sentencing at the Ofer military court near Ramallah, West Bank, on July 1, 2012. The Israeli military court sentenced Hamed to 54 life terms after convicting him of ordering attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, the army said.",
      "\"These are people with dozens of life sentences,\" Milshtein explained. \"We\u2019ve already seen what happens when such figures are freed. Many of those who carried out the Oct. 7 massacre were prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal.\"",
      "ISRAELI VICTIMS OF TERROR CONCERNED WITH MURDERERS' RELEASE FROM PRISON, RELIEVED 7 HOSTAGES BACK HOME",
      "Milshtein noted that several\u00a0recently released prisoners have quickly rejoined Hamas\u2019s leadership abroad. He pointed to Abdel Nasser Issa, a Hamas operative convicted in 1995 who was released earlier this year and soon relocated to Turkey, where he began appearing in podcasts as part of the group\u2019s senior political echelon. \"That is the model,\" Milshtein said. \"They enter prison as operatives and emerge as decision-makers.\"",
      "Among the most concerning names, he added, is Jamal Al-Hur, who he described as \"one of the five most dangerous.\" Al-Hur, deeply connected to Hamas\u2019s hierarchy, has served nearly three decades in prison and now acts as a key liaison between jailed operatives and the group\u2019s external leadership. \"He didn\u2019t enter as a leader but became one inside,\" Milshtein said. \"If released, he will re-establish himself quickly\u2014just as others did before him.\"",

      "The inclusion of Al-Hur on the draft list has renewed anguish for the family of Sharon Edri, the Israeli soldier he helped kidnap, torture, and murder in 1996. Al-Hur was also convicted for the 1997 Apropo Caf\u00e9 bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 13 civilians. Twice before, his name appeared on proposed release lists and was removed after public pressure.",
      "\"I know what it\u2019s like not to know where your brother is for seven months,\" said Danielle Edry Karten, Edri\u2019s sister, who lives in New York. \"There\u2019s nothing that makes me happier than knowing families will soon be reunited with\u00a0the hostages. But this man shouldn\u2019t be released\u2014not because of my brother alone, but because of the danger he still poses.\"",
      "Sharon Edri is seen here with his sister, Danielle Edri Karten. Edri Karten opposes the release of her brother's killer.",
      "\"He kidnapped, mutilated, tortured my uncle,\" said Izzy Karten, Edri\u2019s nephew, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital from New York. \"He went to jail, was released, and went on to commit the Apropo Caf\u00e9 bombing. Later, he helped organize the kidnapping of the three boys that started the 2014 war. Now he\u2019s a senior Hamas leader inside prison\u2014that\u2019s why we call him the next Sinwar.\"",

      "At Sharon Edri\u2019s funeral nearly three decades ago, Netanyahu vowed to the family, \"We are telling the killers\u2014you won\u2019t break the people and the family.

      "\"It would take little for it to work,\" Lecornu said in his resignation speech. \"By being more selfless for many, by knowing how to show humility. One must always put one\u2019s country before one\u2019s party.\"",

      "A decision to invoke the act is not expected to be imminent, a senior administration official said. Were it to happen, it would be a notable escalation. The guard is currently deployed in limited support roles since active-duty members of the military are forbidden from conducting civilian law enforcement actions, such as conducting searches and making arrests. But the Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy troops inside the United States for that purpose.",
      "Trump\u2019s plans to deploy the National Guard have occasionally hit legal hurdles. A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday blocked him from sending guard members from any state to Portland. The next day, Trump said publicly that he would invoke the Insurrection Act \u201cif it was necessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I\u2019d do that,\u201d Trump said. As of now, he said, it has not been needed.",
      "Talk inside the White House about invoking the act has ebbed and flowed since Trump took office again in January, said the five people, who include the senior administration official, two people familiar with the discussions and two people close to the White House.",
      "But the debate inside the administration has shifted recently, from whether it makes sense to invoke the act to more deeply exploring how and when it might be invoked, both people close to the White House said.",
      "Administration officials have drafted legal defenses and various options for invoking the act, two of the people said.",
      "But the current, broad consensus among Trump\u2019s aides has been to exhaust all other options before taking that step, the senior administration official and one of the people close to the White House said.",
      "The person close to the White House described the process as working its way up \u201can escalatory ladder.\u201d",
      "Asked about discussions regarding invoking the Insurrection Act, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \u201cThe Trump administration is committed to restoring law and order in American cities that are plagued by violence due to Democrat mismanagement. And President Trump will not stand by while violent rioters attack federal law enforcement officers. The administration will work to protect federal assets and officers while making American cities safe again.\u201d",
      "The act gives the president broad discretion regarding its invocation. It can be invoked at the request of a state or when the president determines that conditions like \u201cunlawful obstructions,\u201d \u201crebellion\u201d or \u201cinsurrection\u201d have made it difficult to enforce the law. During the Civil Rights era, three presidents \u2014 Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson \u2014 used the act to protect activists or enforce court orders mandating desegregation. It was last used, at the request of California\u2019s governor, during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.",
      "The governors of Oregon and Illinois both oppose sending troops to their states. There are no riots, and authorities there are not defying court orders.",
      "The White House expects that any potential invocation of the act would be met with swift legal challenges and ultimately land at the Supreme Court.",
      "Last month, a federal judge ruled that the White House\u2019s deployment of active-duty troops to Los Angeles in June was illegal under the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law that prevents the military from being used as police. After that decision, administration officials revived discussions and internal legal analyses around invoking the Insurrection Act, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions and one person close to the White House.",
      "But Trump was cautioned that doing so under current circumstances might not hold up in the Supreme Court, which would break his series of victories there, these people said, and the idea was tabled for a time.",
      "A White House official declined to discuss specific deliberations but said Trump\u2019s legal team is focused on charting a legal pathway that can withstand judicial scrutiny.",
      "\u201cUltimately it\u2019s the president\u2019s vision and the president\u2019s policies that he got elected to implement that the attorneys are just working hard to defend,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to look at the law and say, \u2018How do we achieve the president\u2019s vision?\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump considered invoking the act in his first term during the protests after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in 2020. He declined despite the urging of some allies and later regretted that decision, according to the senior administration official. He is viewing his current decision through that lens, the senior administration official said.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s deputy chiefs of staff, Stephen Miller, has been a leading and longtime proponent of invoking the Insurrection Act. Miller has been at the center of discussions about the issue since Trump took office, said the five sources and another person familiar with the discussions.",
      "Administration officials have discussed invoking the act if local law enforcement authorities cannot or will not protect ICE and federal law enforcement agents, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "But one concern that some officials have raised is that invoking the act could eventually lead to pitting active-duty U.S. troops against other Americans, this person said.",
      "Trump has stepped up his use of the word \u201cinsurrection\u201d to describe developments in Portland and Chicago in recent days. On Monday he said the pushback against ICE agents\u2019 attempts to carry out immigration enforcement operations in both cities is \u201ccriminal insurrection.\u201d",
      "Trump and Miller have described the protesters against ICE operations in Chicago and Portland as participating in organized violence against the federal government.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to carry out insurrection against the federal government by using force, obstructive force, to keep ICE officers from going out and conducting arrests,\u201d Miller told reporters Monday. \u201cThis is an all-out campaign of insurrection against the sovereignty of the United States because the Democrat Party and those who are committing violence in this country do not believe in legitimacy of the sovereign territory of the United States.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The IRS said it is placing more than 34,000 employees, or about 46% of its workforce, on furlough starting Wednesday as the government shutdown stretches into its second week.",
      "The agency will also temporarily pause many taxpayer services, such as answering phone calls. The independent Taxpayer Advocate Service will also cease operations because of the lapse in funding.",
      "The IRS added that most administrative functions will also come to a halt, as will many planning activities.",
      "\"Today, due to the government shutdown the American people lost access to many vital services provided by the IRS when the agency furloughed thousands of employees,\" National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald said.",
      "Americans can expect longer wait times, delays in changes to the tax code and backlogs, she said. \"Taxpayers around the country will now have a much harder time getting the assistance they need, just as they get ready to file their extension returns due next week.\"",
      "Filing deadlines still apply for taxpayers during a government shutdown. Oct. 15 is the deadline for those who secured extensions on their 2024 taxes.",
      "Greenwald said many employees faced a \"lack of planning\" about their job status until supervisors and managers informed them of the furloughs Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis is not the way our government should treat its dedicated nonpartisan public servants,\u201d she added.",
      "Furloughs are temporary unpaid leave. Workers are expected to return to their roles once Congress replenishes government funding. Historically, workers who remain on the job can be unpaid but receive back pay once the shutdown is resolved.",
      "President Donald Trump and his administration have threatened permanent job cuts and back pay denials in addition to furloughs. On Tuesday, a draft White House memo came to light in which the administration argued that federal workers may not be entitled to back pay. It's unclear whether it's part of negotiating tactics, however.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "From the Gaza war to the Epstein files to the government shutdown, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has grown critical of her fellow Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "When the White House discouraged Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from launching a Senate bid in Georgia this spring, Greene \u2014 a longtime loyal ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 agreed to back off her statewide ambitions.",
      "But that didn\u2019t mean the firebrand Republican was going to back down from other fights she felt were worth waging \u2014 including, or perhaps especially, with her own party.",
      "Over the past six months, Greene has made waves in Washington for publicly breaking with Trump and the GOP on a number of high-profile issues and lobbing some pointed attacks at her fellow Republicans in the process. She was critical of the Trump administration\u2019s strikes on Iran, referred to the situation in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide,\u201d signed her name to an effort to force a House vote to require the Justice Department to release its files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case and, most recently, sided with Democrats in calling for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies amid the government shutdown fight.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not some sort of blind slave to the president, and I don\u2019t think anyone should be,\u201d Greene said in an interview. \u201cI serve in Congress. We\u2019re a separate branch of the government, and I\u2019m not elected by the president. I\u2019m not elected by anyone that works in the White House. I\u2019m elected by my district. That\u2019s who I work for, and I got elected without the president\u2019s endorsement, and, you know, I think that has served me really well.\u201d",
      "Greene won her first House primary in Georgia in 2020 without Trump\u2019s endorsement before she received his support in the general election in her deep-red district.",
      "\u201cSo I get to be independent as a Republican,\u201d she added, \u201cand I think what helps [Trump] the most is when he has people that are willing to be honest with him and not just tell him what they think he wants to hear.\u201d",
      "Greene denies that her statewide ambitions\u2019 being dashed has anything to do with her recent independent streak, saying that has always been her brand. She also slammed the Republican-led Senate, insisting she was never all that interested in serving there anyway, even though she had publicly talked about her desire to run.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to serve in that institution. Look at them. They\u2019re literally the reason why the government is shut down right now,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI think all good things go to die in the Senate, and I certainly don\u2019t want to go there. But I think those are just attacks to try to marginalize me or try to sweep me off, so to speak. And I really don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "While Greene has been a solo operator in the past, her recent behavior has surprised even some people who are close to her. She tried on the role of \u201cteam player\u201d for a while, especially when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was in charge. But she has grown increasingly disillusioned with politics and her own party, and she felt especially burned after the White House talked her out of running for the Senate, according to four Republican sources familiar with the matter.",
      "One of those sources, who is close to Greene \u2014 who openly expressed interest in becoming homeland security secretary \u2014 said she was also disappointed she didn\u2019t get a job in the Trump administration. Another one of the sources, who is also close to Greene and spoke to her recently, added that she has felt \u201cignored\u201d by GOP leadership and the White House.",
      "If Greene\u2019s intentions were to get Trump\u2019s attention, it appears to have worked. In recent months, he called at least two senior Republicans to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Marjorie?\u201d according to two GOP sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.",
      "Greene, who is arguably more in tune with the MAGA base than any other member of Congress, says she still supports Trump and maintains close ties with him. But her relationship with his staff is a different story.",
      "The White House has unsuccessfully tried to pressure Greene to remove her name from the Epstein discharge petition. Greene was particularly incensed when she read an anonymous White House official told reporters that supporting the petition would be seen as a \u201chostile act.\u201d She then went on Real America\u2019s Voice and called that official a \u201ccoward.\u201d",
      "In what some Republicans viewed as another sign of Greene\u2019s shifting attitude toward the political scene, she was invited last month to attend the grand opening of Trump\u2019s \u201cRose Garden Club\u201d at the White House, but she turned it down, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was the type of exclusive Trump event that Greene would normally have cleared her schedule to attend. Her office said she was under the weather.",
      "Greene also has a strained relationship with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whom she feels zero loyalty to and tried unsuccessfully to remove from his post last year over his support for Ukraine aid.",
      "Unlike McCarthy, who strategically brought Greene into the fold so he could better control her behavior, Johnson hasn\u2019t made the same overtures. Greene was a pariah when she first came to Congress for her incendiary rhetoric, so she was eager to prove herself and play the inside game. But now, she is increasingly embracing her outsider status.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t run for Congress as an establishment Republican, and when I ran for Congress, I\u2019d never even been to a GOP meeting. So I didn\u2019t come up through the ranks,\u201d Greene said. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand that. I\u2019m very much an average American. I don\u2019t see things through the party polls and the talking points; I look at the real problems and analyze them that way. ... So I think that helps me have a different viewpoint.\u201d",
      "In calling for an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies, Greene cited her own children as an example of how people are going to be hurt if Republicans let them lapse. Greene said she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the prospect even though she doesn\u2019t like the underlying law, and she criticized GOP leadership for not having a plan to address it.",
      "Democrats were quick to seize on her comments to bolster their argument. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cited them on the Senate floor, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., even put her social media post about the topic on a poster board and took it to a news conference.",
      "At his own news conference Tuesday, Johnson dismissed Greene\u2019s criticism of the party\u2019s approach on Obamacare subsidies, arguing she isn\u2019t informed about the topic.",
      "\u201cCongresswoman Greene does not serve on the committees of jurisdiction that deal with that, those specialized issues, and she\u2019s probably not read in on some of that,\u201d he said.",
      "But Greene hasn\u2019t budged in the face of criticism from party leadership.",
      "\u201cThe reality is they never talk about it, and that committee working on, say, health insurance and the industry, that doesn\u2019t happen in a [secure facility]; it\u2019s not a major secret,\u201d Greene said, adding that Johnson has yet to reach out to her to discuss her concerns.",
      "\u201cWhat I am upset over is my party has no solution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we talk about frequently, but it is a reality for Americans, and it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think we can ignore. I want, I really want to fix it.\u201d",
      "Now that she has given up on running for the Senate next year and was passed over for a Trump administration job, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s in store for Greene\u2019s political future. She raised $1.3 million in the first six months of the year, slightly less than the $1.9 million she had brought in at the same point in 2023, and she has only $641,000 cash on hand.",
      "Asked whether she\u2019s committed to running for re-election in the House next year, Greene said: \u201cOh, certainly. I haven\u2019t made any things like that. I don\u2019t, honestly, I don\u2019t even think about it. Right now, I\u2019m just like, damn it, why aren\u2019t we back at work?\u201d"

      "Flights were delayed across the country for a third straight day Wednesday as the Federal Aviation Administration contended with more airport staffing shortages amid the government shutdown.",
      "One of the airports hit with delays was Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, according to the FAA. The agency also ordered a reduction in the number of flights in and out of Orlando International Airport in Florida and Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the three major airports in the New York City metropolitan area.",
      "The staffing shortages began Monday, when air traffic controllers started working without pay because of the shutdown.",
      "Within the last 48 hours, delays from a lack of air traffic controllers have also been reported at airports in Boston; Burbank, California; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Las Vegas; Nashville, Tennessee; Philadelphia; and Phoenix, according to the FAA.",
      "The FAA reduces the number of flights in and out of airports when there are lower-than-ideal staffing levels to handle all the air traffic safely.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at Newark Airport that there had been a slight uptick in air traffic controllers calling out sick since the government shutdown began last week.",
      "\"Our priorities are safety,\" Duffy said at the time. \"And so, if we have additional sick calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that\u2019s safe for the American people.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement that it does not \"endorse, support, or condone\" federal employees from coordinating to affect flight safety or cause delays.",
      "\"Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\u201d the union posted on its website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA\u2019s credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News on Tuesday that a draft White House memo argues that furloughed federal workers are not entitled to back pay after the government shutdown lifts.",
      "However, some of the delays may be because of weather conditions on the East Coast. The next round of rain for the East Coast is set to arrive this weekend.",
      "On Tuesday evening, Nashville International Airport experienced delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA's website.",
      "The FAA added that more broadly, it \"will have limited communications but will send any significant safety messaging\" as a result of the shutdown."

      "How I found the best October Prime Day deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I ran each deal through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in three months or lowest price ever. All the products I recommend are 20% off or more and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter for NBC Select who has covered Amazon Prime Day for over five years. I\u2019ve written about the history of the sale, broken down what\u2019s included in a Prime membership and explained what to buy versus skip. I\u2019ve also appeared in Prime Day-related NBC News NOW and TODAY broadcast segments. Prior to Prime Big Deal Days, I previewed a list of deals from Amazon and sorted through them to find worthwhile sales you should know about.",

      "\u201cIt really brings me back to my childhood; that was one of the only ABBA songs that I knew growing up,\u201d says Sakolove, explaining that the other reason she loves the song is that when she was waiting for her callback on the role of Rosie, she heard it playing everywhere she went, like a good omen.",

      "It changed her perspective from focusing on how well she technically sang the song to ensuring that it connected with audience instead.",
      "\"I just feel this responsibility to look past how I'm going to sing it and not consider what I'm going to sound like on the money note, but to tell the story the best I can to open up the audience and let them have whatever experience and whatever telling of the story that they need at the moment,\" says Shirrell.",
      "Having a 'Romance' With the Audience",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like medicine,\u201d agrees Sakolove.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a party. Like, let\u2019s get up and celebrate and have some fun,\u201d says Steele. \u201cAny time I see the audience, when they\u2019re raring to go, you feel it. You feel that energy. You feel that they\u2019re coming here for a celebration because that\u2019s essentially what it is.\u201d",
      "And when the audience is up on their feet and singing along, Shirrell, Sakolove and Steele say that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re telling a wonderful story about friendship and love and joy,\u201d Steele says. \u201cSo, when you feel that from the audience, we appreciate it so much. We\u2019re like, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to stop.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Twenty-five years ago, \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d officially took the season of fall hostage.",
      "The light-hearted dramedy followed the lives of fast-talking, coffee-obsessed and quirky mother-daughter duo Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), who lived in the cozy and close-knit town of Stars Hollow.",
      "Created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d premiered on Oct. 5, 2000. The show aired for seven seasons from 2000 to 2007, first on The WB before it switched to The CW. Nine years after the series ended, the stars of the show reprised their roles for the Netflix four-part miniseries \u201cGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\u201d",
      "Over two decades later, the show has become a pop culture phenomenon, with fans rewatching the hit show year after year, especially when days get shorter and temperatures drop.",
      "In recent months, the nostalgia has hit a high after Graham and Bledel reunited at the 2025 Emmys. Earlier this month, a handful of actors were by Graham's side when she got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Scott Patterson, known as Luke Danes, spoke with TODAY.com about supporting his former on-screen love interest, why he's rewatching every episode again on his iHeartRadio \u201cI Am All In...Again! with Scott Patterson\" podcast, and where he envisions Luke, Lorelai and Rory would be up to in a reunion special.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "It's so awesome to celebrate the 25th anniversary of 'Gilmore Girls.' How was it reuniting with Lauren Graham and other cast members at her Walk of Fame ceremony?",
      "It was such a fun day. What a great occasion. Much deserved for Lauren, great to be there by her side and supporting her. She's a star of that show and just did a remarkable job with that character. (I) always, always support her whenever I can.",
      "This year is a milestone year for the show. Have you been reconnecting more with former castmates or have you always stayed in touch?",
      "I keep in touch with as many people as possible. I do a lot of conventions so I\u2019m always seeing Sean (Gunn) or some other cast members that do conventions. Not everybody does them.  I keep pretty plugged in.",
      "It\u2019s not like we\u2019re on a \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d cast group chat. But if we do a new project, we\u2019ll get some text messages, \u201cHey, saw the new thing. Great. Let\u2019s get together.\u201d Those kinds of things. So it\u2019s always nice and Lauren\u2019s gathering was a chance to reconnect with some people.",
      "Tell me about rewatching 'Gilmore Girls' for a second time on your podcast, 'I Am All In... Again!', and how you are feeling about it?",
      "We\u2019re on the second go-around. We just finished recapping Season 3, Episode 1, and it\u2019s where Christopher (David Sutcliffe) and Sherry (M\u00e4dchen Amick) are pregnant. Lorelei and Christopher will not be getting together. Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann) do not know and when they find out, they ridicule Lorelai and she limps into the diner trying to heal our rift because we weren\u2019t talking. We had a big blowout.",
      "I love this scene where she comes in and says, \u201cDon\u2019t see me as Lorelai. If you don\u2019t want to talk to me, I\u2019m Nancy or Minnie or whoever... I just need to talk.\u201d So she sat down, talked and got emotional.",
      "The beauty of that scene, for me, is how vulnerable she is and how clever she is to come in and say she needs to talk to me so much, she needs her friend so much that she's willing to do it under a pseudonym, which is really funny. Then just watching Luke kind of melt. His heart is reopening again.",
      "I love the writing on this show. It\u2019s so special that we got to do that every day. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s the cherry on top of the cake of all of our careers. We\u2019ll never outdo this show. There will never be another \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and these characters are going to live forever. So (I\u2019m) very lucky in that regard, I feel very, very grateful to be a part of this 25-year phenomenon. And let\u2019s raise our glasses to 25 more years.",
      "What is something new that you are doing this time around?",
      "There\u2019s a new segment I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s called \u201cThis Is Not Old Man Music.\u201d We\u2019re doing the music of the show.  I just interviewed Sister Sledge, which was an amazing interview. But we\u2019re going to be talking about the music of the show, the musicians and stars.",
      "We're just going to do what the fans do. We're going to keep re-watching, sharing new insights, new opinions. We're just having a blast doing it.",
      "Would you be up for another 'Gilmore Girls' reunion?",
      "Oh, yeah, I think they could twist my arm (laughs).",
      "What would you picture Luke doing?",
      "Same. I think that\u2019s the beauty of the characters, is they don\u2019t change. I think that\u2019s what fans want and that\u2019s really how it should be. I don\u2019t think Luke has changed, he\u2019s just gotten a little older. I don\u2019t think Lorelai\u2019s changed.",
      "I don\u2019t think, especially in Luke and Lorelai\u2019s case, that you want to change them too much. You really don\u2019t. I think that\u2019s why people love them. They\u2019re their own people. They have their own strength. They don\u2019t need each other, but they want each other and they\u2019re willing to span that bridge to get to one another and do all that it takes.",
      "But she's maybe a grandma, according to the ending of 'A Year in the Life.'",
      "Well, she is \u2014 and (maybe) she's been one for eight years, yeah. And maybe (she's) a mother, who knows? I don't know. I don't want to start rumors.",
      "Rory's boyfriends have been a big part of the show. Jared Padalecki and Matt Czuchry did a Panera commercial together, Lauren called out Milo Ventimiglia and Jared for not being at her Walk of Fame and said, 'Points for Logan.' What team are you now?",
      "I'm team none of them. I like them all as people. But as characters, I think Rory, once she gets her act together, and she probably has by now, she's been a mother for eight years, I think there's going to be a new energy coming into her life and a new person \u2014 and maybe she's already found someone!",
      "So if there is a new iteration or Christmas special, maybe we meet this person. They've been together for, you know, seven years or eight years. Or maybe she's been a single mother and she meets somebody. Maybe it's a guy who just opened a diner somewhere (laughs). I'll leave the creative writing to the creative writing team.",
      "I know there's a documentary coming out, are you involved?",
      "Yeah, (I have) nothing to do with it. They never came to me and made a deal."

      "In the Netflix series, Hunnam speaks in a voice that some viewers have described as sounding like Winnie the Pooh. What motivated the actor's approach and how did Gein sound in real life? We're breaking it all down.",
      "How Did Charlie Hunnam Invent the Ed Gein Voice in 'Monster'?",
      "\u201cMonster: The Ed Gein Story,\u201d which premiered on Oct. 3, finds Hunnam using a soft voice and often speaking slowly.",
      "In an interview with Variety, the actor described his approach, saying, \"The voice needed to be really specific.\u201d",
      "Hunnam admitted that no one working on the TV series \"really had an idea of what that was\" at first, especially since audio recordings of Gein are few and far between.",
      "Hunnam said the voice ultimately came from Gein's relationship with his mother, Augusta Gein. \u201cI started to see him through a series of affectations to please his mother. That\u2019s where the voice came from,\" he told Variety.",
      "In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Hunnam elaborated on his inspiration, saying he wanted to portray Gein's \"soul and spirit and trauma and struggle in the way he communicates with the world.\"",
      "\"There's just this constant desire for acceptance and I thought that a lot of his behavior would grow inauthentically out of his desire to be the person that he thought his mother wanted him to be and that was as much like a girl as possible,\" the actor said.",
      "Hunnam admitted that it took \"courage\" to take this approach \"because I felt like this voice is going to feel inauthentic and it's not going to feel like it belongs in his body.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein's Voice Really Sound Like?",
      "In his book \u201cDeviant,\u201d Schechter described Gein\u2019s voice, writing that a hospital social worker said Gein talked \"freely in a low voice, frequently with his head in his hands.\"",
      "The author also noted \"the softness of his voice\" and \"the meekness of his posture.\"",
      "While describing a press interview Gein gave in a courthouse, the author said he used \"a voice so quiet that the reporters in the back of the room had trouble hearing him.\"",
      "As for how to hear Gein's voice for yourself? In 2023, the documentary series \u201cPsycho: The Lost Tapes of Ed Gein\u201d also featured recordings of Gein\u2019s voice. The documentary is available to stream on MGM+.",
      "How Have Viewers Responded?",
      "After watching \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\u201d many viewers have expressed confusion over Hunnam's voice and wondered if Gein really spoke like that.",
      "One YouTube user left the following comment on a video that played a recording of Gein's real voice: \"Had to come check out the real voice because I knew damn well there was no way he sounded like Winnie the Pooh.\"",
      "\"How many other people came here after the new series of monsters came out, to see if the voice matched,\" another wrote.",
      "Another left the following reaction: \"He sounds so simple and innocuous. It's no wonder no one suspected what he was really capable of.\"",
      "One viewer said Hunnam's voice in the show \"is so different\" since Gein's real voice \"is much deeper.\"",
      "Over on X, many social media users also weighed in on the voice, with one commenting, \"I don\u2019t know if I can get through 8 hours of Charlie Hunnam and his Ed Gein voice.\"",
      "Some viewers applauded the actor for the added element of creepiness his voice lent to the role.",
      "\"Charlie hunnam\u2019s voice for ed gein sounds like winnie the pooh but i actually dont hate it at all, it honestly makes his performance more unsettling,\" one wrote.",
      "Some viewers have started to imitate Hunnam's voice in TikTok videos. One such video was captioned, \"ed gein is our whole personality now.\"",
      "Many X users agreed, including one who commented, \"Can\u2019t stop doing the Ed Gein voice from Monster.\""

    "story": [
      "It's no surprise that Melissa Joan Heart, who portrayed the title character in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" for seven seasons, loves Halloween. But she really loves Halloween \u2014 and as a former teenage witch, this mom of three knows how to make holidays magical.",
      "\"I've gotten in trouble once before because I take the day off,\" Hart tells TODAY.com. \"I'm like, 'I am not working on Halloween.' As long as my kids want to trick-or-treat, I am going.\"",
      "The busy mom, who is married to musician Mark Wilkerson, is raising their three sons: Mason, 19, Braydon, 16, and Tucker, 12. When Mason announced that he was going trick-or-treating last year, Hart dropped everything to join him.",
      "\"I really get into the costumes,\" Hart says. \"I was somehow able to magically manipulate their costumes every year for many years into a family costume.\"",
      "Some of her favorites were the years they went as Pinocchio, Megamind and the Three Amigos.",
      "\"We watched the (\"Three Amigos\") movie in May. They were all really into that movie and mimicked it all the time, so I was able to hold on to it until October,\" Hart says. But it wasn't an easy costume to create. \"I burned my fingers hot gluing rickrack onto sombreros!\"",
      "In Hart's house, Halloween candy often takes a backseat to their favorite treat: popcorn. She recently scored a year's worth of the salty snack as the \"Chief of Butter\" for Pop Secret\u2019s \u201cSpill Everything\u201d campaign. It encourages people to share their popcorn-worthy confessions \u2014 and hear Hart\u2019s \u2014 via the Pop Secret Hotline.",
      "In not-so-secret news, Hart boasts, \"A few years ago, I had the greatest parenting moment. I was able to introduce my son to his hero, Jay Weinberg.\"",
      "Weinberg was the drummer for the metal band Slipknot. Partly because Hart married a musician, music is a huge way she and her husband bond with the kids. So when Hart's oldest son Mason wanted to be Weinberg for Halloween, she was all-in.",
      "\"It was a process of finding the right wig, the tattoo, the uniform, sewing patches on the uniform and then getting the mask,\" she explains. \"My friend Kelly Osborne helped me get the mask.\"",
      "Yes, she means the Kelly Osborne, daughter of Sharon and Ozzy Osborne. Kelly's fianc\u00e9 is Sid Wilson, another member of Slipknot.",
      "After receiving a genuine Slipknot mask in a care package from the Osborne family, Hart posted an images of Mason's costume on social media and tagged both Osborne and Weinberg. As luck would have it, Weinberg commented, leading to a DM conversation \u2014 and since he lives near Hart in Nashville, she invited him over for dinner to surprise Mason.",
      "It's one thing to shock your Spider-Man-loving toddler with a \"real\" Spider-Man, but introducing your 17-year-old son to his favorite musician is quite another.",
      "\"I got to be a hero for a day!\" she says."

      "The report said that \u201cit seems probable that this activity was the result of his desire to re-create the existence of his own mother.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the death of his mother, he felt that he had a special power whereby he could raise the dead to life by an act of his will power; and when he found that this was not successful, his emotional needs influenced him to attempt the re-creation of his mother by using the parts of bodies from other graves,\u201d the report said.",
      "Ed Gein also lambasted the moral standards of the two women he killed. His comments had a \"strong religious connotation,\" per a social service report from in 1957, and he had learned \"religious training from his mother.\""

      "Annie went on to explain her response, saying, \"I'll support my kids, but (would be) making sure that they're informed. Like, 'Do you know what you're doing? Do you know what you're getting into? Do you know what you're signing up for?\" she said.",
      "Nick then asked Annie if she thinks certain subsets of the LGBTQ+ community are \"a fad.\"",
      "\"100%,\" she said.",
      "Nick then explained why he would be concerned if his child's friend suggested they might be a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"When kids start having those thoughts too young \u2014 and maybe I am old fashioned \u2014 but it's like a concern for me because who's telling you that?\" he said.",
      "Nick went on to recall a time in high school where he was \"depressed.\" Concerned about his well-being, his mother was curious if something bigger was going on and asked if her son was gay. He said no.",
      "The conversation elicited a strong response from viewers.",
      "\"Nick and Annie\u2019s conversation about potential children identifying as LGBTQIA is sickening beyond belief and a tragic reminder of what our youth are facing. People deserve more than this,\" one X user commented.",
      "Another penned the following reaction: \"Watching love is blind and genuinely shocked that netflix included the conversation between Annie and Nick talking about if they would be okay having lgbtq+ kids.\"",
      "One social media user also commented, \"I\u2019ll be fast forwarding through all of Annie and Nick scenes after that gross homophobic conversation.\"",
      "What Did Nick Say About the Backlash?",
      "Nick took to Instagram to share a response to viewer backlash. In a video message, Nick said the \"gay kids and gay love conversation\" had been \"deeply impacting me over the last couple of days.\"",
      "\u201cI appreciate you giving me all the hell that you did and saying, \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019 Yes, it was cut up and edited, but I need to take accountability too,\u201d he said.",
      "Nick admitted \"there's a lot that I didn't understand.\"",
      "The Season 9 star also clarified the use of the term \"fad\" in his conversation with Annie, saying they were referring to \"over-introducing sexual content material to kids' shows at a young age or the idea of gay identity.\"",
      "Nick said he would \"love my kids regardless\" of their sexual identity and brought up the example of his mother questioning him if he was gay in high school.",
      "\"I laughed it off and you know, I said, 'Oh no, there's no way!' But why would I have had to defend myself for that? You know, it doesn't make any sense because being gay is perfectly normal but I wasn't normalized to that,\" he said.",
      "Nick ended his video by saying he wanted to use his platform to inform others and not spread hate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much hate in this world. If I can\u2019t use this platform to help introduce people who used to think like I did to some of these new ideas ... if I can\u2019t use that platform for good then it\u2019s a platform wasted.\u201d",
      "In the caption, he wrote, \"I take full accountability for how my words came across but I am glad it provoked this discussion and my learning. I was born in a traditional Midwestern environment, and I now recognize how that shaped certain blind spots (I\u2019m thankful for the support of my friends recently for helping me learn this).\""

You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you.\"",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",

      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",

      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",

      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to enumerate the peace deals he says he forged \u2014 seven at last count.",
      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council staff in Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",
      "The prize is awarded each year by five appointees of Norway\u2019s parliament. During Trump\u2019s first term, one member of parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, was at the hairdresser waiting for his wife when his cellphone rang.",
      "Trump was calling.",
      "With the hair dryers whirring, Tybring-Gjedde said he had trouble hearing. The president thanked him for nominating him for the prize, Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview.",
      "Earlier this summer, Trump called another Norwegian, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and during the conversation also brought up the prize.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure he [Trump] really understands how this is done,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said. \u201cThe Norwegian government has nothing to do with the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "A phone call may not sway anyone, but the Nobel judges would be hard-pressed to defy a president who brokered a Middle East peace deal at long last, Trump\u2019s supporters say.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting if he does pull it off how the Nobel committee manages to ignore the fact that he did it,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican ally of the president, told NBC News."

      "Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who is well known for inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration, accepted the invitation from Amichai Chikli, Israel\u2019s minister for the diaspora and combating antisemitism.",
      "Chikli called Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 a \u201ccourageous leader on the front line against radical Islam.\u201d",

      "Robinson\u2019s invitation to Israel \u201cundermines those genuinely working to tackle Islamist extremism and foster community cohesion,\u201d the two groups added. \u201cMinister Chikli has proven himself to be a Diaspora Minister in name only.\u201d",

      "Neither Israel\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office nor the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Robinson said he had accepted the invitation and that he would travel to Israel \u201cimmediately following my October 13th trial.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old recently served an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",

      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway\u2019s worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011 and has frequently made Nazi salutes when attending court.",

      "By agreeing to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to an independent body of technocrats, Hamas appears to have agreed to one of the key points of Trump\u2019s plan to relinquish control, but it is still not clear whether it will agree to \u201cnot have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form,\u201d as the plan stipulates.",
      "The Hamas response does not address one critical point: disarmament. Trump\u2019s plan states that Hamas must agree to \u201ca process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning.\u201d This is likely to be one of the major sticking points if negotiations proceed.",
      "Hamas\u2019s response comes as the Israeli military is pressing ahead with a ground operation in famine-stricken Gaza City, despite mounting international pressure and isolation over its assault on the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the Hamas response, according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric.",
      "Guterres \u201curges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement.",
      "Qatar and Egypt, both countries involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, also welcomed the Hamas response.",
      "In his video address on Truth Social on Friday, Trump thanked Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan as countries \u201cthat helped me put this together.\u201d",
      "If the deal is consummated, it would represent the clearest foreign policy victory of Trump\u2019s second term so far \u2014 the brokering of a peace agreement that proved elusive for his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and one that he promised he would deliver quickly as he campaigned for the Oval Office in 2024.",
      "During that race, Trump highlighted a deep rift in the Democratic Party over the war that pitted pro-Israel moderates against liberal defenders of Palestinians. Though Trump\u2019s focus on helping negotiate a permanent ceasefire has waxed and waned over the course of his eight-plus months in office, the conflict was never off his radar.",
      "He assigned one of his closest allies, fellow real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, to quarterback the American deal-making team, and he put his own capital on the line in discussions with major players in the region as recently as this week.",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the president has held a vision for the Middle East that includes progress for Israel and Arab nations since he first took office in 2017 and that his insistence on wrangling an apology from Netanyahu for Israeli strikes in Qatar demonstrated his commitment to that view.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is, first of all, a very subtle, complex set of relationships being nurtured by the president with a continued emphasis on a better future,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "If a peace agreement \u201cactually happens,\u201d Gingrich added, it could put Trump in league with President Theodore Roosevelt, who negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war in the early part of the 20th century, and that \u201cwould have a substantial impact\u201d on the perception of Trump in the U.S.",
      "A senior Arab diplomat told NBC News that the Hamas response is \u201cpositive,\u201d adding: \u201cThey had no choice but to accept.\u201d",
      "But a former Western diplomat with experience in the region told NBC News that the plan could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do. Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan was met with cautious optimism earlier in the week by leaders elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.",
      "Muslim powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey welcomed the plan in a joint statement calling Trump\u2019s efforts \u201csincere.\u201d",
      "The proposal also received support from Europe, with countries that had recently defied Washington by formally recognizing Palestinian statehood welcoming the initiative.",
      "But hours after Trump announced the plan, Netanyahu reiterated his past vows to oppose Palestinian statehood.",
      "\u201cInstead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\u201d he said in Hebrew in a video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "The developments come on the eve of the second anniversary of the fighting, which began with the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the past two years."

    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 2025, 4:55 p.m ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the state represented by Sen. Richard Blumenthal. He represents Connecticut, not Illinois."

      "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s governing party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader on Saturday, setting her up to become the U.S. ally\u2019s first female prime minister.",
      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
