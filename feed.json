      "A judge has denied singer R. Kelly\u2019s request for furlough from prison after the convicted sex offender accused federal prison officials of plotting to murder him",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",
      "Pacold noted that Kelly offers no evidence to back up his claims. Government lawyers suggested Kelly had spun a \u201cfanciful conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

    "story": [
      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "The group launched in 2013 with the hip-hop heavy single album \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool,\" releasing three full-length projects before really gaining momentum with their 2016 album \u201cWings.\" Their global breakthrough came in 2017 when \u201cDNA\u201d entered the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first Korean boy band to achieve such a feat. The song\u2019s success was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, further fueling their international fan base.",
      "The band is largely credited with bringing K-pop to the international stage, and with good reason. Across their discography, BTS broke boundaries and records: In 2020, they released the five-time platinum \u201cDynamite,\u201d their first all-English single, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 a first for an all-South Korean musical act. At the height of their popularity, BTS was not only the biggest K-pop group on the planet, but the biggest boy band overall.",
      "In fact, they've been certified platinum many times over, according to The Recording Industry Association of America. Their platinum successes include:",
      "\u2014 2018's \u201cMic Drop;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2020's \u201cMap of the Soul: 7,\" \u201cLove Yourself: Answer,\u201d and \u201cIdol;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2021's \u201cBe,\u201d and song of the summer \u201cButter;\u201d",
      "\u2014 and high-profile collaborations \u201cMy Universe\u201d with Coldplay and \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d featuring Halsey.",
      "BTS has also been nominated for five Grammy Awards. Their first, for \u201cDynamite\u201d in the best pop duo/group performance category, marked the first time a K-pop act received a Grammy nod.",
      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence. Their fan base, known the world over as ARMY, responded by matching the donation within 24 hours.",
      "Their dual impact on music and social causes culminated in 2022 when they were invited to the White House to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes with President Joe Biden.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",
      "BTS tiered their enlistments, giving ample time for its members to focus on solo projects while the group was on a break.",
      "Jin released two EPs, \u201cHappy\u201d in 2024 and \u201cEcho\u201d in May of this year. Suga dropped his debut solo album, \u201cD-Day,\u201d in 2023 under his moniker Agust D.",
      "Also in 2024, RM released his second solo album, the elastic, experimental \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person\u201d, and j-hope released an EP, \u201cHope on the Street Vol. 1.\" Earlier this year, j-hope embarked on his first solo tour.",
      "Jimin released two projects, 2023's \u201cFace\u201d and 2024's \u201cMuse.\u201d V's debut album, the smooth alt-R&B \u201cLayover,\u201d arrived in 2023, as did Jung Kook's retro-pop debut, \u201cGolden.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- After Hollywood's \u201cNapoleon\u201d exposed the legendary emperor to a new generation, over 100 relics \u2014 which shaped empires, broke hearts and spawned centuries of fascination \u2014 are on display in Paris ahead of what experts call one of the most important Napoleonic auctions ever staged.",
      "His battered military hat. A sleeve from his red velvet coat. Even the divorce papers that ended one of history\u2019s most tormented romances \u2014 with Josephine, the empress who haunted him to the end.",
      "Two centuries after his downfall, Napoleon remains both revered and controversial in France \u2014 but above all, unavoidable. Polls have shown that many admire his vision and achievements, while others condemn his wars and authoritarian rule. Nearly all agree his legacy still shapes the nation.",
      "\u201cThese are not just museum pieces. They\u2019re fragments of a life that changed history,\u201d said Louis-Xavier Joseph, Sotheby\u2019s head of European furniture, who helped assemble the trove. \u201cYou can literally hold a piece of Napoleon\u2019s world in your hand.\u201d",
      "The auction \u2014 aiming to make in excess of 7 million euros ($7.5 million) \u2014 is a biography in objects. The centerpiece is Napoleon\u2019s iconic bicorne hat, the black felt chapeau he wore in battle \u2014 with wings parallel to his shoulders \u2014 so soldiers and enemies could spot him instantly through the gunpowder haze.",
      "\u201cPut a bicorne on a table, and people think of Napoleon immediately,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the laurel crown of Julius Caesar.\u201d",
      "The hat is estimated to sell for at least over half a million dollars.",
      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",
      "\u201cNapoleon was a great lover; his letters that he wrote are full of fervor, of love, of passion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt was also a man who paid attention to his image. Maybe one of the first to be so careful of his image, both public and private.\u201d",
      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",
      "The auction preview is open to the public, running through June 24, with the auction set for June 25.",
      "Not far from the Arc de Triomphe monument dedicated to the general's victories, Djamal Oussedik, 22, shrugged: \u201cEveryone grows up with Napoleon, for better or worse. Some people admire him, others blame him for everything. But to see his hat and his bed, you remember he was a real man, not just a legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "The COVID-19 variant that may be driving a recent rise in cases in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: \u201crazor blade throat\u201d COVID.",
      "That's because the variant \u2014 NB.1.8.1. or \u201cNimbus\u201d \u2014 may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.",

    "summary": "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
    "story": [
      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released.

      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",

      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",

      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes.

Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",

      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",

      "About half of U.S. adults say \u201ctoo little\u201d funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",
      "When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",
      "When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

Under the law, many leading pro-democracy activists, including Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, were prosecuted. Dozens of civil society groups disbanded.",
      "This month, authorities have stepped up their crackdown, including charging young activist Joshua Wong, who was already sentenced last year over a subversion case, under the law for the second time and targeting a mobile game app. Last week, China\u2019s national security authorities in Hong Kong and the city\u2019s police launched their first publicly known joint operation, raiding the homes of six people on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.",
      "Critics say the political changes indicate that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to keep intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 are shrinking.",
      "But Xia said the law only targeted an extremely small number of people who severely endanger national security. He also sought to allay concerns about Hong Kong's openness and international position.",
      "He insisted that normal international exchanges do not violate Hong Kong's national security law but rather are protected by it.",

      "The iconic helium-powered balloon that attracted myriads of tourists during the Paris Olympic Games is making a comeback to light up the French capital\u2019s skyline",
      "PARIS -- A year after it captivated crowds during the Paris Olympics, a centerpiece of the summer Games is making a comeback.",
      "The iconic helium-powered balloon that attracted myriads of tourists during the summer Games has shed its Olympic branding and is now just called the \u201cParis Cauldron.\u201d It is set to rise again into the air later Saturday, lifting off over the Tuileries Garden.",
      "Around 30,000 people are expected to attend the launch, which coincides with France\u2019s annual street music festival \u2014 the Fete de la Musique, the Paris police prefecture said.",
      "And it won't be a one-time event. After Saturday's flight, the balloon will lift off into the sky each summer evening from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but the spectacle remains.",
      "The 30-meter (98-foot) -tall floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron was only meant to be temporary, not engineered for multi-year outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it. The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons. Though it\u2019s a hot-air-balloon-style, the lift comes solely from helium \u2014 no flame, no burner, just gas and engineering.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Olympics. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now anchored in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cPumping out of sea water will continue and it will be lunchtime, following a series of lifting and resting procedures to satisfy the salvage team, before Bayesian is fully and finally out of the water,\u201d said David Wilson, spokesman for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation.",
      "The Bayesian sank Aug. 19 off Porticello, near Palermo, during a violent storm as Lynch was treating friends to a cruise to celebrate his acquittal two months earlier in the U.S. on fraud charges. Lynch, his daughter and five others died. Fifteen people survived, including the captain and all crew members except the chef.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "TMC Maritime said the vessel has been slowly raised from the seabed, 50 meters (165-feet) down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel.",
      "Eight steel lifting straps are being used to support the hull upright and to form part of a steel wire lifting system that began raising the vessel out of the water Saturday. As it is lifted up, sea water is pumped out of the hull.",
      "TMC Maritime said the vessel will be held upright, out of the water, for checks and preparations for its final journey.",
      "On Sunday, it is anticipated the floating crane platform will move the Bayesian to the Sicilian port of Termini Imerese, where a special steel cradle is waiting for it.",
      "The Bayesian is missing its 72-meter (236-foot) mast, which was cut off and left on the seabed for future removal. The mast had to be detached to allow the hull to be brought to a nearly upright position that would allow the craft to be raised.",
      "British investigators said in an interim report issued last month that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover.",
      "The report said the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph) at the time of the sinking and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Lynch, who sold Autonomy, a software maker he founded in 1996, to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion in 2011, had been acquitted on fraud charges in June 2024 by a federal court jury in San Francisco.",

      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- Lyrical duelists in Cyprus spit rhymes in head-to-head contests, keeping alive a tradition known as \u201ctsiattista\u201d that emerged centuries before the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Drake.",
      "Konstantinos Christou Grilias and Adamos Peratikos are among a new group of poets in this Mediterranean country who battle it out live on stage to the rhythms of the lute and fiddle. The battles are fierce, but you won't find any Kendrick-Drake style beef. Tsiattista made UNESCO\u2019s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2011.",
      "The similarities with American hip-hop diss songs and battle rap are many: two duelists using their wits and turns of phrase to boast how superior they are, giving opponents a schooling in an onslaught of lyrical beatdowns. It's complete with assertive gestures and the hands-behind-the-back patience of the poet waiting to pounce.",
      "\u201cEven if you\u2019d been a paramedic, I\u2019d send you to hospital with a heart attack,\u201d Peratikos told one adversary \u2014 a line with more snap in the Cypriot Greek dialect, whose syntax is akin to ancient Greek. Grilias dissed his opponent as a lightweight and a laughingstock.",
      "The audience of hundreds along a seaside promenade murmured in approval.",
      "Tsiattista battles which have been around since at least the end of the 19th century, are undergoing a bit of a revival, thanks to performers like Grilias and Peratikos.",
      "\u201cWe urge other kids who like it to come along to safeguard this institution,\u201d said Peratikos, 41. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t about awards, the goal is to keep tradition alive.\u201d",
      "The 44-year-old Grilias said he\u2019s never really delved into the world of Kendrick Lamar or Jay-Z.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve never listened to rappers. They told me that they battle in their own language, in their own way,\u201d Grilias said as he prepared for a tsiattista duel at the peak of a festival for the Orthodox Christian Pentecost.",
      "\u201cRappers don\u2019t know where Cyprus is,\" he added.",
      "The new group of performers, known as tsiattistaes, started to replace the older generation about 15 years ago at the premier competition in Larnaca during the annual Pentecost festival known as Kataklysmos, said ethnomusicologist Nicoletta Demetriou, who is director of the island nation\u2019s Music Archive.",
      "The new generation includes women, though few participate because of lingering social exclusion, Demetriou said.",
      "The current tsiattista format of a two-verse rhyme with a total of 15 syllables was developed in the late 18th to early 19th century, evolving from the introduction of the rhyming verse to the Greek-speaking world in the 15th and 16th centuries, Demetriou said. It draws on a tradition of poets matching wits from the times of Pericles in ancient Greece.",
      "The structure and musical accompaniment are simple, so that the rhymes are clear and understandable for both the audience and the adversary.",
      "Contests can address a range of themes, but the underlying premise is to determine who\u2019s the best at the diss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually a fight, meaning \u2019I\u2019d clobber you, kill you, bury you,\u201d Grilias said. \u201cBut I believe the public likes more a bit of humor, too.\u201d",
      "For contestants, it's about who shows up ready, can stay cool and make the fewest mistakes in front of a crowd.",
      "\u201cTruth is, you\u2019re stressed, you\u2019re under pressure,\" Grilias said, and \u201cthe person who can best handle this has the advantage.\u201d",
      "One useful strategy is guessing how to get into your opponent\u2019s way of thinking, predicting possible responses to your lines, Peratikos said.",
      "He dismissed AI technology as incapable of coming up with effective rhymes in the Cypriot Greek dialect.",
      "\u201cThere are words that we\u2019ve heard but we don\u2019t even know, so there\u2019s no way artificial intelligence does,\u201d Peratikos said.",
      "At the end of a long night of battling, Grilias and Peratikos finished fourth and fifth, respectively. A judging panel composed of men and women determined the winners. The two contestants took their places in stride.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all friends, that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d Grilias said.",

Some want to use the money to build up national defense.",

      "Such pressures, humanitarian groups say, diminish the pivotal role of the U.N. and its partners in efforts to save millions of lives \u2014 by providing tents, food and water to people fleeing unrest in places like Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, or helping stamp out smallpox decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most abrupt upheaval of humanitarian work in the U.N. in my 40 years as a humanitarian worker, by far,\u201d said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. humanitarian aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cAnd it will make the gap between exploding needs and contributions to aid work even bigger.\u201d",

      "Proponents say U.N. aid operations have helped millions around the world affected by poverty, illness, conflict, hunger and other troubles.",
      "Critics insist many operations have become bloated, replete with bureaucratic perks and a lack of accountability, and are too distant from in-the-field needs. They say postcolonial Western donations have fostered dependency and corruption, which stifles the ability of countries to develop on their own, while often U.N.-backed aid programs that should be time-specific instead linger for many years with no end in sight.",
      "In the case of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning WFP and the U.N.\u2019s refugee and migration agencies, the U.S. has represented at least 40% of their total budgets, and Trump administration cuts to roughly $60 billion in U.S. foreign assistance have hit hard. Each U.N. agency has been cutting thousands of jobs and revising aid spending.",
      "\u201cIt's too brutal what has happened,\u201d said Egeland, alluding to cuts that have jolted the global aid community. \u201cHowever, it has forced us to make priorities ... what I hope is that we will be able to shift more of our resources to the front lines of humanity and have less people sitting in offices talking about the problem.\u201d",
      "With the U.N. Security Council's divisions over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East hindering its ability to prevent or end conflict in recent years, humanitarian efforts to vaccinate children against polio or shelter and feed refugees have been a bright spot of U.N. activity. That's dimming now.",
      "Aside from the cuts and dangers faced by humanitarian workers, political conflict has at times overshadowed or impeded their work.",
      "UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees, has delivered an array of services to millions \u2014 food, education, jobs and much more \u2014 in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as well as in the West Bank and Gaza since its founding in 1948.",
      "Israel claims the agency's schools fan antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiment, which the agency denies. Israel says Hamas siphons off U.N. aid in Gaza to profit from it, while U.N. officials insist most aid gets delivered directly to the needy.",
      "\u201cUNRWA is like one of the foundations of your home. If you remove it, everything falls apart,\u201d said Issa Haj Hassan, 38, after a checkup at a small clinic at the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.",
      "UNRWA covers his diabetes and blood pressure medication, as well as his wife\u2019s heart medicine. The United States, Israel's top ally, has stopped contributing to UNRWA; it once provided a third of its funding. Earlier this year, Israel banned the aid group, which has strived to continue its work nonetheless.",
      "Ibtisam Salem, a single mother of five in her 50s who shares a small one-room apartment in Beirut with relatives who sleep on the floor, said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for UNRWA we would die of starvation. ... They helped build my home, and they give me health care. My children went to their schools.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis year, we have estimated around 343 million acutely food insecure people,\u201d said Carl Skau, WFP deputy executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a threefold increase if we compare four years ago. And this year, our funding is dropping 40%. So obviously that\u2019s an equation that doesn\u2019t come together easily.\u201d",
      "Billing itself as the world's largest humanitarian organization, WFP has announced plans to cut about a quarter of its 22,000 staff.",
      "One question is how the United Nations remains relevant as an aid provider when global cooperation is on the outs, and national self-interest and self-defense are on the upswing.",
      "The United Nations is not alone: Many of its aid partners are feeling the pinch. Groups like GAVI, which tries to ensure fair distribution of vaccines around the world, and the Global Fund, which spends billions each year to help battle HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have been hit by Trump administration cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Some private-sector, government-backed groups also are cropping up, including the divisive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been providing some food to Palestinians. But violence has erupted as crowds try to reach the distribution sites.",

      "\u201cYoga is expensive \u2026 but we also got humans in the ghetto. They need mental wellness,\u201d said Winya, who usually teaches in affluent areas, charging between $30 and $100 a month. That\u2019s an impossible cost for most, especially in a country where many survive through informal jobs.",
      "Since 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwe\u2019s economic problems.",
      "The sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges. Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.",
      "\u201cI am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me). This is where we come in and say, \u2018Guys, come and try yoga, it can help somehow,\u2019\u201d Winya said.",
      "Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.",
      "In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.",
      "Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.",
      "For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.",
      "\u201cMy head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains,\u201d he said. \u201cYoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.\u201d",
      "He said many Zimbabwean men bottle up their emotions, afraid to show weakness in a highly patriarchal society that prizes toughness.",
      "\u201cWe focus on physical fitness, forgetting the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suffer slowly, but what suffers first is the mind, and from there, it becomes a slow death.\u201d",
      "Edinah Makosa, 24, joined the class earlier this year and said it gave her hope.",
      "\u201cI used to be depressed a lot. You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cYoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time. Now I have started selling beauty products to earn a living. As for romance, well if it works, it works; if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. I no longer stress about men. I go with the flow.\u201d",
      "As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.",
      "\u201cWe need a proper environment and studio. But we are trying,\u201d Winya said.",
      "For participants like Mahwaya, the location didn\u2019t matter nearly as much as the healing.",
      "\u201cWe need to promote yoga in the communities because everyone has a mind. And fitness of the mind is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of where you live,\u201d he said.",

      "Some Iranians living abroad are trying to call their families back home, only to have a robotic voice answer",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- When Ellie, a British-Iranian living in the United Kingdom, tried to call her mother in Tehran, a robotic female voice answered instead.",
      "\u201cAlo? Alo?\u201d the voice said, then asked in English: \u201cWho is calling?\u201d A few seconds passed.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t heard you,\u201d the voice continued, its English imperfect. \u201cWho you want to speak with? I\u2019m Alyssia. Do you remember me? I think I don\u2019t know who are you.\u201d",
      "Ellie, 44, is one of nine Iranians living abroad \u2014 including in the U.K and U.S. \u2014 who said they have gotten strange, robotic voices when they attempted to call their loved ones in Iran since Israel launched airstrikes on the country a week ago.",
      "They told their stories to The Associated Press on the condition they remain anonymous or that only their first names or initials be used out of fear of endangering their families.",
      "Five experts with whom the AP shared recordings said it could be low-tech artificial intelligence, a chatbot or a pre-recorded message to which calls from abroad were diverted.",
      "It remains unclear who is behind the operation, though four of the experts believed it was likely to be the Iranian government while the fifth saw Israel as more likely.",
      "The messages are deeply eerie and disconcerting for Iranians in the diaspora struggling to contact their families as Israel's offensive targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites pounds Tehran and other cities. Iran has retaliated with hundreds of missiles and drones, and the government has imposed a widespread internet blackout it says is to protect the country.",
      "That has blocked average Iranians from getting information from the outside world, and their relatives from being able to reach them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d said Ellie, whose mother is diabetic, low on insulin and trapped on the outskirts of Tehran. She wants her mother to evacuate the city but cannot communicate that to her.",
      "A request for comment sent to the Iranian mission to the U.N. was not immediately answered.",
      "Most of the voices speak in English, though at least one spoke Farsi. If the caller tries to talk to it, the voice just continues with its message.",
      "A 30-year-old women living in New York, who heard the same message Ellie did, called it \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d",
      "\u201cCalling your mom and expecting to hear her voice and hearing an AI voice is one of the most scary things I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cI can feel it in my body.\u201d",
      "And the messages can be bizarre. One woman living in the U.K. desperately called her mom and instead got a voice offering platitudes.",
      "\u201cThank you for taking the time to listen,\u201d it said, in a recording that she shared with the AP. \u201cToday, I\u2019d like to share some thoughts with you and share a few things that might resonate in our daily lives. Life is full of unexpected surprises, and these surprises can sometimes bring joy while at other times they challenge us.\u201d",
      "Not all Iranians abroad encounter the robotic voice. Some said when they try to call family, the phone just rings and rings.",
      "Colin Crowell, a former vice president for Twitter\u2019s global policy, said it appeared that Iranian phone companies were diverting the calls to a default message system that does not allow calls to be completed.",
      "Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity expert based in the U.S., agreed and said the recordings appeared to be a government measure to thwart hackers, though there was no hard evidence.",
      "He said that in the first two days of Israel\u2019s campaign, mass voice and text messages were sent to Iranian phones urging the public to gear up for \u201cemergency conditions.\u201d They aimed to spread panic \u2014 similar to mass calls that government opponents made into Iran during the war with Iraq in the 1980s.",
      "The voice messages trying to calm people \u201cfit the pattern of the Iranian government and how in the past it handled emergency situations,\u201d said Rashidi, the director of Texas-based Miaan, a group that reports on digital rights in the Middle East.",
      "Mobile phones and landlines ultimately are overseen by Iran\u2019s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology. But the country\u2019s intelligence services have long been believed to be monitoring conversations.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard for anybody else to hack. Of course, it is possible it is Israeli. But I don\u2019t think they have an incentive to do this,\u201d said Mehdi Yahyanejad, a tech entrepreneur and internet freedom activist.",
      "Marwa Fatafta, Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, suggested it could be \u201ca form of psychological warfare by the Israelis.\u201d She said it fits a past pattern by Israel of using extensive direct messaging to Lebanese and Palestinians during campaigns in Gaza and against Hezbollah.",
      "The messages, she said, appear aimed at \u201ctormenting\u201d already anxious Iranians abroad.",
      "When contacted with requests for comment, the Israeli military declined and the prime minister's office did not respond.",
      "Ellie is one of a lucky few who found a way to reach relatives since the blackout. She knows someone who lives on the Iran-Turkey border and has two phones \u2014 one with a Turkish SIM card and one with an Iranian SIM.",
      "He calls Ellie\u2019s mother with the Iranian phone \u2014 since people inside the country are still able to call one another \u2014 and presses it to the Turkish phone, where Ellie\u2019s on the line. The two are able to speak.",
      "\u201cThe last time we spoke to her, we told her about the AI voice that is answering all her calls,\u201d said Ellie. \u201cShe was shocked. She said her phone hasn\u2019t rung at all.\u201d",
      "Elon Musk said he has activated his satellite internet provider Starlink in Iran, where a small number of people are believed to have the system, even though it is illegal. Authorities are urging the public to turn in neighbors with the devices as part of an ongoing spy hunt. Others have illegal satellite dishes, granting them access to international news.",
      "M., a woman in the U.K., has been trying to reach her mother-in-law, who is immobile and lives in Tehran's northeast, which has been pummeled by Israeli bombardment throughout the week.",
      "When she last spoke to her family in Iran, they were mulling whether she should evacuate from the city. Then the blackout was imposed, and they lost contact. Since then she has heard through a relative that the woman was in the ICU with respiratory problems.",
      "When she calls, she gets the same bizarre message as the woman in the U.K., a lengthy mantra.",
      "\u201cClose your eyes and picture yourself in a place that brings you peace and happiness,\u201d it says. \u201cMaybe you are walking through a serene forest, listening to the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. Or you\u2019re by the seashore, hearing the calming sound of waves crashing on the sand.\u201d",
      "The only feeling the message does instill in her, she said, is \u201chelplessness.\u201d",

      "Parks Canada officials say she was 70 and lived in Calgary.",
      "The slide happened Thursday afternoon north of Lake Louise on the Icefields Parkway, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of Calgary. It is also about 137 kilometers (85 miles) from the site of the Group of Seven summit held in Kananaskis, Alberta, this week.",

      "Niclas Brundell, a trail guide who lives in nearby Canmore, said he was hiking in the area with his wife Thursday when they both started seeing concerning signs of rocks tumbling and boulders the size of tires starting to fall.",

      "\u201cThen all of a sudden, I hear the start of another rockfall, and I turn around, and the whole mountainside is coming off.\u201d",
      "He said the slab seemed about 50 meters (164 feet) wide and 20 meters (60 feet) deep, and he and his wife started sprinting.",
      "When he turned around, he could see a group of between 15 and 30 people at the waterfall disappear under a cloud of dust.",

      "Brundell said when they got far enough to feel safe, he sent a satellite message to Parks Canada, while his wife ran to a nearby lodge to call for help.",
      "He said it\u2019s a popular trail because it\u2019s considered relatively easy, and on any given summer day there are 15 people or more hiking the trail.",

      "He said the damage caused overnight was \u201cunacceptable and did not represent a legitimate protest.\u201d",
      "What began as nationwide protests against changes to the social security system morphed Thursday night into people damaging the local airport and the facilities of banana giant Chiquita Brands, which fired thousands of striking workers in the province last month.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino had said at the time that the banana workers\u2019 strike was illegal and included some 5,000 workers.",

      "A court in Azerbaijan has convicted seven journalists on multiple charges and sentenced them to prison",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A court in Azerbaijan on Friday convicted a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist and six others on multiple charges, handing down prison sentences ranging from 7 1/2 to nine years in prison, RFE/RL and local media reported.",
      "The verdict against RFE/RL\u2019s Farid Mehralizada and six journalists from Abzas Media, an independent Azerbaijani investigative outlet, marks the latest escalation in the country's crackdown on media. All seven journalists have dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and international rights groups have called for their release.",
      "Mehralizada, a journalist with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani service and an economist, was sentenced to nine years in prison, RFE/RL reported. Nine-year sentences were also handed to Abzas Media's director Ulvi Hasanli, chief editor Sevinj Abbasova (Vagifqizi) and investigative journalist Hafiz Babali. Reporters Nargiz Absalamova and Elnara Gasimova were sentenced to eight years in prison, and deputy director Mahammad Kekelov \u2014 to 7 1/2 years, Abzas Media said.",
      "Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in a statement Friday condemned the sentences as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cthe outcome of a purely political trial based on fabricated charges, aimed at silencing voices that expose corruption and injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Azerbaijani authorities may imprison journalists, but they cannot imprison the truth,\" the group\u2019s editorial director Anne Bocand\u00e9 said. \u201cRSF calls for the immediate release of all Abzas Media defendants and urges international actors to intensify pressure on Baku.\u201d",
      "RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus in a statement Friday said Mehralizada was \u201cunjustifiably detained\u201d and called for his release.",
      "\u201cFarid has already lost a great deal. Unjustifiably detained for more than a year, he missed the birth of his child, and now waits for elusive justice. Denying this man his fundamental rights is unnecessarily cruel. Instead of perpetuating this sham, it\u2019s time to reunite Farid with his family,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Six Abzas Media journalists were arrested in November 2023. The authorities claimed that they had found 40,000 euros in cash in the outlet's office in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, and accused them of conspiring foreign currency into Azerbaijan.",
      "Mehralizada was arrested in May 2024 as part of the same case, even though both him and Abzas Media said that he never worked for the outlet. Later that year, authorities levied additional charges against Mehralizada and Azbas Media journalists, including illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, document forgery and others.",
      "In his closing statement to the court, which RFE/RL shared with The Associated Press, Mehralizada said that \u201cthe truth is that I have not committed any crime...Independent media is one of the greatest means of service to the state, the nation, and humanity. Unfortunately, journalism in our country today is almost equated with terrorism.\u201d",
      "Weeks before Mehralizada's arrest, in March 2024, Azerbaijani authorities targeted another news outlet, Toplum TV, with raids and arrests on similar charges. In December 2024, Azerbaijani authorities arrested six more journalists on smuggling charges, including five of those working for the independent Meydan TV news outlet.",
      "Earlier this year, authorities withdrew press credentials from Voice of America and Bloomberg and shut down the BBC's office in Azerbaijan.",
      "In a January 2025 report, Amnesty International said Azerbaijani authorities \"have systematically silenced independent media through politically motivated arrests\u201d and that those arrests, as well as shutting down independent news outlets, \u201cdemonstrate Azerbaijan\u2019s continued crackdown on the right to freedom of expression and media independence, with fabricated charges weaponized to stifle free media.\u201d",

      "Millions of Afghans have called Iran home for decades. But they have been leaving in large numbers since October 2023, when authorities announced a crackdown on foreigners who it said were in the country illegally. Neighboring Pakistan launched a similar campaign around the same time.",
      "Iran\u2019s war with Israel, which started last Friday, is also forcing them to flee as Israeli strikes target the country.",
      "Some 5,000 Afghans are returning daily through the Islam Qala crossing in western Herat province, according to the aid agency World Vision International.",
      "There were people \u201cat risk, distressed, and in great need\u201d among the 500,000 forcibly returned from Iran to Herat this year, the agency said.",
      "\u201cMany require support to find food and shelter, get hold of everyday essentials, and connect with their families before travelling to their hometowns or villages,\u201d said Mark Calder, the agency's communications and advocacy director for Afghanistan. \u201cBut they are returning to a country in which basic services are already in crisis.\u201d",
      "Swinging U.S. aid cuts and a shortfall in funding for humanitarian assistance have closed hundreds of health facilities and reduced other essential services like education.",
      "The U.N. said Thursday that the Afghanistan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received just 18% of its annual funding by June 19, disrupting the delivery of aid to millions, including women and children, returnees, refugees, displaced communities and other vulnerable and marginalized groups.",
      "Calder warned that the number needing lifesaving aid could \u201cspiral further\u201d if the international community did not look to support emergency needs and Afghans\u2019 efforts to start over in their homeland.",
      "Ahmadullah Muttaqi, head of Herat\u2019s Refugee Information and Public Affairs Committee, on Friday told The Associated Press that before June 13 between 3,500 and 4,000 Afghans without documentation were entering the province daily because of Iran\u2019s deportation drive. This figure has doubled since the outbreak of the war.",
      "Between 800 and 1,000 Afghans with passports were arriving in Herat every day before the war. This figure is now around 4,000, Muttaqi added.",

      "China routinely sends coast guard vessels, warships and warplanes around disputed East China Sea islands, and recently as far as Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory with military bases. Beijing also sends coast guard vessels in the South China Sea, which it claims virtually in its entirety, clashing frequently with Philippine vessels.",

It included the family's demand that Lungu's political rival and current President Hakainde Hichilema should not attend his funeral.",

      "Hichilema also apologized to the the South African government for the inconvenience.",
      "Lungu, 68, had ruled the southern African country from 2015 to 2021, when he lost power to Hichilema. He remained an influential figure in the Zambian politics ahead of elections scheduled for next year.",
      "Lungu and Hichilema were bitter rivals. Their conflict culminated in Hichilema's imprisonment in 2017, when Lungu was president. Hichilema was accused of treason after his motorcade failed to give way to Lungu\u2019s presidential convoy.",
      "Last year, Lungu accused Hichilema\u2019s government of using police to harass him and restrict his movements. His family also said the government had initially prevented him from traveling to South Africa for treatment, a charge the government denied.",

      "His optimistic account in a speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum contrasted with somber statements by some members of his government who warned at the same conference that Russia could face a recession.

      "\u201cThe perception of Russian economy as based on raw materials and dependent on hydrocarbons exports have clearly become outdated,\u201d Putin said, adding that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first four months of 2025 and inflation has dropped from double digits to 9.6%.",
      "Putin has used the annual forum to highlight Russia\u2019s economic prowess and encourage foreign investment, but Western executives have shunned it after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, leaving it to business leaders from Asia, Africa and Latin America.",
      "The economy, hit with a slew of Western sanctions, has so far outperformed predictions. High defense spending has propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation.",

      "A spokesman for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation, said the vessel has been slowly raised from the seabed, 50 meters (165-feet) down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard's ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard's legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard's ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.",
      "Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students \u2014 about a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.",
      "The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House\u2019s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government's action hours after Harvard sued.",
      "Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump's proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.",
      "\u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. \u201cOur Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.\u201d",
      "The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America's oldest and wealthiest university.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.",
      "Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they\u2019ll be able to attend the university.",
      "For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn't refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration's policies, she still hasn't heard back.",
      "\u201cYour personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,\u201d Huang said in a social media post. \u201cWhy does it have to be so hard to go to school?\u201d",
      "Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address \u201ctheir largescale improprieties\" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. \u201cThey have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\u201d Trump's post said.",
      "Trump's administration first targeted Harvard's international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard\u2019s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world\u2019s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard\u2019s reputation as a global research hub. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard\u2019s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",

      "A judge could decide Friday whether to advance OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids will go before a judge Friday, potentially setting up votes on whether to accept it for local governments, people who became addicted to the drug and other groups.",
      "This month, 49 states announced they have signed on to the the proposal. Only Oklahoma, which has a separate settlement with the company, is not involved.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane could decide as soon as Friday whether to advance the nationwide settlement, which was hammered out in negotiations between the company, groups that have sued and representatives of members of the Sackler family who own the company.",
      "If Lane moves the plan forward as it's been presented, government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal.",
      "The settlement is a way to avoid trials with claims from states alone that total more than $2 trillion in damages.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper to protect members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "In the new version, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payments would not begin until after a hearing, likely in November, during which Judge Lane would be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

    "story": [
      "Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters",
      "LONDON -- Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters.",
      "Deezer, based in Paris, is grappling with a surge in music on its platform created using artificial intelligence tools it says are being wielded to earn royalties fraudulently.",
      "The app will display an on-screen label warning about \u201cAI-generated content\" and notify listeners that some tracks on an album were created with song generators.",
      "Deezer is a small player in music streaming, which is dominated by Spotify, Amazon and Apple, but the company said AI-generated music is an \u201cindustry-wide issue.\u201d It's committed to \u201csafeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favor of training AI models,\" CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a press release.",
      "Deezer's move underscores the disruption caused by generative AI systems, which are trained on the contents of the internet including text, images and audio available online. AI companies are facing a slew of lawsuits challenging their practice of scraping the web for such training data without paying for it.",
      "According to an AI song detection tool that Deezer rolled out this year, 18% of songs uploaded to its platform each day, or about 20,000 tracks, are now completely AI generated. Just three months earlier, that number was 10%, Lanternier said in a recent interview.",
      "AI has many benefits but it also \"creates a lot of questions\" for the music industry, Lanternier told The Associated Press. Using AI to make music is fine as long as there's an artist behind it but the problem arises when anyone, or even a bot, can use it to make music, he said.",
      "Music fraudsters \u201ccreate tons of songs. They upload, they try to get on playlists or recommendations, and as a result they gather royalties,\u201d he said.",
      "Musicians can't upload music directly to Deezer or rival platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. Music labels or digital distribution platforms can do it for artists they have contracts with, while anyone else can use a \u201cself service\u201d distribution company.",
      "Fully AI-generated music still accounts for only about 0.5% of total streams on Deezer. But the company said it's \u201cevident\" that fraud is \u201cthe primary purpose\" for these songs because it suspects that as many as seven in 10 listens of an AI song are done by streaming \"farms\" or bots, instead of humans.",
      "Any AI songs used for \u201cstream manipulation\u201d will be cut off from royalty payments, Deezer said.",
      "AI has been a hot topic in the music industry, with debates swirling around its creative possibilities as well as concerns about its legality.",
      "Two of the most popular AI song generators, Suno and Udio, are being sued by record companies for copyright infringement, and face allegations they exploited recorded works of artists from Chuck Berry to Mariah Carey.",
      "Gema, a German royalty-collection group, is suing Suno in a similar case filed in Munich, accusing the service of generating songs that are \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to original versions by artists it represents, including \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville, \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d by Boney M and Lou Bega's \u201cMambo No. 5.\u201d",
      "Major record labels are reportedly negotiating with Suno and Udio for compensation, according to news reports earlier this month.",
      "To detect songs for tagging, Lanternier says Deezer uses the same generators used to create songs to analyze their output.",
      "\u201cWe identify patterns because the song creates such a complex signal. There is lots of information in the song,\u201d Lanternier said.",
      "The AI music generators seem to be unable to produce songs without subtle but recognizable patterns, which change constantly.",
      "\u201cSo you have to update your tool every day,\" Lanternier said. \"So we keep generating songs to learn, to teach our algorithm. So we\u2019re fighting AI with AI.\u201d",
      "Fraudsters can earn big money through streaming. Lanternier pointed to a criminal case last year in the U.S., which authorities said was the first ever involving artificially inflated music streaming. Prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud conspiracy, accusing him of generating hundreds of thousands of AI songs and using bots to automatically stream them billions of times, earning at least $10 million.",

      "\u201cWe will review our response as the negotiations progress,\u201d Carney said.",
      "He added: \"In parallel, we must reinforce our strength at home \u2013 and safeguard Canadian workers and businesses from the unjust U.S. tariffs. That\u2019s why today we are announcing Canada will be introducing a series of countermeasures to protect Canadian steel and aluminum workers and producers.",
      "\"First, Canada will adjust its existing counter-tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum products on July 21 to levels consistent with progress made in the broader trading agreement with the United States.\u201d",
      "Carney said Trump's trade war is running the risk of a global recession.",
      "\u201cThe world is in the middle of a trade war and several wars, actual wars, including wars that can have quite significant implications for commodity prices and global growth,\u201d said Carney, who led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina legislators have finalized a bill that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.",
      "With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law's requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law's directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.",
      "The bill's Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state's dominant electric utility.",
      "The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state\u2019s clean-energy economy. His office didn't immediately provide comment after Thursday's vote.",
      "With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "The legislation came about as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.",
      "Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.",
      "\u201cOur residents shouldn\u2019t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,\u201d Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.",
      "Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.",
      "Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.",
      "Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.",
      "\u201cThis bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they\u2019re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.",
      "Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,\u201d the company said this week.",

      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid.",
      "The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a huge hole in this concept of \u2018no tax on tips\u2019 because a lot of restaurant workers aren\u2019t receiving tips in the first place,\u201d said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.\u201d",
      "For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.",
      "The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that \u201ccash tips\u201d qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement.",
      "Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn\u2019t respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s.",
      "The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.",
      "But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal leaves out too many of those workers.",
      "The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers\u2019 bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.",
      "Skandalos tried pooling servers\u2019 tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn\u2019t understand and kept tipping.",
      "Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.",
      "Skandalos said \u201cno tax on tips\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people\u2019s pocketbooks, but now let\u2019s finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.",
      "\u201c\u2019No tax on tips\u2019 is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,\u201d he said.",
      "Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour.",
      "Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford\u2019s bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they\u2019re inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it.",
      "For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay.",
      "\u201cI think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,\u201d she said.",

      "Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s expected to be announced next week",
      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in a letter sent on Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.",
      "Most U.S. allies in NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "A NATO official on Thursday said that discussions between allies were ongoing about a new defense spending plan.",
      "\u201cFor Spain, committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive, as it would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the EU\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said in April that the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "On Thursday, S\u00e1nchez called for \u201ca more flexible formula\u201d in relation to a new spending target \u2014 one that either made it optional or left Spain out of its application.",
      "S\u00e1nchez wrote that the country is \u201cfully committed to NATO,\" but that meeting a 5% target \u201cwould be incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.\" He said that doing so would require cutting public services and scaling back other spending, including toward the green transition.",
      "Instead, Spain will need to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet the Spanish military\u2019s estimated defense needs, S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "At home, corruption scandals that have ensnared S\u00e1nchez's inner circle and family members have put the Spanish leader under increasing pressure to call an early election, even from some allies. In April, when S\u00e1nchez announced that Spain would reach NATO's previous 2% spending target, the move angered some coalition members further to the left of his Socialist Party.",
      "NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on military expenditure after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. But the alliance's plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investments of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "But Spain isn't alone among NATO's low spenders. Belgium, Canada and Italy will also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will be given to reach an agreed-upon new spending goal.",
      "A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "Global sales of personal luxury goods are projected to slide by 2% to 5% this year",
      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are \u201dslowing down but not collapsing,\u201d according to a Bain & Co. consultancy study released Thursday.",
      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",
      "\u201cStill, to be positive in a difficult moment \u2014 with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever \u2014 it\u2019s not a market in collapse,\u2019\u2019 said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D\u2019Arpizio. \u201cIt is slowing down but not collapsing.\u201d",
      "Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags.",
      "Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence.",
      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",
      "Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands \u2014 Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta \u2014 are launching new creative directors.",
      "Kering\u2019s stock surged 12% on news of the appointment. D\u2019Arpizio underlined his track record, returning French carmaker Renault to profitability and previous roles as marketing director at Volkswagen and Fiat.",
      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",
      "With aesthetic changes afoot \u201cstuffing the channels doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said.",
      "Still, many of the headwinds buffering the sector are out of companies\u2019 control.",
      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",
      "President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, \u201cplacing us well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A collision between two oil tankers just east of the world\u2019s most critical oil choke point, the Strait of Hormuz, could bring about a potential environmental disaster, Greenpeace said on Thursday.",
      "The two giant tankers, ADALYNN and Front Eagle, crashed Tuesday in the Gulf of Oman and caught fire before the Emirati national guard intervened to evacuate crew members. No injuries were reported, according to Emirati authorities.",
      "Satellite data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System showed heat signatures in the area early Tuesday morning.",
      "Greenpeace said it had reviewed satellite imagery that showed a plume of oil stretching up to about 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) from the crash site. The 23-year-old tanker ADALYNN belonged to a so-called Russian \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2013 known to operate older ships below basic security standards \u2013 and may have been carrying around 70,000 tons of crude oil, the group said.",
      "\u201cThis is just one of many dangerous incidents to take place in the past years,\u201d said Farah Al Hattab of Greenpeace\u2019s Middle East and North Africa division, adding that such oil spills \"endanger marine life.\u201d",
      "The United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear what caused Tuesday's incident. British maritime security firm Ambrey said it was unrelated to fighting between Israel and nearby Iran.",
      "The Strait of Hormuz, near where the collision took place, is the strategic maritime entryway to the Persian Gulf and sees about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil pass through it, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2024, an average of 20 million barrels of oil traveled through it daily.",
      "After Israel launched airstrikes against Iran on June 13, oil prices surged as worry mounted over whether the Islamic Republic might block the waterway.",
      "Maritime ship experts say shipowners are increasingly wary of using the waterway, with some ships having tightened security and others canceling routes there. As the Israel-Iran conflict intensified over the weekend, hundreds of ships in the strait saw spotty navigation signals and had to rely more on radar.",
      "The Financial Times reported on June 13 that the world\u2019s largest publicly listed oil tanker company, Frontline \u2013 which owns the Front Eagle oil tanker involved in Tuesday\u2019s crash \u2013 said it would turn down new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is set to keep interest rates on hold Thursday as fears grow that the conflict between Israel and Iran will escalate to involve the United States and send oil prices soaring and push U.K. inflation further above target.",
      "The bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its main interest rate at the two-year low of 4.25% as they await to see how the conflict in the Middle East pans out over coming days.",
      "With U.K. inflation at 3.4% above the bank's target rate of 2%, policymakers are likely to be mindful of the impact on oil prices, which have risen sharply in recent days to over $75 a barrel.",
      "The prevailing view at the bank was that inflation would remain elevated over the coming months but start to head back towards next year. The uptick in oil prices has the potential to scupper that expectation.",
      "\u201cThe risk to energy prices has clearly intensified and moved up the agenda given developments in the Middle East,\u201d said Sandra Horsfield, an economist for Investec.",
      "Uncertainty over the level of tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump will impose around the world is also clouding the outlook for prices around the world. Though the U.K. looks like it will be spared a raft of tariffs, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.",
      "That tariff concern is at the forefront of concerns at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday kept its key rate unchanged, to the chagrin of Trump, who has been urging the central bank to join others, such as the Bank of England and European Central Bank, and cut borrowing costs.",
      "Since its first quarter-point rate cut last August from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England has played it steady, reducing interest rates every three months. That would mean the next reduction is in August.",

      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's central bank said Thursday it has reduced its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, adding that inflationary pressures have eased.",
      "The Swiss National Bank says its policy rate would drop to zero from 0.25%, after noting that nearly flat inflation nosed into negative territory in May compared to February.",
      "Many Western economic powers have been grappling with monetary policy at a time when prices have fallen in many places but political instability \u2014 particularly when it comes to conflicts in the oil-rich Middle East \u2014 and U.S. tariffs have unsettled financial markets in recent months.",
      "The SNB attributed the drop in inflation in Switzerland primarily to declining prices in the tourism and oil sectors. It's now projecting annual inflation at 0.2% this year, before edging up to a half-point next year and 0.7% in 2027, based on the scenario that its target interest rate will remain at zero over that span.",
      "\u201cIn its baseline scenario, the SNB anticipates that growth in the global economy will weaken over the coming quarters,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cInflation in the U.S. is likely to rise over the coming quarters. In Europe, by contrast, a further decrease in inflationary pressure is to be expected.\u201d",
      "Switzerland enjoyed \u201cstrong\u201d economic growth in the first quarter, the bank said, largely because exports to the United States were brought forward as companies sought to anticipate future U.S. tariffs that could raise price of foreign goods for American consumers.",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve kept its key rate unchanged Wednesday as it waits for additional information on how tariffs and other potential disruptions will affect the economy this year. U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed the Fed to lower interest rates, hoping it will boost the U.S. economy.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Buss family's decision to sell a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at an eye-popping franchise valuation of $10 billion marks the end of nearly a half-century when one of the most valuable properties in the sports world was run by an eccentric father and his sometimes squabbling children.",
      "With high-living playboy Jerry Buss and current team governor Jeanie Buss in charge, the glamorous Lakers essentially have been the professional sports equivalent of a quirky family business for two generations.",
      "Sports became increasingly corporate and monolithic in the 21st century while franchise values skyrocketed and ever-more-wealthy titans seized control of this perpetual growth industry.",
      "Just not around Hollywood's favorite basketball team, with its gold uniforms and 17 golden trophies.",
      "\u201cThe majority of businesses in this country are family-owned businesses,\u201d Jeanie Buss told NPR earlier this year in a rare interview to promote a Netflix comedy series based on her career. \u201cAnd everybody has a family. If you\u2019re in business with them, (disagreements) happen. But at the end of the day, what brings you together is the team or the business, and you want to build something successful.\u201d",
      "The Lakers and the Buss clan have been inextricable since 1979 \u2014 the longest active ownership tenure in the NBA \u2014 but Mark Walter's stunning sports coup Wednesday effectively ends this improbable era. A person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed it to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced the deal.",
      "The sale should make an extraordinarily wealthy woman of Jeanie Buss, one of Jerry\u2019s seven acknowledged children and a longtime employee of his various sporting concerns.",
      "And that's the biggest reason many Lakers fans are rejoicing: This lavish sale comes with the knowledge that the buyers have exponentially more resources than the Buss family \u2014 and Walter has showed he knows how to spend it intelligently.",
      "Walter, who heads a group that already bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021, has a sterling reputation in Southern California for his group's stewardship of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The iconic baseball team has become a perpetual World Series contender with bold, aggressive financial moves grounded in smart organizational planning ever since Walter's firm, Guggenheim Partners, paid $2 billion to wrest the Dodgers from the reviled Frank McCourt in 2012.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really committed to the city of Los Angeles in various ways, and sports is something that he\u2019s very passionate about, and certainly Los Angeles sports,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Speaking (as) a Dodger employee, he\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family.\u201d",
      "In the Buss era, the Lakers could sell prospective players on their trophies, sunny Los Angeles and that family-business intimacy. While that was enough to win big in most decades, Walter\u2019s group epitomizes the modern, deep-pocketed approach to building a consistent championship contender. Guggenheim Partners reportedly has $325 billion under management, with Walter particularly leveraging insurance investments to pursue gains across the breadth of the sports world.",
      "\u201cHe does everything he can to provide resources, support,\" Roberts said. \u201cHe wants to win. He feels that the fans, the city, deserve that. I think that that\u2019s never lost, and it\u2019s more of challenging us always. How do we become better and not complacent or stagnant, to continue to stay current with the market, the competition to win?\u201d",
      "Before this sale, the Buss siblings were not thought to be particularly wealthy, at least not by team owner standards. Jeanie Buss occasionally appeared to balk at writing certain checks \u2014 ask any Lakers fan about Alex Caruso's departure \u2014 and the team's front office and infrastructure are thought to be on the NBA's smaller side.",
      "The new ownership group's wealth could knock down some financial barriers in the restrictive, apron era of salary cap management. It definitely will provide the Lakers with every resource in scouting, player development and any other competitive avenue to assemble a team commensurate with the Lakers' brand.",
      "\u201cI know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss,\u201d Magic Johnson wrote on social media. \u201cNow she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She\u2019s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans!\u201d",
      "There is a familial symmetry to these two transactions 46 years apart: Jerry Buss got a steal when he bought the Lakers, and his kids might end up with the wealthiest deal in sports history when they sell.",
      "Jerry Buss was a chemist and USC instructor who heavily leveraged his real estate investments to buy the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum arena and a large ranch from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million. Buss loved a good time almost as much as he loved basketball, and he built the Showtime era of Lakers basketball on Magic and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but also on his own undeniable charisma and hunger for titles.",
      "Buss and his front offices then landed Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the 1990s, ushering in a second championship era. All told, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals in 16 of Jerry Buss' 34 seasons as their primary owner, winning a whopping 10 championships.",
      "Jeanie Buss succeeded her father as the Lakers\u2019 governor upon his death in 2013. Her brother, Jim, was the Lakers' head of basketball operations until Jeanie fired him in February 2017 and installed Johnson and Rob Pelinka, Bryant's former agent. Pelinka gradually took over basketball operations and presided over a string of Lakers-worthy player additions, including LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic.",
      "The Lakers won the 2020 championship in the Florida bubble, and they reached the 2024 Western Conference finals. Their seismic trade to acquire Doncic last winter rejuvenated the franchise, positioning the Slovenian superstar as the Lakers' centerpiece for years after the matchless career of James, who has essentially confirmed he will return in the fall for his record 23rd NBA season.",
      "Jeanie Buss hasn't yet announced her reasons for agreeing to sell her inheritance, and she will remain the Lakers' governor \u2014 at least for now, because a governor must own at least 15% of the team. But she is following a recent trend of high-profile NBA owners ceding their teams to ownership groups with even more extensive resources.",
      "Buss is close friends with both Mark Cuban, who sold his majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion, and Wyc Grousbeck, who sold the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion.",

      "Long Island\u2019s last commercial duck farm is rebuilding after a bird flu outbreak forced the destruction of its entire 100,000-bird flock in January",
      "AQUEBOGUE, N.Y. -- Doug Corwin knew there was a problem at his family\u2019s commercial duck farm in Long Island when he spotted scores of dead or lethargic birds during a barn inspection in January.",
      "Within days, Crescent Duck Farm became a casualty of the global avian flu outbreak, one of many farms around the U.S. that had to cull their entire flock, sending the prices of eggs and other agricultural commodities soaring.",
      "Now the more than century-old farm \u2014 the last duck farm remaining in a New York region once synonymous with the culinary delicacy \u2014 is cautiously rebuilding.",
      "But for Corwin, a 66-year-old fourth-generation farmer, it's not enough to bring the farm back to its 100,000-bird capacity.",
      "With ducks hatched from eggs spared from slaughter, he's working to preserve the unique lineage of fowl that's allowed his family's farm to thrive even as others on Long Island fell by the wayside \u2014 all while worrying that another flu outbreak would finally wipe him out.",
      "\u201cAll I know is I don\u2019t want to be hit again,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cIf I go through this twice, I\u2019m done as a duck farmer.\u201d",
      "For months, Corwin and his reduced staff have been thoroughly sanitizing the farm\u2019s dozens of barns, clearing out hay and debris, and replacing feeders, ventilation systems, wooden and metal structures and more.",
      "At the end of May, the first wave of roughly 900 young ducks arrived from a nearby farm where they had been carefully raised in quarantine these last few months.",
      "Another batch of 900 arrived last week and some 900 more will soon make their way to the roughly 140-acre (55-hectare) farm in Aquebogue, which is tucked among the vineyards and agricultural lands of Long Island\u2019s North Fork, about 80 miles (129 km) east of Manhattan.",
      "By the end of next summer, Corwin hopes the first ducks will be ready to be processed and brought to market.",
      "But he says he won't rush the reopening. It will be many more months \u2014 if ever \u2014 before the operation, which processed about 1 million ducks for consumption annually, returns to full capacity, he said.",
      "\u201cI keep telling people I\u2019m running a high hurdle race,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot a lot of steps to get back to where we were.\u201d",
      "Since 2022, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in all 50 states, leading to more than 1,700 recorded outbreaks affecting nearly 175 million birds, according to the most recent tally from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The outbreak at Corwin\u2019s farm shows how this strain has inflicted more damage on a wider range of species than past variants, said Dr. Gavin Hitchener, director of Cornell University\u2019s Duck Research Laboratory, located a short drive away in Eastport.",
      "Ducks have generally been less prone to serious illness and death than chickens and turkeys, he said. H5N1 is also vexing American cattle farmers after the virus jumped from fowl to cattle last year.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed in the virus\u2019 makeup that has made it more virulent,\u201d Hitchener said.",
      "With no end to the bird flu pandemic in sight, Corwin worries he won't be able to weather another outbreak.",
      "The farm received federal compensation for its euthanized ducks, but it wasn\u2019t nearly close to the market value of the birds \u2014 never mind the expense of rebuilding in a high cost region that also includes the Hamptons, he said.",
      "Corwin hopes the federal government will, at long last, require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu. It\u2019s an uphill climb, given the Trump administration\u2019s deep skepticism of vaccines and the long-standing opposition of far larger, industrial poultry operations, he acknowledged.",
      "\u201cI would sleep an awful lot better at night. But right now I\u2019m very nervous,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just playing with deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d",
      "The ducks newly arrived to the farm are crucial to its revival.",
      "Fully grown and approaching breeding age, the cohort of white Pekin ducks were all that survived from the more than 15,000 eggs state officials allowed the farm to spare from the winter culling after they tested negative for bird flu.",
      "That means they and their progeny carry on the unique genetic makeup the farm has honed over generations of selective breeding to build its reputation.",
      "Established in 1908 by Corwin\u2019s great-grandfather, Crescent Duck Farms has been the island\u2019s lone commercial duck operation for the better part of a decade. But in the early 1960s, Long Island boasted more than 100 farms producing about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s duck output.",
      "\u201cI feel I owe it to the ancestors of farmers who\u2019ve been here all these years and have come this far to just make a go of it,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI want to make Long Island proud.\u201d",

      "Redemption Holding Co. has completed its acquisition of Utah-based Holladay Bank & Trust, making it the first time a bank has been owned by a Black-led investment group in the Western U.S.",
      "The newly formed Redemption Bank will be the first Black-owned bank in U.S. history not physically located within an economically vulnerable community, the first in the Rockies, and the only one located in the Black-banking desert that stretches from Houston to Los Angeles.",
      "The bank, with roughly $65 million in assets, will focus primarily on doing commercial lending and creating a dedicated team for small business loans.",
      "Ashley Bell, CEO and chairman of Redemption Holding, told The Associated Press the company will launch a fully digital platform at the end of summer, enabling it to service small businesses across the country. The company will remain headquartered in Salt Lake City, a city with a Black population of under 3%.",

We are committed to competing in Utah to earn the business of customers from all backgrounds,\" Bell said.",
      "The original purchase of Holladay Bank was announced in 2023, but Bell said the transaction got delayed due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank that year.",
      "\u201cThis process has undoubtedly taken longer than any of us anticipated,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHowever, we are grateful for the diligence of the staff at the FDIC, the leadership of the (American Bankers Association), and the renewed sense of urgency from the new administration this year, all of which helped bring everything together.\u201d",
      "Bernice A. King, the youngest child of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is expected to serve as Redemption Bank\u2019s senior vice president for corporate strategy and serve on the company\u2019s advisory board.",
      "The company will be the 24th Black-owned bank in the nation, which are known as Minority Depository Institutions (MDI). The last created MDI, a federal designation for banks and unions that are owned or directed by minority groups, was Adelphi Bank in 2023.",
      "MDIs began in the 19th century when Black Americans, who could not get loans from mainstream banks, organized their banks and associations. They also provided financial services and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods.",
      "The Civil Rights Movement spurred the creation of more MDIs as Black people experienced a financial boom and began to build stronger communities. In the late 1980s, Congress officially created MDIs through the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).",

      "The Buss family has agreed to sell the controlling stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to TWG Global CEO Mark Walter, doing so with a franchise valuation of $10 billion \u2014 the highest ever for a professional sports franchise, a person with knowledge of the agreement said Wednesday.",
      "As part of the deal, Jeanie Buss \u2014 whose family has had control of the Lakers since her father bought the team in 1979 \u2014 intends to remain as team governor, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced details.",
      "It is not clear how much more of the Lakers that Walter is acquiring. He was part of a group that bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021. Jeanie Buss will still own at least 15% of the Lakers once this transaction is completed; by NBA rule, a governor must have at least that much of an ownership stake.",
      "Walter and TWG Global already had the controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, and \u2014 through TWG Motorsports \u2014 owns several auto racing teams including Cadillac Formula 1.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said news of the sale to Walter marks \"a very exciting day for the Lakers, for the city of Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family,\" Roberts said.",
      "ESPN first reported the agreement.",
      "\u201cMark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand,\u201d Lakers legend Magic Johnson, a business partner of Walter's and someone extremely close to Jeanie Buss, posted on social media. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding on what he\u2019s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers. Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!\u201d",
      "Johnson said he is certain Jeanie Buss made the deal only after being convinced that Walter will do right by the Lakers.",
      "\u201cLaker fans should be (ecstatic),\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA few things I can tell you about Mark \u2014 he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike \u2014 they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world.\u201d",
      "Walter is intensely private in shunning the spotlight. He is CEO of the financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, which is estimated to have more than $325 billion in assets. Johnson is among Guggenheim\u2019s investors.",
      "The agreement for the sale of the Lakers comes about three months after Bill Chisholm agreed to buy the Boston Celtics with an initial valuation of $6.1 billion \u2014 which was going to be a record, topping the previous mark of $6.05 billion sale for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The Celtics' sale is not yet finalized, pending final approval by the NBA's board of governors. That board is scheduled to meet in Las Vegas next month.",
      "And now, the Lakers are sold with a valuation of $10 billion \u2014 not just a record, but a total smashing of the previous mark.",
      "The Lakers have been in the control of the Buss family for 46 years, the longest of any current NBA franchise. Herb Simon bought the Indiana Pacers \u2014 currently in the NBA Finals \u2014 in 1983, the second-longest current ownership of an NBA club.",
      "Jerry Buss bought the Lakers for $67.5 million and made it to the NBA Finals 16 times out of his 34 seasons leading the club, winning 10 championships in that span. When he died in 2013, ownership of the Lakers went into a trust controlled by Buss\u2019 six children \u2014 who all worked for the Lakers in various capacities for several years.",
      "Eventually, the family began clashing over control. An agreement was struck in 2017 calling for Jeanie Buss to serve as controlling owner, ending a battle that included her going to court after her brothers Jim and Johnny Buss called for a board meeting that she interpreted as a challenge to her power \u2014 shortly after she removed Jim Buss as the Lakers\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations.",

      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle",
      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "The fly's appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins\u2019 plan \u201cseems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\u201cThe only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\u201d Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\u201cWe have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\u201d Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\u201d",

      "More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone",
      "NEW YORK -- More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone. Or rather, wireless services that could power it.",
      "From cosmetics to snacks and signature spirits, brands launched or co-owned by high-profile figures are just about everywhere you look today. But several big names are also venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators \u2014 or MVNOs, an industry term for businesses that provide cell coverage by leasing infrastructure from bigger, more established carriers.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's family was the most recent to join the list with the launch of Trump Mobile this week. Here's what to know.",
      "On Monday, The Trump Organization (currently run by the president's sons Eric and Donald Jr.) unveiled Trump Mobile. The company says this new business will offer cell service, through an apparent licensing deal with \u201call three major cellular carriers\" in the U.S., and sell gold phones by August.",
      "Trump Mobile marks the latest in a string of new Trump-branded offerings \u2014 which already span from golden sneakers to \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d bibles \u2014 despite mounting ethical concerns that the president is profiting off his position and could distort public policy for personal gain.",
      "\"This raises a real question about a conflict of interest,\u201d said Ben Bentzin, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business. As the sitting president, Trump appoints leadership for the Federal Communications Commission \u2014 and the family's new phone venture exists under this regulatory authority.",
      "All of this sets Trump Mobile apart from other big names that have recently ventured into the wireless business. Still, its launch arrives as a growing number of celebrities tap into this space.",
      "Just last week, actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett launched SmartLess Mobile, a name that mirrors the trio's \u201cSmartLess\u201d podcast. Now live across the contiguous U.S. and Puerto Rico, SmartLess Mobile runs on T-Mobile's 5G Network.",
      "Another wireless provider with ties to fame is Mint Mobile. While not launched by celebrities, Ryan Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in Mint in 2019. Mint's parent, the Ka\u2019ena Corporation, was later acquired by T-Mobile in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion.",
      "Beyond names of famous people, well-known brands that weren't traditionally in the phone business have also got in on the action over the years \u2014 particuarly outside of the U.S., Forrester Research senior analyst Octavio Garcia Granados notes. He points to Walmart's \u201cBait\u201d mobile plan in Mexico, for example, as well as Italian soccer club AC Milan launching its own mobile SIM cards for fans.",
      "\u201cThe MVNO market is not new,\" said Garcia Granados. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the development on how it\u2019s consumed and the (ease) for brands to launch such plans.\u201d",
      "MVNOs have also emerged outside of high-profile brands or launch teams. Bentzin points to Straight Talk and Cricket \u2014 which are now owned by Verizon and AT&T, respectively. Still, traditional celebrity endorsements are common across the board. And in recent years, \u201cinfluencer marketing\" has been \u201cthe fastest growing area of advertising and promotion,\" he notes.",
      "For Trump Mobile, the pitch seems to be all about having an \u201call-American service\" while also tapping into the fan base of the president.",
      "The company noted Monday that it chose to unveil Trump Mobile on the 10th anniversary of Trump launching \"his historic presidential campaign.\u201d The name given to its flagship offer, The 47 Plan, and the $47.45 monthly fee make reference to the president's two terms. And a mock-up of the planned gold phone on the company\u2019s website shows Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great\u201d slogan on the front screen.",
      "According to the company, Trump Mobile's 47 Plan will include unlimited calls, texts and data through partner carriers, as well as free roadside assistance and telehealth services. It also says the new phone, called the \u201cT1 Phone,\u201d will be available for $499 in August \u2014 but notes that this device won\u2019t be designed or made by Trump Mobile. Still, the company emphasized that these phones will be built in the U.S.",
      "Experts have since shared skepticism about that being possible in two months. And beyond the future T1 Phone, others stress that a monthly cell service fee of just under $50 is pricey compared to other MVNO options today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not actual lower pricing. It\u2019s really trading on the fan base, if you will, of Trump,\u201d said Bentzin.",
      "SmartLess Mobile and Mint Mobile, of course, don't carry these same political ties. And the wireless plans offered by both boast less expensive offerings.",
      "T-Mobile-owned Mint advertises \u201cflexible, buy-in-bulk\u201d plans that range from $15 to $30 a month. Each option includes unlimited talk and text nationwide, but vary depending on plan length and data amount. Mint, founded in 2016, says it started \u201cbecause we\u2019d had enough of the wireless industry\u2019s games\u201d \u2014 and promises to help consumers avoid hidden fees.",
      "SmartLess Mobile's plans also start at $15 a month. Depending on the data amount purchased, that base fee can rise to $30 \u2014 but all of its plans similarly offer unlimited talk and text using T-Mobile's network. When launching last week, SmartLess underlined that its goal is to help people stop paying for the data they don't use, noting that the majority of data used by consumers today happens over Wi-Fi.",
      "\u201cSeriously, if your phone bill knew how often you\u2019re on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed,\" Hayes said in a statement for SmartLess Mobile's June 10 launch.",
      "MVNOs have proven to be attractive acquisitions to big wireless carriers over the years. But whether or not the star factor promises significant demand has yet to be seen for the market's most recent entrants.",
      "For the more established Mint Mobile, Reynolds' investment is a success story. The 25% stake that the actor reportedly owned in 2023, when the company announced that it would be acquired by T-Mobile, was estimated to give him a personal windfall of over $300 million in cash and stock. And since that deal closed, Reynolds has remained in his creative role for Mint and as the face of many campaigns \u2014 helping the brand continue to attract new customers.",
      "It's no surprise that the potential of such business returns might attract other celebrities to make similar investments, Bentzin notes. Still, newer ventures are untested. And \"as the market becomes more crowded, it could be harder and harder to pick off individual consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond a high-profile name, quality of service and what consumers can afford is also critical.",
      "\u201cThe competition battleground here is brand and price,\u201d Bentzin said.",
      "Still, if the marketing is right and product meets consumer needs, experts like Garcia Granados note that MVNOs can be a profitable business, for both the brands that start them and the telecommunications giants \u2014 like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T \u2014 offering this \u201cwholesale\u201d access to their infrastructure.",
      "As a result, he said, such high-profile ventures become \u201ca catalyst for others to follow.\"",

      "The Hamilton-based Chiefs lost in the final for the third straight year and for the second time to the Crusaders by a margin of five points or less.",
      "The Crusaders clung to a one-point lead for 33 minutes, from just before halftime until the 71st minute when flyhalf Rivez Reihana kicked a penalty for the only points of the second half. They then held on under immense pressure to clinch their victory.",
      "The win was especially poignant for the Crusaders, who won only four matches last year in one of their worst-ever seasons, ending their run of seven-straight titles. They were also playing for the last time in the \u201ctemporary\u201d stadium that has been their home ground since their former headquarters was destroyed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.",
      "The Crusaders' kicking game was superb and they dominated the contest in the air, particularly through fullback Will Jordan. They kept Chiefs' flyhalf Damian McKenzie under wraps and their defense was superb, though the Chiefs scored first-half tries through prop George Dyer and fullback Shaun Stevenson.",
      "The Crusaders scored a try through veteran hooker Codie Taylor and led 13-12 at halftime with a conversion and two penalties to Reihana.",
      "\u201cWhere we were at the end of last year, the start of this year we had a mountain to climb,\u201d said Jordan, who won his seventh Super Rugby title. \"Everyone had to dig deep and it hasn't been easy.",
      "\u201cIt's taken some long hours, some hard conversations but we just ground it out tonight in front of our fans.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs were stifled for long periods by the Crusaders' smothering defense. While they disrupted the Crusaders' lineout, they were under pressure at scrums and they weren't able to create the space their backs needed in the second half.",
      "\u201cIt was a classic final, two great teams going at it and a small margin,\u201d Chiefs captain Luke Jacobson said. \"The Crusaders did really well to win the halfway and play at the right end of the field.",
      "\u201cI felt we had some good attack when we got into their half, we put some good pressure on them but we just didn't play enough footy down there.\u201d",
      "The Crusaders started the match applying pressure on the Chiefs inside their 22. When the Chiefs finally got possession, they had 24 phases inside the Crusaders' 22 before McKenzie knocked on.",
      "The Crusaders conceded two early scrum penalties, then the Chiefs conceded two as the set piece began untidily.",
      "Crusaders captain David Havili was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute after a head clash with Chiefs winger Emoni Narawa. From the resulting penalty, the Chiefs kicked into the corner, won the lineout and midfielder Quinn Tupaea had two strong carries before Dyer scored under the posts.",
      "Taylor broke away from a disintegrating maul in the 26th minute and dashed more than 20 meters down the narrow left flank to score. Reihana's conversion leveled the score at 7-7 and the Crusaders led for the first time in the 28th minute when a Reihana penalty. Another penalty made the score 13-7.",
      "The Chiefs hit back just before halftime with a try to Stevenson who scored in the right corner after 16 phases.",

The only wicket to fall Saturday morning was the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim, who fell agonizingly short of a half-century, run out for 49 in the last play before the interruption.",
      "Mushfiqur nudged a shot to mid-on and set off in pursuit of his half-century. But debutant Tharindu Rathnayake swooped on the ball and rifled in a bullet throw to catch the batter just short.",

      "With six wickets still in hand and a healthy cushion on the board, Bangladesh is well ahead in the game. But the looming threat wasn't spin or reverse swing, but the weather.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers have donated $1 million to assist families impacted by two weeks of immigration raids in Southern California",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have donated $1 million to assist families impacted by two weeks of immigration raids in Southern California.",
      "The defending World Series champion Dodgers also said Friday that they intend to form partnerships with the California Community Foundation, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and other organization to continue providing aid to immigrant families.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Los Angeles has reverberated among thousands upon thousands of people, and we have heard the calls for us to take a leading role on behalf of those affected,\u201d Dodgers president Stan Kasten said. \u201cWe believe that by committing resources and taking action, we will continue to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "The Dodgers announced the steps in a five-paragraph news release that was delicately worded to avoid potentially inflammatory political terms, and which stopped short of an explicit condemnation of the federal policy. The team said only that the financial aid would be provided \u201cfor families of immigrants impacted by recent events in the region.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before his team faced the Washington Nationals. \u201cI\u2019m sure the money is going to be allocated in the right way. I\u2019m happy to hear that the Dodgers have done that, and it\u2019s certainly the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "The Dodgers were briefly at the center of Southern California's opposition to federal immigration policy when the team asked federal agents to leave the stadium grounds Thursday after they amassed at a parking lot near one of the gates.",
      "Dozens of federal agents with their faces covered arrived at a lot near the stadium's Gate E entrance in SUVs and cargo vans. A group of protesters carrying signs against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived shortly afterward, and the agents eventually left.",
      "Roberts claimed his players haven\u2019t extensively discussed the situation in the clubhouse, but some Dodgers have been paying attention. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, a Puerto Rico native, sharply criticized the raids on social media last weekend. Baseball Hall of Famer Jaime Jarr\u00edn, the Dodgers\u2019 lead Spanish-language broadcaster from 1959 until his retirement in 2022, also spoke up against the federal actions.",
      "Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass praised the Dodgers in the team's news release.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the Dodgers for leading with this action to support the immigrant community of Los Angeles,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThese last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy. My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another \u2014 that\u2019s what makes this the greatest city in the world.\u201d",
      "Fans and lawmakers have called upon the Dodgers for several days to make an unequivocal statement of opposition to the raids, given their vast Latino fan base and heavy influence in the region. Other teams in the region have expressed their solidarity with the immigrant community, including Los Angeles FC and Angel City FC.",
      "U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area, went on social media earlier Friday to ask the Dodgers to speak up.",
      "\u201cIn a city where 36% of the residents are immigrants and nearly 40% of the team's fan base is Latino, saying nothing is not just disappointing \u2014 it's a betrayal and an insult,\u201d Gomez wrote. \u201cSilence is not an option. It's a choice.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving cybercriminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",

      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "NEW YORK -- An Australian moth follows the stars during its yearly migration, using the night sky as a guiding compass, according to a new study.",
      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",
      "It's an impressive feat for Bogong moths whose brains are smaller than size of a grain of rice to rely on the night sky for their odyssey, said study author David Dreyer with Lund University in Sweden.",
      "\u201cIt's remarkable that an animal with such a tiny brain can actually do this,\u201d Dreyer said.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk \u2019s X sued Tuesday to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms handle problematic posts \u2014 a regulatory approach that the company successfully challenged in California.",
      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",
      "New York is improperly trying \u201cto inject itself into the content-moderation editorial process\u201d by requiring \u201cpolitically charged disclosures\u201d about it, Bastrop, Texas-based X Corp. argues in the suit.",
      "\u201cThe state is impermissibly trying to generate public controversy about content moderation in a way that will pressure social media companies, such as X Corp., to restrict, limit, disfavor or censor certain constitutionally protected content on X that the state dislikes,\u201d says the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency said in a statement it recorded the volcano unleashing 10,000 meters (about 32,800 feet) of thick grey clouds on Tuesday afternoon, following significant volcanic activities, including 50 in two hours, rather than the usual daily 8 to 10 activities.",
      "The ashes expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud that could be seen from the cities located 90 kilometers (about 56 miles) to 150 kilometers (nearly 93 miles) from the mountain.",
      "There were no casualties reported.",
      "Residents were warned to be vigilant about heavy rainfall triggering lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.",
      "An eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in November killed nine people and injured dozens. It also erupted in March.",
      "The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) mountain is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the district of Flores Timur.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of 270 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",

      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats known as \u201cVoyagers\u201d have been put into service by the Danish Armed Forces for a three-month trial",
      "KOGE MARINA, Denmark -- From a distance they look almost like ordinary sailboats, their sails emblazoned with the red-and-white flag of Denmark.",
      "But these 10-meter (30-foot) -long vessels carry no crew and are designed for surveillance.",
      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats, known as \u201cVoyagers,\u201d have been put into service by Denmark's armed forces for a three-month operational trial.",
      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",
      "The Danish Defense Ministry says the trial is aimed at boosting surveillance capacity in under-monitored waters, especially around critical undersea infrastructure such as fiber-optic cables and power lines.",
      "\u201cThe security situation in the Baltic is tense,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Kim J\u00f8rgensen, the director of Danish National Armaments at the ministry. \u201cThey\u2019re going to cruise Danish waters, and then later they\u2019re going to join up with the two that are on (the) NATO exercise. And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO member. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Western officials accuse Russia of behind behind a string of hybrid war attacks on land and at sea.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defense College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a layered system that will enable us to keep constant monitoring of potential threats, but at a much cheaper level than before,\u201d he added.",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic-controlled state House on Friday approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles commonly referred to as assault weapons.",
      "The proposal now heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports assault weapons bans. If the bill is signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 states that have some sort of prohibition on high-powered firearms that were once banned nationwide and are now largely the weapon of choice among those responsible for most of the country\u2019s devastating mass shootings.",
      "Gun control advocates have been pushing for an assault weapons ban in Rhode Island for more than a decade. However, despite being a Democratic stronghold, lawmakers throughout the country\u2019s smallest state have long quibbled over the necessity and legality of such proposals.",
      "The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons and not possession. Only Washington state has a similar law. Residents looking to purchase an assault weapon from nearby New Hampshire or elsewhere will also be blocked. Federal law prohibits people from traveling to a different state to purchase a gun and returning it to a state where that particular of weapon is banned.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have bans on the possession of assault weapons, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Hawaii bans assault pistols.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak described the bill during floor debates Friday as an incremental move that brings Rhode Island in line with neighboring states.",
      "\u201cI am gravely disappointed we are not doing more, and we should do more,\" she said. \"And given the opportunity to do this or nothing, I am voting to do something.\u201d",
      "Critics of Rhode Island\u2019s proposed law argued that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish people with such rifles.",
      "\u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t go after criminals, it just puts the burden on law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino.",
      "Republican Rep. Michael Chippendale, House minority leader, predicted that if the legislation were to become law, the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually deem it unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cWe are throwing away money on this,\" he said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just Republicans who opposed the legislation. David Hogg \u2014 a gun control advocate who survived the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida \u2014 and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence described the proposed ban as the \u201cweakest assault weapons ban in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that Rhode Islanders deserve a strong bill that not only bans the sale, but also the possession of assault weapons. It is this combination that equals public safety,\u201d Hogg said in a statement.",
      "Elisabeth Ryan, policy counsel at Everytown for Gun Safety, rejected claims that the proposed law is weak.",
      "\u201cThe weakest law is what Rhode Island has now, no ban on assault weapons,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis would create a real, enforceable ban on the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, just like the law already working in Washington state, getting them off the shelves of Rhode Island gun stores once and for all.\u201d",
      "Nationally, assault weapons bans have been challenged in court by gun rights groups that argue the bans violate the Second Amendment. AR-15-style firearms are among the best-selling rifles in the country.",
      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court may soon take up the issue. The justices declined to hear a challenge to Maryland\u2019s assault weapons ban in early June, but three conservative justices \u2014 Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas \u2014 publicly noted their disagreement. A fourth, Brett Kavanaugh, indicated he was skeptical that the bans are constitutional and predicted the court would hear a case \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",

Trump has denied all allegations.",
      "On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's attempt to have the government substitute for him as a party in the case -- leading his attorneys to argue that they should be allowed to appeal before oral arguments take place next week.",

      "Trump said Thursday, via White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, that he believes there's a \"substantial chance of negotiations\" between Israel and Iran, and will make a decision on escalations within the next two weeks.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized American involvement in wars overseas and vowed to shift the focus inward, but as he weighs whether the U.S. will be involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran, some of his supporters have accused him of going back on his anti-interventionist stance.",
      "\"Among the America First base -- which is the core of his base -- there is tremendous anger and a severe sense of betrayal,\" Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the noninterventionist foreign policy think tank Quincy Institute, told ABC News Wednesday. \"This is exactly the type of foreign policy Trump had promised to end, not boost.\"",
      "Marjorie Taylor Greene, a key supporter and Trump ally on Capitol Hill, also dismissed the more hawkish members of her party as not authentically \"MAGA.\"",
      "\"Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA,\" Greene wrote in a Facebook post on June 15. \"We are sick and tired of foreign wars. All of them.\"",
      "Some Republicans are attempting to preempt military action through legislative means. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie announced on Tuesday that he had introduced a bill with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to prevent Trump from involving the U.S. army in \"unauthorized hostilities\" in Iran. Twenty-three representatives have now signed onto the bill -- including many from the progressive \"squad\" of the Democratic party.",

      "Justin Logan, director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told ABC News that some Republicans were pushing back against U.S. involvement because they \"realize that there's a real prospect that this could cave in their political coalition and do great damage to the Republican Party.\"",
      "\"There's not a lot of evidence that the MAGA base is excited about another major war in the Middle East,\" Logan said. \"I think the president, this is his last term, he's listening to some people that have some wild and crazy ideas about U.S. policy in the Middle East, and he doesn't share their concern.\"",

    "summary": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson unloaded on her Supreme Court colleagues in a series of sharp dissents, castigating a \"pure textualism\" approach to interpreting laws.",
    "story": [
      "She said the court gives the perception that \"moneyed interests\" are favored.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson unloaded on her Supreme Court colleagues Friday in a series of sharp dissents, castigating what she called a \"pure textualism\" approach to interpreting laws, which she said had become a pretext for securing their desired outcomes, and implying the conservative justices have strayed from their oath by showing favoritism to \"moneyed interests.\"",
      "The attack on the court's conservative majority by the junior justice and member of the liberal wing is notably pointed and aggressive but stopped short of getting personal. It laid bare the stark divisions on the court and pent-up frustration in the minority over what Jackson described as inconsistent and unfair application of precedent by those in power.",
      "Jackson took particular aim at Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion in a case brought by a retired Florida firefighter with Parkinson's disease who had tried to sue under the Americans with Disabilities Act after her former employer, the City of Sanford, canceled extended health insurance coverage for retirees who left the force before serving 25 years because of a disability.",
      "Gorsuch wrote that the landmark law only protects \"qualified individuals\" and that retirees don't count. The ADA defines the qualified class as those who \"can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\"",
      "\"This court has long recognized that the textual limitations upon a law's scope must be understood as no less a part of its purpose than its substantive authorizations,\" Gorsuch concluded in his opinion in Stanley v. City of Sanford. It was joined by all the court's conservatives and liberal Justice Elena Kagan.",
      "Jackson fired back, accusing her colleagues of reaching a \"stingy outcome\" and willfully ignoring the \"clear design of the ADA to render a ruling that plainly counteracts what Congress meant to -- and did -- accomplish\" with the law. She said they had \"run in a series of textualist circles\" and that the majority \"closes its eyes to context, enactment history and the legislature's goals.\"",
      "\"I cannot abide that narrow-minded approach,\" she wrote.",
      "Gorsuch retorted that Jackson was simply complaining textualism didn't get her the outcome she wanted, prompting Jackson to take the rare step of using a lengthy footnote to accuse her colleague of the same.",
      "Saying the majority has a \"unfortunate misunderstanding of the judicial role,\" Jackson said her colleagues' \"refusal\" to consider Congress' intent behind the ADA \"turns the interpretative task into a potent weapon for advancing judicial policy preferences.\"",
      "\"By 'finding' answers in ambiguous text,\" she wrote, \"and not bothering to consider whether those answers align with other sources of statutory meaning, pure textualists can easily disguise their own preferences.\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined parts of Jackson's dissent, explicitly did not sign-on to the footnote.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the liberal wing, joined the conservative majority in all three cases in which Jackson dissented, but she did not explain her views. In 2015, Kagan famously said, \"we're all textualists now\" of the court, but years later disavowed that approach over alleged abuse by conservative jurists.",
      "In two other cases decided Friday, Jackson accused her colleagues of distorting the law to benefit major American businesses and in so doing \"erode the public trust.\"",
      "She dissented from Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion siding with major tobacco manufacturer, R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., that gives retailers the ability to sue the Food and Drug Administration over the denial of new product applications for e-cigarettes.",
      "Barrett concluded that a federal law meant to regulate the manufacture and distribution of new tobacco products also allows retailers who would sell the products to seek judicial review of an adverse FDA decision.",
      "Jackson blasted the conclusion as \"illogical\" again taking her colleagues to task for not sufficiently considering Congress' intent or longstanding precedent. \"Every available indictor reveals that Congress intended to permit manufacturers -- not retailers -- to challenge the denial,\" she wrote.",
      "Of the court's 7-2 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, giving gasoline producers the right to sue California over limits on emission-producing cars, Jackson said her colleagues were favoring the fuel industry over \"less powerful plaintiffs.\"",
      "\"This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,\" she wrote.",
      "Jackson argued that the case should have been mooted, since the Trump administration withdrew EPA approval for California's emissions standards thereby eliminating any alleged harm to the auto and fuel industry.",
      "\"Those of us who are privileged to work inside the Court must not lose sight of this institution's unique mission and responsibility: to rule without fear or favor,\" she wrote, admonishing her colleagues.",
      "The court is next scheduled to convene Thursday, June 26, to release another round of opinions in cases argued this term. Decisions are expected in a dispute over online age verification for adult websites, parental opt-out rights for kids in public schools exposed to LGBTQ themes, and, the scope of nationwide injunctions against President Donald Trump's second-term policies.",

      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump -- clearly frustrated by the failure of his diplomatic efforts to date -- has raised the prospect of entirely abandoning American engagement.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. still provides around 30% of Ukraine's weaponry, Zelenskyy has said.",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump -- frustrated by the failure of his diplomatic efforts to date -- has raised the prospect of entirely abandoning U.S. engagement in Russia's 3-year-old invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"Sometimes you see two young children fighting in the park,\" Trump said in June about the ongoing war, which is the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "\"Sometimes you're better off letting them fight more before you pull them apart,\" the president added -- his remarks the latest in several months of public skepticism over the U.S. continuing to back Ukraine.",
      "In practice and rhetoric, American aid to Ukraine appears to be drying up. The administration approved a $50 million sale of military aid to Ukraine in April, but only after Kyiv signed off on a controversial minerals sharing deal. But the White House is also yet to dip into some $3.9 billion earmarked to fund military aid to Ukraine -- to be drawn from existing U.S. stocks, meaning it can be delivered quickly -- that Biden was not able to spend before the end of his term.",
      "It would be Russia that would benefit from a permanent halt to U.S. aid, Ukraine has warned.",
      "\"Without American weaponry, the situation on the battlefield will of course be more difficult,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News.",
      "Zelenskyy said early this year that American aid accounts for 30% of Ukrainian weaponry. Though other estimates go as low as 20%, it is clear that Washington remains a key benefactor.",
      "A nine-month pause on U.S. aid in 2024, due to a gridlocked Congress, forced Kyiv to consider a future without American assistance. Those fears materialized in March 2025 when Trump imposed a week-long freeze on all American military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.",
      "The flow soon resumed, but Trump's frustration has only deepened as U.S.-brokered peace talks floundered.",
      "The U.S. remained the most generous single contributor of aid to Ukraine as of April 2025, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group based in Germany that tracks support from foreign governments toward Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. has contributed around $130 billion in total aid to Ukraine since 2022, of which $74 billion is military assistance. Combined, European Union nations have contributed more overall -- $157 billion -- but less than the U.S. on the military front, at slightly less than $73 billion.",
      "Ukraine's budget for military and security spending approved by lawmakers in late 2024 was around $53.7 billion.",
      "Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., told ABC News that American military assistance is important but not vital.",
      "\"I wouldn't underestimate it, but I wouldn't overestimate it either,\" he said. Around half of American weapons systems and ammunition provided could be replaced by alternatives, he said.",
      "How to find replacements for weapons the U.S. would withhold may be the most salient question, Pavel Luzin -- an analyst at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts -- told ABC News.",
      "\"The previous administration decided that the American taxpayers should\" shoulder the burden, he said. \"The current administration wants to share this burden.\"",
      "\"Europe can pay for the American arms for Ukraine and it has enough money for this,\" Luzin said. \"Ukraine also can pay for the arms using long-term European and/or American loans. Even the Russian frozen assets could be used for this purpose.\"",
      "Europe has been criticized for its slow mobilization of its vast resources. But Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and the founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told ABC News, \"I think we saw during the during the pandemic, for example, and after the Russian invasion, that Europe is initially slow to act, but then it can act decisively.\"",
      "Perhaps the most vital single U.S. weapon system now in Ukrainian hands is the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has proven its value in downing drones, ballistic missiles and Russian aircraft since arriving in the country in the spring of 2023.",
      "Ukraine now fields at least six Patriots, two of which were provided by the U.S. and the others by different NATO allies.",
      "Ukraine has other air defense platforms -- among them the European IRIS-T and SAMP-T systems -- but none have been so publicly celebrated by Ukraine for blunting Russian attacks. The system, which entered U.S. service in the 1980s, has even been able to shoot down Russian hypersonic missiles.",
      "Zelenskyy said this month that his nation needs to \"urgently\" strengthen its air defense capabilities in response to Russia's intensifying missile and drone attacks on cities nationwide.",
      "\"We urgently need positive signals from the United States -- concrete signals regarding air defense systems,\" he said. \"We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help -- concrete signals, not words.\"",
      "Danylyuk said air defense is one area in which American support is particularly key.",
      "American-made defenses help enhance Kyiv's security in particular, he said. Without them, \"Kyiv would be hit in the same way as Odesa or Zaporizhizha,\" Danylyuk said.",
      "\"That's not nice. It will make life -- especially for Western diplomats including the U.S. diplomats -- much worse,\" he continued. \"Will it change our will to fight? No. There will be more civilians dying, that's the only difference.\"",
      "Behind and far above the front line, America's enormous intelligence capabilities have also been helping Kyiv resist Russia's war. American reconnaissance flights over eastern Europe, for example, have offered Kyiv otherwise unattainable forewarning on Russian activity and assistance in targeting.",
      "The Center for Strategic and International Studies said in May that U.S. intelligence aid has been \"extensive,\" including signals, imagery and human intelligence. \"This support has enabled Ukraine to counter missile barrages, disrupt covert operations and track force movements,\" CSIS wrote.",
      "Notably, Ukraine's air raid alerts are heavily informed by U.S. satellite data. When intelligence sharing was frozen in March, Ukrainian politicians warned that the result would be more dead civilians from Russia's nightly barrages.",
      "Shell hunger has also been a major problem for both sides throughout the war. Russia has turned to North Korea and Iran for sustenance, while Ukraine has turned to the West. During President Joe Biden's term, the U.S. sent more than 3 million 155mm shells to Ukraine. Any loss of supply could prove deadly for frontline Ukrainian units.",
      "The disappearance of other weapons from the battlefields would serve as a potent signal of an American pivot.",
      "Kyiv relies on the U.S. for ammunition for the HIMARS rocket artillery system, for example, including the long-range ATACMS.",
      "British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile, Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs, M777 howitzers, AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles and F-16 fighter jets are all systems either produced by the U.S. or relying on American components and systems -- thus giving Washington power to veto their transfer to Kyiv.",
      "An end to American aid, Danylyuk said, \"Would create some problems,\" though would not \"be a complete disaster\" if Kyiv is able to quickly source replacements.",
      "Regardless, \"Ukraine is not going to collapse,\" Danylyuk said, recalling the two past windows during which American aid flows froze over.",
      "\"We could survive that terrible nine months without U.S. aid. So, it's not like Ukrainians are going to surrender.\"",

      "The remarks, appearing to be made in jest, came after a reporter asked the president about his administration's deportation efforts.",
      "\"We're taking them out by the thousands. Murderers, drug dealers, people that are mentally insane, from insane asylums,\" Trump began before turning to the row of hard hat-wearing construction workers standing behind him during the press conference.",
      "\"Do we have anybody here who's a member of -- no, I don't think so. You've known these people for a long time?\" he asked. \"Any illegal immigrants?\"",

      "Trump's comments come as the president has instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to do \"all in their power\" to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history.",

    "summary": "The White House says Iran has all it needed to produce a nuclear weapon in \"a couple of weeks\" once given the go-ahead from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
    "story": [
      "It has everything it needs to do so now, Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "The White House on Thursday stated definitively that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in \"a couple of weeks\" once given the go-ahead from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\"Let's be very clear, Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at her briefing. \"All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that.\"",
      "\"And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would, of course, pose an existential threat not just to Israel but to the United States and to the entire world,\" she continued.",
      "How close Iran is to developing a usable nuclear weapon has been at the center of the Israel-Iran conflict, with continuing debate over the potential \"breakout timeline\" once the nation has stockpiled enough weapons-grade enriched uranium.",
      "The last time the U.S. gave an official, public breakout timeline was in July 2024 when then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it would take Iran one to two weeks to enrich enough uranium of 90% purity to get the fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"Once you're at 60 [percent enrichment], you're 90% of the way there. You are, in essence, a threshold nuclear weapons state, which is what Iran basically has become,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last month.",
      "But if Iran were to produce enough weapons-grade uranium, most experts estimate it would take Iran between several months to two years to actually make a deliverable nuclear warhead.",
      "In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community concluded the Iranians were not \"building\" a nuclear bomb and that the supreme leader had not yet authorized one to be built.",
      "Trump, when asked about Gabbard's testimony this week, dismissed it, saying: \"I don\u2019t care what she said, I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard then insisted she and Trump were on the same page -- that Iran was \"close\" to obtaining a weapon -- and that her testimony was misconstrued.",
      "The intelligence community, though, did assess that Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was at its highest level and was unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons, Gabbard testified.",
      "All eyes are on what Trump will do next as Israel and Iran continue to trade strikes, which Israel said it will intensify after an Iranian missile hit a hospital in Beersheba.",
      "The White House said on Thursday he would make a choice on whether to take military action against Tehran within the next two weeks.",
      "\"'Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.' That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Trump's met with advisers in the Situation Room three times this week after departing the G7 summit early due to tensions in the Middle East. He approved attack plans presented to him but was waiting to see if Iran would be willing to negotiate and hasn't made a final decision, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "He's set for another Situation Room meeting on Friday before attending a private fundraiser that night in Bedminster, New Jersey, before returning to the White House Saturday afternoon where he will get more intelligence briefings that evening and Sunday evening.",
      "Leavitt said that Trump's decision would be partly based on his \"instincts\" as he faces different pressures from all sides, including a split in his Republican base between isolationists and Israel hawks.",
      "\"Look, the president hears all voices across the country, and he makes decisions based on his instincts,\" Leavitt said. \"And he has always said diplomacy is his first option.\"",
      "ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Leavitt what made Trump believe there's a substantial chance for negotiation, but Leavitt declined to lay out his thinking.",
      "\"I'm not going to get into the reasoning and the rationale,\" she said. \"The president believes that, but that's his position and he will make a decision within the next two weeks.\"",
      "The White House said correspondence has continued between the United States and the Iranians, though it wasn't tracking whether U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff would attend talks in Geneva between European leaders and the Iranians.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel on Thursday made strong statements saying Iran's supreme leader cannot continue to \"exist\" -- prompting questions of whether Israel now wants regime change in Iran. Leavitt was asked on Thursday whether the U.S. would get involved in such a scenario.",
      "\"The president's top priority right now is ensuring that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon and providing peace and stability in the Middle East,\" Leavitt said.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",

      "House and Senate Republicans are taking different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.",
      "Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.",
      "The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.",
      "While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:",
      "The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.",
      "The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.",
      "The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.",
      "Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.",
      "The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.",
      "The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that\u2019s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.",
      "The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.",
      "The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.",
      "And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.",
      "Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.",
      "The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.",
      "The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.",
      "The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.",
      "The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.",
      "Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.",
      "Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.",
      "\u201cThis needs a lot of work. It\u2019s really concerning and I\u2019m really surprised by it,\u201d he said. \u201cRural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.\u201d",
      "The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.",
      "The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.",
      "The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.",
      "Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.",

      "As the United Nations marks its 80th anniversary, its humanitarian operations are increasingly in doubt as its top donor \u2014 the United States \u2014 has cut funding under the Trump administration and some other top Western countries have followed suit",
      "KAKUMA, Kenya -- At a refugee camp in northern Kenya, Aujene Cimanimpaye waits as a hot lunch of lentils and sorghum is ladled out for her and her nine children \u2014 all born while she has received United Nations assistance since fleeing her violence-wracked home in Congo in 2007.",
      "\u201cWe cannot go back home because people are still being killed,\u201d the 41-year-old said at the Kakuma camp, where the U.N. World Food Program and U.N. refugee agency help support more than 300,000 refugees.",
      "Her family moved from Nakivale Refugee Settlement in neighboring Uganda three years ago to Kenya, now home to more than a million refugees from dozens of conflict-hit east African countries.",
      "A few kilometers (miles) away at the Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement, fellow Congolese refugee Bahati Musaba, a mother of five, said that since 2016, \u201cU.N. agencies have supported my children\u2019s education \u2014 we get food and water and even medicine,\u201d as well as cash support from WFP to buy food and other basics.",
      "This year, those cash transfers \u2014 and many other U.N. aid activities \u2014 have stopped, threatening to upend or jeopardize millions of lives.",
      "As the U.N. marks its 80th anniversary this month, its humanitarian agencies are facing one of the greatest crises in their history: The biggest funder \u2014 the United States \u2014 under the Trump administration and other Western donors have slashed international aid spending. Some want to use the money to build up national defense.",
      "Some U.N. agencies are increasingly pointing fingers at one another as they battle over a shrinking pool of funding, said a diplomat from a top donor country who spoke on condition of anonymity to comment freely about the funding crisis faced by some U.N. agencies.",
      "Such pressures, humanitarian groups say, diminish the pivotal role of the U.N. and its partners in efforts to save millions of lives \u2014 by providing tents, food and water to people fleeing unrest in places like Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, or helping stamp out smallpox decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most abrupt upheaval of humanitarian work in the U.N. in my 40 years as a humanitarian worker, by far,\u201d said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. humanitarian aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cAnd it will make the gap between exploding needs and contributions to aid work even bigger.\u201d",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked the heads of U.N. agencies to find ways to cut 20% of their staffs, and his office in New York has floated sweeping ideas about reform that could vastly reshape the way the United Nations doles out aid.",
      "Humanitarian workers often face dangers and go where many others don\u2019t \u2014 to slums to collect data on emerging viruses or drought-stricken areas to deliver water.",
      "The U.N. says 2024 was the deadliest year for humanitarian personnel on record, mainly due to the war in Gaza. In February, it suspended aid operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have detained dozens of U.N. and other aid workers.",
      "Proponents say U.N. aid operations have helped millions around the world affected by poverty, illness, conflict, hunger and other troubles.",
      "Critics insist many operations have become bloated, replete with bureaucratic perks and a lack of accountability, and are too distant from in-the-field needs. They say postcolonial Western donations have fostered dependency and corruption, which stifles the ability of countries to develop on their own, while often U.N.-backed aid programs that should be time-specific instead linger for many years with no end in sight.",
      "In the case of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning WFP and the U.N.\u2019s refugee and migration agencies, the U.S. has represented at least 40% of their total budgets, and Trump administration cuts to roughly $60 billion in U.S. foreign assistance have hit hard. Each U.N. agency has been cutting thousands of jobs and revising aid spending.",
      "\u201cIt's too brutal what has happened,\u201d said Egeland, alluding to cuts that have jolted the global aid community. \u201cHowever, it has forced us to make priorities ... what I hope is that we will be able to shift more of our resources to the front lines of humanity and have less people sitting in offices talking about the problem.\u201d",
      "With the U.N. Security Council's divisions over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East hindering its ability to prevent or end conflict in recent years, humanitarian efforts to vaccinate children against polio or shelter and feed refugees have been a bright spot of U.N. activity. That's dimming now.",
      "Aside from the cuts and dangers faced by humanitarian workers, political conflict has at times overshadowed or impeded their work.",
      "UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees, has delivered an array of services to millions \u2014 food, education, jobs and much more \u2014 in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as well as in the West Bank and Gaza since its founding in 1948.",
      "Israel claims the agency's schools fan antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiment, which the agency denies. Israel says Hamas siphons off U.N. aid in Gaza to profit from it, while U.N. officials insist most aid gets delivered directly to the needy.",
      "\u201cUNRWA is like one of the foundations of your home. If you remove it, everything falls apart,\u201d said Issa Haj Hassan, 38, after a checkup at a small clinic at the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.",
      "UNRWA covers his diabetes and blood pressure medication, as well as his wife\u2019s heart medicine. The United States, Israel's top ally, has stopped contributing to UNRWA; it once provided a third of its funding. Earlier this year, Israel banned the aid group, which has strived to continue its work nonetheless.",
      "Ibtisam Salem, a single mother of five in her 50s who shares a small one-room apartment in Beirut with relatives who sleep on the floor, said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for UNRWA we would die of starvation. ... They helped build my home, and they give me health care. My children went to their schools.\u201d",
      "Especially when it comes to food and hunger, needs worldwide are growing even as funding to address them shrinks.",
      "\u201cThis year, we have estimated around 343 million acutely food insecure people,\u201d said Carl Skau, WFP deputy executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a threefold increase if we compare four years ago. And this year, our funding is dropping 40%. So obviously that\u2019s an equation that doesn\u2019t come together easily.\u201d",
      "Billing itself as the world's largest humanitarian organization, WFP has announced plans to cut about a quarter of its 22,000 staff.",
      "One question is how the United Nations remains relevant as an aid provider when global cooperation is on the outs, and national self-interest and self-defense are on the upswing.",
      "The United Nations is not alone: Many of its aid partners are feeling the pinch. Groups like GAVI, which tries to ensure fair distribution of vaccines around the world, and the Global Fund, which spends billions each year to help battle HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have been hit by Trump administration cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Some private-sector, government-backed groups also are cropping up, including the divisive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been providing some food to Palestinians. But violence has erupted as crowds try to reach the distribution sites.",
      "No private-sector donor or well-heeled country \u2014 China and oil-rich Gulf states are often mentioned by aid groups \u2014 have filled the significant gaps from shrinking U.S. and other Western spending.",
      "The future of U.N. aid, experts say, will rest where it belongs \u2014 with the world body's 193 member countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to take that debate back into our countries, into our capitals, because it is there that you either empower the U.N. to act and succeed \u2014 or you paralyze it,\u201d said Achim Steiner, administrator of the U.N. Development Program.",

      "A New Hampshire city that served as the backdrop for \u201cJumanji\u201d is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the film this weekend",
      "Madeline Murphy remembers the instructions she was given on the set of \u201cJumanji\u201d when she was an extra some 30 years ago: \u201cPretend you\u2019re frightened and you\u2019re screaming because an elephant\u2019s coming after you.\u201d",
      "So, that's what she did in the Central Square of Keene, New Hampshire, running back and forth, over and over, on a long day in November 1994.",
      "\u201cI was pretty tired by the end of the day, and it was cold,\" said Murphy, 61. She got a check for $60.47 \u2014 and several seconds of screen time.",
      "Murphy was one of about 125 extras cast in the classic Robin Williams film, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It's spawned several sequels, including one planned for next year. The city of about 23,000 people in the southwestern corner of the state is celebrating its ties to \u201cJumanji\u201d this weekend.",
      "A featured event is a \u201cRhino Rumble Road Race\u201d saluting the film\u2019s stampede scenes of elephants, rhinos and zebras on Saturday. Runners in inflatable animal costumes are sprinting about a quarter mile (less than half a kilometer) around the square.",
      "There's also a cast party, a parade, and a scavenger hunt, among other events.",
      "Based on the 1981 children\u2019s book by Chris Van Allsburg about a mysterious jungle adventure board game, the movie version of \u201cJumanji\u201d is set in the fictional small town of Brantford, New Hampshire.",
      "Veteran location manager Dow Griffith was crisscrossing New England in search of the right spot. A coffee lover who grew up in Seattle, he recalled feeling desperate one day for a good brew. He was a bit east of Keene at the time, and someone suggested a shop that was near the square.",
      "\u201cI took my cherished cup of double dry cappuccino out to the front porch, took a sip, looked to my left \u2014 and by God \u2014 there was the place I had been looking for!\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cSo really, we have coffee to thank for the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Scenes were filmed at the square that fall and the following spring. The fall scenes show a present-day town that had declined. Extras played homeless people and looters, in addition to panicked runners fleeing from the jungle animals.",
      "Joanne Hof, now 78, had needed her son's help to spot herself behind the elephants, running with her hands up. Hof, a reading specialist, bought a videotape of \u201cJumanji\u201d and showed it to the kids she worked with.",
      "\u201cThey were very impressed that I was in the movie,\u201d she said.",
      "The spring scenes, appearing early in the film, depict the town in 1969. Extras drove classic cars around the pristine-looking square and others walked around, dressed for that time period.",
      "\u201cI told the makeup person, \u2018Do you know how to do a French twist?\u2019\" recalled Kate Beetle, 74, of Alstead, who said she can be seen for \"a micro-second\" crossing a street. \u201cThey just found me the right lady's suit and right flat shoes, and then the hair is kind of what I suspect did it.\u201d",
      "The \u201cJumanji\u201d crews worked well with the city in getting the permits to transform Central Square into a dilapidated, neglected piece of public property, recalled Patty Little, who recently retired as Keene's clerk.",
      "\u201cThey brought in old, dead shrubbery and threw it around and made the paint peel on the gazebo,\u201d she said. Items such as parking meters and lilac bushes were removed and a large Civil War-era statue was brought in to cover a fountain. Graffiti was on the walls and crumpled vehicles in the stampede scene were anchored in place.",
      "Everything was restored, and fresh flowers were brought in the following spring, she said.",
      "Crews spent a total of about a week in the city for both settings.",
      "Little, whose classic 1961 Ambassador is caught on camera, could see everything happening from her office window.",
      "\u201cDid I get a lot of work done? I don\u2019t know during those days,\u201d she said.",
      "A crowd turned out to watch a long-haired, bearded Williams run down the street in a leaf-adorned tunic. In the movie, he had just been freed from the game that had trapped him as a boy for years.",
      "\u201cHe's shorter than I thought he was!\u201d one viewer said, according to local chronicler Susan MacNeil's book, \u201cWhen Jumanji Came to Keene.\" Others said, \u201cHe has great legs \u2014 muscular, isn't he? But so hairy!\" and \u201cIsn't he freezing dressed like that?\"",
      "The mayor honored him with a key to the city. Williams, noticing the mayor was a bit shorter, suddenly announced at the presentation, \u201c'I am the mayor of Munchkinland,'\u201d with a voice to match, City Councilor Randy Filiault recalled.",
      "He stayed in character for 15 to 20 minutes, \u201cjust bouncing off the walls,\" approaching people in the audience and pulling their hats over their eyes. Eventually, he stopped, ending with a solemn \u201cThank you,\u201d Filiault said.",
      "\u201cI am really seeing something cool here,\u201d Filiault remembered thinking. \u201cHow fortunate we were.\u201d",

      "As the U.S. marks the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, it might take a moment \u2014 or more \u2014 to remember why",
      "NEW YORK -- As the U.S. marks the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, it might take a moment \u2014 or more \u2014 to remember why.",
      "Start with the very name.",
      "\u201cThere's something percussive about it: Battle of Bunker Hill,\u201d says prize-winning historian Nathaniel Philbrick, whose \u201cBunker Hill: A City, A Siege, A Revolution\u201d was published in 2013. \u201cWhat actually happened probably gets hazy for people outside of the Boston area, but it's part of our collective memory and imagination.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew \u2018ordinary\u2019 Americans could tell you that Freeman\u2019s Farm, or Germantown, or Guilford Court House were battles,\u201d says Paul Lockhart, a professor of history at Wright University and author of a Bunker Hill book, \u201cThe Whites of Their Eyes,\" which came out in 2011. \"But they can say that Gettysburg,D-Day, and Bunker Hill were battles.\u201d",
      "Bunker Hill, Lockhart adds, \u201cis the great American battle, if there is such a thing.\u201d",
      "Much of the world looks to the Battles of Lexington and Concord, fought in Massachusetts on April 19, 1775, as the start of the American Revolution. But Philbrick, Lockhart and others cite Bunker Hill and June 17 as the real beginning, the first time British and rebel forces faced off in sustained conflict over a specific piece of territory.",
      "Bunker Hill was an early showcase for two long-running themes in American history \u2014 improvisation and how an inspired band of militias could hold their own against an army of professionals.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrific bloodletting, and provided the British high command with proof that the Americans were going to be a lot more difficult to subdue than had been hoped,\u201d says the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Rick Atkinson, whose second volume of a planned trilogy on the Revolution, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d was published in April.",
      "The battle was born in part out of error; rebels were seeking to hold off a possible British attack by fortifying Bunker Hill, a 110-foot-high (34-meter-high) peak in Charlestown across the Charles River from British-occupied Boston. But for reasons still unclear, they instead armed a smaller and more vulnerable ridge known as Breed's Hill, \u201cwithin cannon shot of Boston,\u201d Philbrick says. \"The British felt they had no choice but to attack and seize the American fort.\u201d",
      "Abigail Adams, wife of future President John Adams, and son John Quincy Adams, also a future president, were among thousands in the Boston area who looked on from rooftops, steeples and trees as the two sides fought with primal rage. A British officer would write home about the \u201cshocking carnage\u201d left behind, a sight \u201cthat never will be erased out of my mind 'till the day of my death.\u201d",
      "The rebels were often undisciplined and disorganized and they were running out of gunpowder. The battle ended with them in retreat, but not before the British had lost more than 200 soldiers and sustained more than 1,000 casualties, compared to some 450 colonial casualties and the destruction of hundreds of homes, businesses and other buildings in Charlestown. Bunker Hill would become characteristic of so much of the Revolutionary War: a technical defeat that was a victory because the British needed to win decisively and the rebels needed only not to lose decisively.",
      "\u201cNobody now entertains a doubt but that we are able to cope with the whole force of Great Britain, if we are but willing to exert ourselves,\u201d Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend in early July. \u201cAs our enemies have found we can reason like men, now let us show them we can fight like men also.\u201d",

      "With the Trump administration aggressively trying to increase the number of immigration arrests, raids are now being conducted at all hours and more Americans are witnessing people being hauled off",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Adam Greenfield was home nursing a cold when his girlfriend raced in to tell him Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles were pulling up in their trendy San Diego neighborhood.",
      "The poet and podcast producer grabbed his iPhone and bolted out the door barefoot, joining a handful of neighbors recording masked agents raiding a popular Italian restaurant nearby, as they yelled at the officers to leave. An hour later, the crowd had grown to nearly 75 people, with many in front of the agents\u2019 vehicles.",
      "\u201cI couldn't stay silent,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cIt was literally outside of my front door.\u201d",
      "More Americans are witnessing people being hauled off as they shop, exercise at the gym, dine out and otherwise go about their daily lives as President Donald Trump's administration aggressively works to increase immigration arrests. As the raids touch the lives of people who aren\u2019t immigrants themselves, many Americans who rarely, if ever, participated in civil disobedience are rushing out to record the actions on their phones and launch impromptu protests.",
      "Greenfield said on the evening of the May 30 raid, the crowd included grandparents, retired military members, hippies, and restaurant patrons arriving for date night. Authorities threw flash bangs to force the crowd back and then drove off with four detained workers, he said.",
      "\u201cTo do this, at 5 o\u2019clock, right at the dinner rush, right on a busy intersection with multiple restaurants, they were trying to make a statement,\u201d Greenfield said. \"But I don\u2019t know if their intended point is getting across the way they want it to. I think it is sparking more backlash.\u201d",
      "Previously many arrests happened late at night or in the pre-dawn hours by agents waiting outside people's homes as they left for work or outside their work sites when they finished their day. When ICE raided another popular restaurant in San Diego in 2008, agents did it in the early morning without incident.",
      "White House border czar Tom Homan has said agents are being forced to do more arrests in communities because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with ICE in certain cities and states. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.",
      "Vice President JD Vance during a visit to Los Angeles on Friday said those policies have given agents \u201ca bit of a morale problem because they've had the local government in this community tell them that they're not allowed to do their job.\"",
      "\u201cWhen that Border Patrol agent goes out to do their job, they said within 15 minutes they have protesters, sometimes violent protesters who are in their face obstructing them,\u201d he said.",
      "Melyssa Rivas had just arrived at her office in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, California one morning last week when she heard the frightened screams of young women. She went outside to find the women confronting nearly a dozen masked federal agents who had surrounded a man kneeling on the pavement.",
      "\u201cIt was like a scene out of a movie,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cThey all had their faces covered and were standing over this man who was clearly traumatized. And there are these young girls screaming at the top of their lungs.\u201d",
      "As Rivas began recording the interaction, a growing group of neighbors shouted at the agents to leave the man alone. They eventually drove off in vehicles, without detaining him, video shows.",
      "Rivas spoke to the man afterward, who told her the agents had arrived at the car wash where he worked that morning, then pursued him as he fled on his bicycle. It was one of several recent workplace raids in the majority-Latino city.",
      "The same day, federal agents were seen at a Home Depot, a construction site and an LA Fitness gym. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people had been detained.",
      "\u201cEveryone is just rattled,\u201d said Alex Frayde, an employee at LA Fitness who said he saw the agents outside the gym and stood at the entrance, ready to turn them away as another employee warned customers about the sighting. In the end, the agents never came in.",
      "Arrests at immigration courts and other ICE buildings have also prompted emotional scenes as masked agents have turned up to detain people going to routine appointments and hearings.",
      "In the city of Spokane in rural eastern Washington state, hundreds of people rushed to protest outside an ICE building June 11 after former city councilor Ben Stuckart posted on Facebook. Stuckart wrote that he was a legal guardian of a Venezuelan asylum seeker who who went to check in at the ICE building only to be detained. His Venezuelan roommate was also detained.",
      "Both men had permission to live and work in the U.S. temporarily under humanitarian parole, Stuckart told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am going to sit in front of the bus,\u201d Stuckart wrote, referring to the van that was set to transport the two men to an ICE detention center in Tacoma. \u201cThe Latino community needs the rest of our community now. Not tonight, not Saturday but right now!!!!\u201d",
      "The city of roughly 230,000 is the seat of Spokane County, where just over half of voters cast ballots for Trump in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Stuckart was touched to see his mother\u2019s caregiver among the demonstrators.",
      "\u201cShe was just like, \u2018I\u2019m here because I love your mom, and I love you, and if you or your friends need help, then I want to help,\u2019\u201d he said through tears.",
      "By evening, the Spokane Police Department sent over 180 officers, with some using pepper balls, to disperse protesters. Over 30 people were arrested, including Stuckart who blocked the transport van with others. He was later released.",
      "Aysha Mercer, a stay-at-home mother of three, said she is \u201cnot political in any way, shape or form.\" But many children in her Spokane neighborhood -- who play in her yard and jump on her trampoline -- come from immigrant families, and the thought of them being affected by deportations was \u201cunacceptable,\" she said.",
      "She said she wasn't able to go to Stuckart's protest. But she marched for the first time in her life on June 14, joining millions in \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests across the country.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt as strongly as I do right this here second,\u201d she said.",

      "A holiday and a juror's illness shortened the sixth week of the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial as prosecutors nearly concluded their case, setting the stage for the defense presentation",
      "NEW YORK -- The sixth week of the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial was shortened by a holiday and a juror's illness as prosecutors nearly concluded their case, setting the stage for a one- or two-day defense presentation next week.",
      "In the trial's first five weeks, jurors repeatedly heard testimony about drug-fueled marathon sex events described as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d by one of Combs' ex-girlfriends and as \u201chotel nights\u201d by another. In the sixth week, they were shown about 20 minutes of video recordings from the dayslong events.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Entertainment, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges in the trial, which continues Monday.",
      "Here are key moments from the past week:",
      "Jurors largely kept their reactions muted when they were shown about 20 minutes of recordings made by Combs of his then-girlfriends having sex with male sex workers at the elaborately staged \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the events were proof of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges because Combs coerced his employees, associates and even his girlfriends to recruit and arrange flights for sex workers while his workers obtained drugs, stocked hotel rooms with baby oil, lubricant, condoms, candles and liquor and delivered cash.",
      "In her opening statement, defense lawyer Teny Geragos had called the videos \u201cpowerful evidence that the sexual conduct in this case was consensual and not based on coercion.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors played about 2 minutes of the recordings before the defense team aired about 18 minutes of the videos.",
      "The public and the press were unable to observe whether the prosecutors or defense lawyers had the better arguments after the judge ruled that neither the recordings nor the sound could be seen or heard by anyone except lawyers, the judge and the jury.",
      "Several jurors seemed to cast their eyes and sometimes turn their bodies away from the screens directly in front of them while the recordings played. The jurors listened through earphones supplied by the court, as did Combs and lawyers.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian started the week by dismissing a juror whose conflicting answers about whether he lived in New Jersey or New York convinced the judge he was a threat to the integrity of the trial.",
      "Subramanian said the juror's answers during jury selection and in the week before he was excused \u201craised serious concerns as to the juror\u2019s candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe inconsistencies \u2014 where the juror has lived and with whom \u2014 go to straightforward issues as to which there should not have been any doubts, and the answers also go to something vital: the basic qualifications of a juror to serve,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Residents of New Jersey would not be permitted to sit on a New York federal jury.",
      "A day before Subramanian ruled, defense lawyers argued fiercely against dismissal, saying that replacing the Black juror with a white alternate juror so late in the trial would change the diverse demographics of the jury and require a mistrial.",
      "The jurors are anonymous for the Combs trial.",
      "It wasn't the only issue regarding jurors for the week. The judge, angered by a media report about the questioning of another juror the week before that occurred in a sealed proceeding, warned lawyers that they could face civil and criminal sanctions if such a leak happened again. That juror was not dismissed.",
      "And Wednesday's court session had to be canceled after a juror reported \"vertigo symptoms\" on the way to the courthouse.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo seemed to close the door on any chance Combs would testify when he said Friday that the defense presentation would be finished Tuesday or Wednesday the following week, even if prosecutors don't rest until late Monday.",
      "It is not uncommon for defendants to choose not to testify at criminal trials. Besides being exposed to cross-examination by prosecutors, the testimony can be used by the government against the defendant should there be a need for a retrial. Also, if there is a conviction, the judge can conclude that the jury believed the defendant lied on the stand.",
      "Brendan Paul, fresh off the college basketball courts where he once played in a cameo role for Syracuse University, joined Combs' companies as a personal assistant in late 2022 and was warned by a friend who had worked for Combs about what was ahead.",
      "\u201cHe told me to get in and get out,\u201d Paul recalled for the jury, citing the endless days and always-on-edge existence. \u201cIf you have a girlfriend, break up with her. And you\u2019re never going to see your family.\u201d",
      "The friend also instructed him to \u201cbuild a rolodex of clientele and get out,\u201d he said.",
      "Paul said he worked 80 to 100 hours a week for a music power broker who received \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of text messages and emails a day. He was paid $75,000 salary initially, but it was raised in January 2024 to $100,000.",
      "He said Combs told him he \u201cdoesn't take no for an answer\u201d and wanted his staff to \u201cmove like Seal Team Six.\u201d",
      "Several times, Paul said, he picked up drugs for Combs and knew to keep his boss out of the drug trade because \u201cit was very important to keep his profile low. He's a celebrity.\u201d",
      "The job came to an abrupt end in March 2024 when Paul was arrested at a Miami airport on drug charges after a small amount of cocaine that he said he picked up in Combs' room that morning was mistakenly put in his travel bag as he prepared to join Combs on a trip to the Bahamas. The charges were later dropped in a pretrial diversion program.",
      "Paul said he hadn't seen Combs since.",

      "Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic-controlled state House has advanced legislation that would ban sales of certain semiautomatic rifles",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic-controlled state House on Friday approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles commonly referred to as assault weapons.",
      "The proposal now heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports assault weapons bans. If the bill is signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 states that have some sort of prohibition on high-powered firearms that were once banned nationwide and are now largely the weapon of choice among those responsible for most of the country\u2019s devastating mass shootings.",
      "Gun control advocates have been pushing for an assault weapons ban in Rhode Island for more than a decade. However, despite being a Democratic stronghold, lawmakers throughout the country\u2019s smallest state have long quibbled over the necessity and legality of such proposals.",
      "The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons and not possession. Only Washington state has a similar law. Residents looking to purchase an assault weapon from nearby New Hampshire or elsewhere will also be blocked. Federal law prohibits people from traveling to a different state to purchase a gun and returning it to a state where that particular of weapon is banned.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have bans on the possession of assault weapons, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Hawaii bans assault pistols.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak described the bill during floor debates Friday as an incremental move that brings Rhode Island in line with neighboring states.",
      "\u201cI am gravely disappointed we are not doing more, and we should do more,\" she said. \"And given the opportunity to do this or nothing, I am voting to do something.\u201d",
      "Critics of Rhode Island\u2019s proposed law argued that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish people with such rifles.",
      "\u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t go after criminals, it just puts the burden on law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino.",
      "Republican Rep. Michael Chippendale, House minority leader, predicted that if the legislation were to become law, the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually deem it unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cWe are throwing away money on this,\" he said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just Republicans who opposed the legislation. David Hogg \u2014 a gun control advocate who survived the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida \u2014 and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence described the proposed ban as the \u201cweakest assault weapons ban in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that Rhode Islanders deserve a strong bill that not only bans the sale, but also the possession of assault weapons. It is this combination that equals public safety,\u201d Hogg said in a statement.",
      "Elisabeth Ryan, policy counsel at Everytown for Gun Safety, rejected claims that the proposed law is weak.",
      "\u201cThe weakest law is what Rhode Island has now, no ban on assault weapons,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis would create a real, enforceable ban on the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, just like the law already working in Washington state, getting them off the shelves of Rhode Island gun stores once and for all.\u201d",
      "Nationally, assault weapons bans have been challenged in court by gun rights groups that argue the bans violate the Second Amendment. AR-15-style firearms are among the best-selling rifles in the country.",
      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court may soon take up the issue. The justices declined to hear a challenge to Maryland\u2019s assault weapons ban in early June, but three conservative justices \u2014 Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas \u2014 publicly noted their disagreement. A fourth, Brett Kavanaugh, indicated he was skeptical that the bans are constitutional and predicted the court would hear a case \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",

      "The document, which was obtained by The Associated Press, also said that more than 6,400 U.S. citizens in Israel had filled out an online form on Friday alone asking for information about when and if the U.S. government would organize evacuation flights. An additional 3,265 people, some of whom may also have competed the form, called an emergency number seeking assistance.",

      "There are some 700,000 Americans in Israel, many of them dual nationals, according to estimates, although the exact number at any given time is unclear because U.S. citizens are not required to notify the embassy if they are there or when they might leave.",
      "Earlier Friday, before the memo was distributed, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that more than 25,000 Americans had reached out for information on leaving Israel, the West Bank and Iran.",
      "She told reporters that those people had sought \u201cinformation and support\u201d and were \u201cseeking guidance\u201d on departing. She would not give a breakdown of where the queries had come from and would not comment on embassy evacuations.",

      "Vice President JD Vance is accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Vice President JD Vance on Friday accused California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests as he used his appearance in Los Angeles to rebut criticism from state and local officials that the Trump administration fueled the unrest by sending in federal officers.",
      "Vance also referred to U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, the state\u2019s first Latino senator, as \u201cJose Padilla,\u201d a week after the Democrat was forcibly taken to the ground by officers and handcuffed after speaking out during a Los Angeles news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on immigration raids.",
      "\u201cI was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,\u201d Vance said, in an apparent reference to the altercation at Noem\u2019s event. \u201cI guess he decided not to show up because there wasn\u2019t a theater. And that\u2019s all it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to be able to go back to their far-left groups and to say, \u2018Look, me, I stood up against border enforcement. I stood up against Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d Vance added.",
      "A spokesperson for Padilla, Tess Oswald, noted in a social media post that Padilla and Vance were formerly colleagues in the Senate and said that Vance should know better. \u201cHe should be more focused on demilitarizing our city than taking cheap shots,\u201d Oswald said.",
      "Vance\u2019s visit to Los Angeles to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center came as demonstrations calmed down in the city and a curfew was lifted this week. That followed over a week of sometimes-violent clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and looting that followed immigration raids across Southern California.",
      "Trump\u2019s dispatching of his top emissary to Los Angeles at a time of turmoil surrounding the Israel-Iran war and the U.S.\u2019s future role in it signals the political importance Trump places on his hard-line immigration policies. Vance echoed the president's harsh rhetoric toward California Democrats as he sought to blame them for the protests in the city.",
      "\u201cGavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,\u201d Vance said after he toured federal immigration enforcement offices.",
      "\u201cWhat happened here was a tragedy,\u201d Vance added. \u201cYou had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.\u201d",
      "Newsom\u2019s spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement, \u201cThe Vice President\u2019s claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.\u201d",
      "Speaking at City Hall, Bass said Vance was \u201cspewing lies and utter nonsense.\u201d She said hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted by the federal government on a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow dare you say that city officials encourage violence? We kept the peace,\u201d Bass said.",
      "In a statement on X, Newsom responded to Vance's reference to \u201cJose Padilla,\u201d saying the comment was no accident.",
      "Jose Padilla also is the name of a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter during President George W. Bush's administration, who was sentenced to two decades in prison. Padilla was arrested in 2002 at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport during the tense months after the 9/11 attacks and accused of the \u201cdirty bomb\u201d mission. It later emerged through U.S. interrogation of other al-Qaida suspects that the \u201cmission\u201d was only a sketchy idea, and those claims never surfaced in the South Florida terrorism case.",
      "Responding to the outrage, Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said of the vice president: \u201cHe must have mixed up two people who have broken the law.\u201d",
      "Federal immigration authorities have been ramping up arrests across the country to fulfill Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations. Todd Lyons, the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has defended his tactics against criticism that authorities are being too heavy-handed.",
      "The friction in Los Angeles began June 6, when federal agents conducted a series of immigration sweeps in the region that have continued since. Amid the protests and over the objections of state and local officials, Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city, home to 3.8 million people.",
      "Trump has said that without the military's involvement, Los Angeles \u201cwould be a crime scene like we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d",
      "Newsom has depicted the military intervention as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy.",
      "Earlier Friday, Newsom urged Vance to visit victims of the deadly January wildfires while in Southern California and talk with Trump, who earlier this week suggested his feud with the governor might influence his consideration of $40 billion in federal wildfire aid for California. \u201cI hope we get that back on track,\u201d Newsom wrote on X. \u201cWe are counting on you, Mr. Vice President.\u201d",
      "Vance did not mention either request during his appearance on Friday.",

      "President Donald Trump has moved on several fronts to block Harvard University\u2019s enrollment of international students as his administration presses its demands for a series of policy and governance changes at the Ivy League school",
      "President Donald Trump and his administration have tried several tactics to block Harvard University's enrollment of international students, part of the White House's effort to secure policy changes at the private, Ivy League college.",
      "Targeting foreign students has become the administration's cornerstone effort to crack down on the nation's oldest and wealthiest college. The block on international enrollment, which accounts for a quarter of Harvard's students and much of its global allure, strikes at the core of Harvard's identity. Courts have stopped some of the government's actions, at least for now \u2014 but not all.",
      "In the latest court order, a federal judge on Friday put one of those efforts on hold until a lawsuit is resolved. But the fate of Harvard's international students \u2014 and its broader standoff with the Trump administration \u2014 remain in limbo.",
      "Here are all the ways the Trump administration has moved to block Harvard's foreign enrollment \u2014 and where each effort stands.",
      "In May, the Trump administration tried to ban foreign students at Harvard, citing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s authority to oversee which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program. The program allows colleges to issue documents that foreign students need to study in the United States.",
      "Harvard filed a lawsuit, arguing the administration violated the government\u2019s own regulations for withdrawing a school\u2019s certification.",
      "Within hours, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston put the administration\u2019s ban on hold temporarily \u2014 an order that had an expiration date. On Friday, she issued a preliminary injunction, blocking Homeland Security's move until the case is decided. That could take months or longer.",
      "The government can and does remove colleges from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, making them ineligible to host foreign students on their campus. However, it\u2019s usually for administrative reasons outlined in law, such as failing to maintain accreditation, lacking proper facilities for classes, failing to employ qualified professional personnel \u2014 even failing to \u201coperate as a bona fide institution of learning.\u201d Other colleges are removed when they close.",
      "Notably, Burroughs' order Friday said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law. After Burroughs' emergency block in May, DHS issued a more typical \u201cNotice of Intent to Withdraw\u201d Harvard's participation in the international student visa program.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s order does not affect the DHS\u2019s ongoing administrative review,\u201d Harvard said Friday in a message to its international students. \u201cHarvard is fully committed to compliance with the applicable F-1 (student visa) regulations and strongly opposes any effort to withdraw the University\u2019s certification.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Trump himself moved to block entry to the United States for incoming Harvard students, issuing a proclamation that invoked a different legal authority.",
      "Harvard filed a court challenge attacking Trump\u2019s legal justification for the action \u2014 a federal law allowing him to block a \u201cclass of aliens\u201d deemed detrimental to the nation\u2019s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cclass of aliens,\u201d Harvard said in its filing.",
      "Harvard's lawyers asked the court to block the action. Burroughs agreed to pause the entry ban temporarily, without giving an expiration date. She has not yet ruled on Harvard's request for another preliminary injunction, which would pause the ban until the court case is decided. \u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard told international students Friday.",
      "At the center of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard are his assertions that the school has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment, especially during pro-Palestinian protests. In seeking to keep Harvard students from coming to the U.S., he said Harvard is not a suitable destination. Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism and will not submit to the administration\u2019s demands for further changes.",
      "In late May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed U.S. embassies and consulates to start reviewing social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.",
      "On Wednesday, the State Department said it was launching new vetting of social media accounts for foreigners applying for student visas, and not just those seeking to attend Harvard. Consular officers will be on the lookout for posts and messages that could be deemed hostile to the United States, its government, culture, institutions or founding principles, the department said, telling visa applicants to set their social media accounts to \u201cpublic.\u201d",
      "In reopening the visa process, the State Department also told consulates to prioritize students hoping to enroll at colleges where foreigners make up less than 15% of the student body, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail information that has not been made public.",
      "Foreign students make up more than 15% of the total student body at almost 200 U.S. universities \u2014 including Harvard and the other Ivy League schools, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal education data from 2023. Most are private universities, including all eight Ivy League schools.",
      "Some Harvard students are also caught up in the government's recent ban against travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle East. The Trump administration last weekend called for 36 additional countries to commit to improving vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States.",
      "Harvard sponsors more than 7,000 people on a combination of F-1 and J-1 visas, which are issued to students and to foreigners visiting the U.S. on exchange programs such as fellowships. Across all the schools that make up the university, about 26% of the student body is from outside the U.S.",
      "But some schools and programs, by nature of their subject matter, have significantly more international students. At the Harvard Kennedy School, which covers public policy and public administration, 49% of students are on F-1 visas. In the business school, one-third of students come from abroad. And within the law school, 94% of the students in the master\u2019s program in comparative law are international students.",
      "The administration has imposed a range of sanctions on Harvard since it rejected the government\u2019s demands for policy reforms related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Conservatives say the demands are merited, decrying Harvard as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. Harvard says the administration is illegally retaliating against the university.",

      "Air traffic controllers in Florida briefly lost their radar after a fiber optic line was cut, but the outage didn\u2019t lead to disruptions like what happened after similar outages around the Newark, New Jersey, airport this spring",
      "Air traffic controllers in Florida briefly lost their radar Friday after a fiber optic line was cut, but the outage didn't lead to disruptions like what happened after similar outages around the Newark, New Jersey, airport this spring.",
      "Controllers were able to continue directing planes across five states in the Southeast because a backup system kicked in immediately as designed. The Federal Aviation Administration said no flights were disrupted.",
      "The FAA said the radar center in Jacksonville, Florida, continued operating but on alert status because its primary communication line went down. A contractor was working on repairing the severed fiber line Friday afternoon. Authorities didn't specify what caused the severed line or where it happened.",
      "The FAA said the outage was momentary, but when air traffic controllers in a different facility in Philadelphia lost radar twice this spring it took 90 seconds for their systems to reboot after the system went down. In that case, the backup system didn't work immediately. Those outages led to major disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey because five controllers went on trauma leave afterward, and that facility in Philadelphia directs planes in and out of the airport.",
      "Hundreds of flights had to be canceled in Newark because the remaining controllers couldn't safely handle every flight on the schedule. Operations at the airport have since improved significantly",
      "An FAA spokesperson said there was \u201cno loss of critical air traffic service\u201d in Jacksonville because the backup system kicked in. That center is responsible for planes flying across roughly 160,000 square miles (414,000 square kilometers) of airspace across most of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.",
      "The problems in Newark were blamed on the failure of aging copper wires that much of the nation's air traffic control system still relies on. Transportation officials said the Newark problems demonstrated the need for a multimillion-dollar overhaul of the system that they are lobbying Congress to approve.",

      "Some migrants have been arrested at the court by federal immigration officers. The Rev. Scott Santarosa, a Jesuit priest who was lead organizer of the group, said the purpose of the visitation \u201cis more than anything just to provide some sense of presence.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are longing for people of faith to walk with vulnerable migrants,\u201d added Santarosa, the pastor of San Diego\u2019s Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. \u201cOur goal is not trying to prevent arrests \u2014 but we can witness it.\u201d",
      "The visit was preceded by a Mass at San Diego\u2019s Catholic Cathedral with bishops and other clergy \u2014 including Bishop Michael Pham, the top-ranking official in the group and one of the first bishops to be appointed by Pope Leo XIV after his election as pontiff \u2014 offering prayers for refugees and migrants on World Refugee Day.

    "story": [
      "A Missouri judge has ordered an insurance company to pay nearly $44 million in a lawsuit involving a man whose conviction for killing a newspaper sports editor was overturned",
      "A man won $11 million in a lawsuit against police after his conviction for killing a Missouri newspaper's sports editor was overturned, but the city's former insurer resisted paying most of it for almost three years. A Missouri judge this week ordered the company to pay nearly $44 million.",
      "Most of the money would go to Ryan Ferguson, whose legal battle with Minnesota-based St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. in Missouri's courts started in 2017, about six weeks after he won a federal lawsuit against six Columbia police officers. Ferguson was convicted in 2004 of killing Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt but was released from prison in 2013 after a state appeals court panel concluded that he hadn't received a fair trial. Ferguson maintained his innocence.",
      "The city insurer paid Ferguson $2.7 million almost immediately after he won his federal lawsuit, and his attorneys expected St. Paul to pay $8 million under its coverage for the officers from 2006 to 2011. But the company argued that it wasn't on the hook because the actions leading to Ferguson's arrest and imprisonment occurred before its coverage began.",
      "While Ferguson sought to collect, the officers argued that St. Paul was acting in bad faith, shifting the burden to them as individuals and forcing them to face bankruptcy. Ferguson's lawyers took up those claims, and Missouri courts concluded that St. Paul was obligated to pay $5.3 million for the time Ferguson was in prison while it covered the officers. It paid in 2020.",
      "But the payment didn't end the dispute, and in November, a jury concluded that St. Paul had acted in bad faith and engaged in a \u201cvexatious refusal\u201d to pay. Cole County Circuit Judge S. Cotton Walker upheld that finding in his order Monday as he calculated how much money the company would pay \u2014 mostly as punishment \u2014 under a Missouri law capping such punitive damages.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to send a message to insurance companies that if there's coverage, they need to pay,\u201d said Kathleen Zellner, whose firm represents Ferguson.",
      "She added: \u201cYou can\u2019t just pull the rug out from under people when they've paid the premiums.\u201d",
      "The company can appeal the decision. An attorney representing St. Paul did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.",
      "Under an agreement between Ferguson and the six officers, they stand to split about $5 million of the $44 million.",
      "The award of nearly $44 million includes $3.2 million to compensate Ferguson and the officers, another $24.2 million in punitive damages, $535,000 million for the \u201cvexatious refusal\u201d allegation and interest on all of the damages totaling about $16 million.",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents.

      "North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has vetoed his first bills",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed his first bills on Friday, blocking for now Republican legislation that would let adults carry concealed handguns without a permit and make state agencies and local sheriffs more active in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "Stein, who took office in January, issued his formal objections to three measures backed by the GOP-controlled General Assembly presented to him last week. The former attorney general also had the option to sign any of them into law, or let them become law if he hadn't acted on the legislation soon.",
      "The vetoed measures now return to the legislature, where Republicans are one House seat shy of holding a veto-proof majority. Its leaders will decide whether to attempt overrides as early as next week.",
      "Voting so far followed party lines for one of the immigration measures, which in part would direct heads of several state law enforcement agencies, like the State Highway Patrol and State Bureau of Investigation, to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But one House Democrat ended up voting for the other immigration bill that Stein vetoed. It toughens a 2024 law that required sheriffs to help federal agents seeking criminal defendants.",
      "GOP prospects for enacting the permitless concealed gun measure, a longtime aspiration for gun-rights advocates, appear dimmer, because two House Republicans voted against the bill and 10 others were absent.",
      "In one veto message, Stein said the gun legislation, which would allow eligible people at least 18 years old to carry a concealed handgun, \"makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership.\" Democratic lawmakers argued the same during legislative debate.",
      "Current law requires a concealed weapons holder to be at least 21 to obtain a permit. The person must submit an application to the local sheriff, pass a firearms safety training course and cannot \u201csuffer from a physical or mental infirmity that prevents the safe handling of a handgun\" to obtain the permit. No safety training would be required if getting a permit is no longer necessary.",
      "\u201cAuthorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous,\u201d Stein wrote.",
      "Gun-control groups praised the veto.",
      "Conservative advocates for the bill say removing the permit requirement would strengthen the safety of law-abiding citizens.",
      "\u201cLaw-abiding North Carolinians shouldn\u2019t have to jump through hoops to effectively exercise their Second Amendment rights,\" Senate leader Phil Berger said in a press release criticizing the veto and planning for an override vote in his chamber.",
      "Permitless carry is already lawful in 29 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. North Carolina would also be one of the last states in the Southeast to implement that legislation.",
      "One vetoed immigration bill would require four state law enforcement agencies to officially participate in the 287(g) program, which trains officers to interrogate defendants and determine their immigration status. An executive order by President Donald Trump urged his administration to maximize the use of 287(g) agreements.",
      "Stein wrote Friday the bill takes officers away from existing state duties at a time when law enforcement is already stretched thin. The measure also would direct state agencies to ensure noncitizens don\u2019t access certain state-funded benefits. But Stein said that people without lawful immigration status already can't receive them.",
      "The other vetoed bill attempts to expand a 2024 law \u2014 enacted over then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto \u2014 that directed jails to hold temporarily certain defendants whom ICE believe are in the country illegally, allowing time for immigration agents to pick them up.",
      "The vetoed bill would expand the list of crimes that a defendant is charged with that would require the jail administrator to attempt to determine the defendant\u2019s legal status. A jail also would have to tell ICE promptly that it is holding someone and essentially extends the time agents have to pick up the person.",
      "Stein said Friday while he supports sheriffs contacting federal immigration agents about defendants charged with dangerous crimes that they are holding, the law is unconstitutional because it directs sheriffs to keep defendants behind bars 48 hours beyond when they otherwise could be released for a suspected immigration violation.",
      "With the veto of this bill, House Speaker Destin Hall said, Stein sided with the \u201cmost radical elements of his party\u2019s base over the safety and security of North Carolinians.\u201d",
      "Latino advocates and other bill opponents had urged Stein to veto both immigration measures. They say the legislation would cause Hispanic residents to feel intimidated and fear law enforcement.",
      "Stein's vetoes help \u201censure North Carolina remains a safe state for everyone, including immigrants, who deserve equal treatment under the law,\" the group El Pueblo said in a news release.",

      "The husband of a Colorado woman whose remains were found after more than three years of searching has been rearrested on suspicion of first-degree murder",
      "DENVER -- The husband of Colorado woman Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were discovered over three years after she was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, was arrested again Friday on a first-degree murder charge, authorities said.",
      "Barry Morphew was arrested Friday in Arizona after a Colorado grand jury returned an indictment Wednesday, three years after the initial case was dropped because of prosecutorial issues with evidence.",
      "His bond was set at $3 million, cash only, according to court documents. The 12th District Attorney\u2019s office said in a statement that it is seeking to bring him back to Colorado.",
      "District Attorney Anne Kelly declined to elaborate beyond the indictment at a news conference, saying only that her office never gave up on getting justice for Suzanne Morphew.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to move forward in this case,\" Kelly said.",
      "A 2024 autopsy report said Suzanne Morphew died of \u201cunspecified means\u201d but ruled it a homicide. While there was no indication of trauma in her remains, a drug cocktail used to tranquilize wildlife was found in one of her bones, the report said.",
      "A tranquilizer gun and accessories were found in the Morphews\u2019 home, according to investigators.",
      "Barry Morphew has maintained his innocence since his wife disappeared, and his attorney David Beller blasted the new indictment.",
      "\u201cYet again, the government allows their predetermined conclusion to lead their search for evidence,\u201d Beller said in a statement. \u201cBarry maintains his innocence. The case has not changed, and the outcome will not either.\u201d",
      "Morphew was first charged with murder in May 2021, but prosecutors dropped that case the following year just as Morphew was about to stand trial.",
      "A judge barred prosecutors from calling key witnesses for repeatedly failing to follow rules for turning over evidence in Morphew\u2019s favor. That included DNA from an unknown male that was found in Suzanne Morphew\u2019s SUV. At the time, prosecutors said they wanted more time to find her body.",
      "The judge agreed to drop the case against Morphew but allowed prosecutors the option of filing charges against him later.",
      "Barry Morphew filed a $15 million lawsuit against county officials, accusing them of violating his constitutional rights. His lawyers also filed a complaint asking that the prosecutors be disciplined for allegedly intentionally withholding evidence.",
      "Iris Eytan, who was Morphew\u2019s attorney in 2021 but no longer represents him, said prosecutors \u201cfumbled\u201d the case.",
      "\u201cNot only is he is a loving father, but he was a loving husband,\u201d Eytan told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The previous district attorney who oversaw Morphew's prosecution, Linda Stanley, was ordered disbarred partially because of her mismanagement of the case. Stanley, then-prosecutor in the 11th District where the Morphews lived, made inappropriate comments about the case to the media, a state regulatory panel concluded.",
      "The mystery surrounding Suzanne Morphew began when the 49-year-old mother of two daughters, who lived near the small town of Salida, was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's mountain bike and helmet were found in separate spots not far from her home, but investigators suspected the bike had been purposefully thrown down into a ravine because there was no indications of a crash. A week after she went missing, Barry Morphew posted a video on Facebook pleading for her safe return.",
      "\u201cNo questions asked, however much they want, I will do whatever it takes to get you back,\u201d he said.",
      "When he was initially charged, the arrest affidavit laying out investigators\u2019 case against Barry Morphew said his wife insisted on leaving him. He later changed his statements as evidence developed.",
      "Morphew, an avid hunter, did not initially tell investigators that he went out of his way as he left for work on Mother\u2019s Day, driving toward the place where his wife\u2019s bicycle helmet was eventually found. Later, he said he went that way because he had seen an elk cross the road, according to the initial arrest affidavit.",
      "Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents stumbled upon Suzanne Morphew's skeletal remains in September 2023 in a shallow grave during an unrelated search near the small southern Colorado town of Moffat, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of the Morphews' home.",
      "Most of Suzanne Morphew\u2019s bones were recovered, and many were \u201csignificantly bleached,\u201d according to the affidavit.",
      "Investigators removed a port through which Morphew could receive medicine to treat follicular lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and found clothing similar to bicyclist clothes she was known to wear. Based on the status of the remains and clothing, a forensic anthropologist theorized that the body decomposed elsewhere, the affidavit says.",
      "Toxicology testing revealed all three drugs in a sedative used for wildlife called \u201cBAM\u201d were in the bones. The presence of a metabolite for one of the drugs, butorphanol, suggested the remains would not have been contaminated with BAM after death, the affidavit says.",
      "The coroner\u2019s office determined the cause of death was \u201chomicide by unspecified means\u201d through intoxication of the three drugs, butorphanol, azaperone and medetomidine.",
      "Barry Morphew obtained and filled several prescriptions for BAM while living in Indiana, shortly before the Morphews moved to Colorado in 2018. Barry Morphew was a deer farmer in Indiana and allegedly told investigators he used BAM to tranquilize deer in Indiana and Colorado, according to the indictment.",
      "In the area surrounding their home in Colorado, no private citizens or businesses, only Colorado Parks and Wildlife and National Park Service officials, had obtained BAM between 2017 and 2020, records show. No government officials reported missing BAM supplies.",
      "\u201cUltimately, the prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew,\u201d the indictment concluded.",

      "Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would say only that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation.",
      "The U.S. government in 2020 said that it had concluded that Levinson had died while in the custody of Iran. The family at the time said that it did not know when or if Levinson's body would be returned for burial but vowed that those responsible for his death would ultimately face justice.",
      "\"We want to make sure that our dad is not forgotten,\u201d Daniel Levinson, one of Levinson's sons, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The younger Levinson said that as President Donald Trump signals an interest in diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program that could avert direct U.S. military involvement in Iran's war with Israel, now is the time for Washington to use its \u201cleverage to hold them responsible.\u201d",
      "The family, he said, still has no answers but believes the Iranian government does.",

      "On Thursday, an account on the social media platform X created to draw attention to Levinson's case posted a message that said: \u201cOur dad, Bob Levinson, was left behind too many times. This may be the last chance to get answers. Any deal with Iran must finally bring him home to rest on US soil.\u201d",
      "Among the people who reposted the message was FBI Director Kash Patel.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state\u2019s public school classrooms is unconstitutional.",
      "The ruling Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students \u2014 especially those who are not Christian.",
      "The mandate has been touted by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "\u201cThis is a resounding victory for the separation of church and state and public education,\u201d said Heather L. Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWith today\u2019s ruling, the Fifth Circuit has held Louisiana accountable to a core constitutional promise: Public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith.\u201d",

      "The panel of judges reviewing the case was unusually liberal for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents.",
      "The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.",
      "The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",

      "In the meantime, the judge urged the parties to discuss a possible settlement over the weekend. Reyes said it would be \u201cexceedingly rational\u201d for both sides \u201cto get this behind you\u201d and avoid the time and expense of an appeal.",
      "Erin Smith claimed Walls-Kaufman gave her husband a concussion as they scuffled inside the Capitol. Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon.",
      "His widow claims Walls-Kaufman struck her 35-year-old husband in the head with his own police baton inside the Capitol, causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide. Smith had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot, but his mood and behavior changed after suffering a concussion, according to his wife and parents.",
      "Walls-Kaufman, who lived near the Capitol, denies assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.",
      "Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.",
      "Trump's sweeping act of clemency didn\u2019t erase Smith\u2019s lawsuit against Walls-Kaufman.",
      "Erin Smith, the trial\u2019s first witness, recalled packing a lunch for her husband and kissing him as he headed off to work on Jan. 15, 2021, for the first time after the riot.",
      "\u201cI told him I loved him, said I would see him when he got home,\u201d she testified.",
      "Within hours, police officers knocked on her door and informed her that her husband was dead. She was stunned to learn that he shot himself with his service weapon in his own car.",
      "\u201cIt was the most traumatic words I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "Walls-Kaufman\u2019s attorney, Hughie Hunt, urged jurors to \u201cseparate emotion\u201d and concentrate on the facts of the case.",
      "\u201cThis is tragic, but that doesn\u2019t place anything at the foot of my client,\u201d Hunt said during the trial\u2019s opening statements.",
      "Smith\u2019s body camera captured video of his scuffle with Walls-Kaufman. In his testimony, Walls-Kaufman said he was overcome by \u201csensory overload\u201d and \u201cmass confusion\u201d as police tried to usher the crowd out of the Capitol.",
      "\u201cI couldn't tell who was pushing who or from what direction,\u201d he said.",
      "The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. Hunt said there is no evidence that his client intentionally struck Smith.",
      "\u201cThe claim rests entirely on ambiguous video footage subject to interpretation and lacks corroborating eyewitness testimony,\u201d Hunt wrote in a court filing in the case.",
      "More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.",
      "In 2022, The District of Columbia Police and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line-of-duty and the injury was the \u201csole and direct cause of his death,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",

The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",
      "The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by TMZ, says that Perry first noticed Dixon in 2019 when Dixon was part of the event staff at a Perry party, and later offered an audition.",
      "Dixon would first appear in a small role on the Perry series \"Ruthless\" before getting the bigger role on the political drama \"The Oval.\"",

      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",

      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",
      "\"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "Prison staff gave R. Kelly \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him,\" his lawyer alleged in a federal court filing.",
    "story": [
      "R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after prison staff gave him \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him\" and was later forcibly removed from a hospital against medical advice, his lawyer alleged in a statement to CBS News and a federal court filing.",
      "The disgraced singer's lawyer, Beau Brindley, is requesting that a judge move him to home detention from the North Carolina prison where he is serving his sentences.",
      "\"Mr. Kelly's life is in danger and the threat comes from Bureau of Prisons officers whose duty is to protect him,\" Brindley wrote in a court motion filed Monday.",
      "He alleges the federal Bureau of Prisons is \"seeking to kill\" Kelly \"to cover up crimes committed in the investigation of his case.\"",
      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News show Kelly's legal team discuss the emergency release request with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien in back-and-forth filings this week. \"Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will,\" Julien said in a response filed Monday. \"Undeterred, Kelly now asks this Court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy.\"",
      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",

His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has\u00a0issued new guidance\u00a0for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge struck down sweeping Trump administration orders that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health research grants because they were linked to topics like diversity, gender identity and vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",
      "Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts capped a trial Monday for multiple lawsuits that were filed against the Trump administration: one by a coalition of public health groups and another by several Democratic state attorneys general.",

      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",
      "Another federal judge in Massachusetts earlier this year blocked the NIH from implementing a policy change that would have cut funding for research overhead costs, which is now being appealed by the Trump administration.",

    "summary": "Dr. Fiona Havers' resignation follows RFK Jr.'s orders to change the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "This Sunday, June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",

    "summary": "Social Security is dipping into its trust fund to pay current retirees, with spending outpacing its revenue from payroll taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a cut of between 19% to 23% to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

      "Suppliers of materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum, have already hiked prices for builders. Sixty percent of homebuilders say suppliers have either already raised prices or intend to, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo's April 2025 Housing Market Index. They attribute the price hikes to the Trump administration's sweeping levies on the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "Extra costs for materials can add up quickly, leading to a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project, according to the NAHB.",
      "Pre-ordering materials, before prices rise, is one way to save on roofing supplies such as shingles, according to Connecticut-based builder David Perotti, founder of Fine Home Contracting. He told CBS News that he saved a \"few thousand dollars\" on behalf of a client by ordering the roofing shingles early.",
      "Most materials that are used to build homes in the U.S. are imported, Perotti explained. For example, one-quarter of the country's available lumber supply comes from Canada, and could be subject to a 15% levy.",
      "Steel and aluminum are integral to building roofs, homes' plumbing systems, electrical equipment and HVAC systems.",
      "Tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum took effect earlier this month\u00a0and can apply to everything from coil roofing nails to metal flashing used to prevent leaks.",
      "Perotti's advice to homeowners looking for a refresh is to press pause on purchasing new appliances, and opt for a fresh paint job, which can go a long way toward making a home look new again.",
      "\"If you were to do one project, painting is usually really nice to freshen things up,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Perotti is also urging his clients to budget up to an additional 30% for extra, tariff-related costs on materials, particularly those that can go into remodeling bathrooms.",
      "Another tip is to work with materials suppliers to lock in prices when possible, even before materials become available. As far as repairs go, Perotti's advice is to prioritize fixing exterior damage, which can quickly lead to a home's degradation and cause more problems.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:44:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will maintain the benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, marking a continuation of its \"wait-and-see\" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.",
      "The central bank also expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, but it still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as it projected in March.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference to discuss the rate decision.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The rate has remained at that level since President Trump took office in January. The last time the Fed cut rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "When determining rate cuts, the Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and maintain a healthy job market. In its announcement\u00a0Wednesday, the central bank mentioned solid labor market conditions and an economy that continues to grow at a \"solid pace\" although it also signaled caution.",
      "\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,\" the Fed wrote in its announcement.",
      "At the Wednesday press conference, Powell underscored the relative strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions including the 4.2% unemployment rate, a low inflation rate and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. But he added that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth in the economy this year.",
      "In its latest\u00a0quarterly projections\u00a0for the economy and interest rates, the Fed said it expects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will pick up to 3% by year end. The central bank also expects unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%, up from the current 4.2%.",
      "\"The thing that every outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4% in May, still above the Fed's target rate of 2%. There has been speculation that Mr. Trump's tariffs could drive up inflation, but so far it has largely remained in check.",
      "Powell said that he expect the Fed will learn a \"great deal more\" on tariffs over the summer and that the developments will inform their thinking moving forward. In the meantime, the Fed Chair said the central bank is well positioned to hold off on rate cuts. \"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" he said.",
      "More tariff changes are expected in the coming months. President Trump's 90-day-pause on reciprocal tariffs ends July 9.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "Fed officials said they predict two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, in keeping with what they projected in March, but did not specify when future cuts might happen.",
      "\"What we're waiting for to reduce rates is to understand what will happen with the tariff inflation,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Others, meanwhile, are betting a rate reduction will come in September. Economists give a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate at its September 17 meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "But analysts also remain cautious in their predictions. \"If the June and July inflation measures remain tepid \u2014 and especially if the labor market starts to show signs of weakness \u2014 that could have investors wondering if the Fed may consider a cut at its July 29-30 meeting,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What does this mean for your money?",
      "The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher benchmark rate can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers because it helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "When the benchmark rate is lowered, loan rates tend to follow, making it less expensive to borrow money.",
      "With the Fed keeping rates steady, it's unlikely that borrowers will see near-term relief on their lending costs.",
      "\"This is music to the ears of savers, like retirees, that are earning good income on their hard-earned savings,\" said Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email. \"But it underscores the urgency for borrowers to aggressively pay down high-cost credit card debt and offers little hope of a significant drop in interest rates any time soon.\"",
      "What has President Trump said about interest rates?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to slash rates, including on Wednesday morning before the Fed announced its decision. During remarks to the press, Mr. Trump called out Powell, saying he's \"done a poor job.\"",
      "\"We had the highest inflation we ever had and then it came down when I got elected,\" he said. \"Now we have a man who refuses to lower the Fed rate.\"",

      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",

      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",

      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",

      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",

      "When is the FOMC meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",

      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have finalized their partnership and revealed new details about the deal.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced Wednesday that they have finalized their long-awaited partnership.",
      "Under the announced agreement, U.S. Steel will retain its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh. The steel will continue to be \"mined, melted and made\" in the United States, the companies said. The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",
      "A deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel was first proposed in late 2023. Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",
      "On June 13, Mr. Trump cleared the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel. The companies say they have \"now completed the transaction as contemplated by their merger agreement.\"",
      "The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Under that agreement, Nippon Steel has agreed to make about $11 billion in new investments in U.S. Steel by 2028, including an initial investment in a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, they said. The agreement also requires that the majority of members of U.S. Steel's board of directors and key management personnel, including its CEO, be U.S. citizens, and says that U.S. Steel will remain a U.S.-incorporated entity.",
      "Takashi Mori, Nippon Steel's representative director and vice chairman, will serve as chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, according to the news release.",
      "The United Steelworkers union issued a statement accusing the companies of \"down-playing concerns\" about what the deal would mean over the long-term.",
      "\"As the sale concludes, it seems likely that attention will dissipate,\" USW president\u00a0David McCall\u00a0said. \"However, our union will remain. We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments. And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\" The union's current contract agreement expires in September 2026.",
      "The deal announced Wednesday requires that U.S. Steel maintain capacity to produce and supply steel from U.S. production locations to meet market demand in the country, and says that Nippon Steel will not \"prevent, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with U.S. Steel's ability to pursue trade action under U.S. law.\"",
      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",
      "The deal comes as Mr. Trump recently doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports.",
      "\"This is a momentous day for our country, our communities, and the American steel industry,\" said U.S. Steel CEO Dave Burritt in a news release announcing the partnership details. \"Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American workers secured the best possible deal. U. S. Steel will remain rooted in the United States and continue to call Pittsburgh home. Through our partnership with Nippon Steel, we are poised to grow better and bigger, with transformative investment, cutting-edge technology, and the creation of good-paying jobs across the United States.\"",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing bases in more than a dozen countries, including Japan, India and Mexico.",
      "U.S. Steel has been headquartered in Pittsburgh since 1901, and has operations elsewhere in the U.S. and in Central Europe.",

    "summary": "More states, territories and Washington, D.C., have signed on to a settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous\u00a0Purdue bankruptcy settlement\u00a0was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",

    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil exited an ICE facility late Friday, after months in detention.",
    "story": [
      "Columbia University activist\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil\u00a0exited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana on Friday night, after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings play out.",
      "Khalil \u2014 who spent months in custody as the Trump administration attempted to deport him due to \"foreign policy\" concerns \u2014 addressed reporters after leaving the facility, ahead of his return to New York.",
      "\"Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this,\" Khalil said.",
      "During a hearing hours earlier before U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil's attorneys asked him to free Khalil from detention or transfer him to New Jersey. The New Jersey judge agreed, determining that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been \"highly unusual.\"",
      "Farbiarz denied the government's request to stay his decision. In his written order, Farbiarz said \"the Petitioner shall be released from immigration custody today.\" His bail conditions restrict his travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana, where he must attend all of his immigration proceedings.",
      "Khalil is a green card holder who was detained by immigration agents in March. His wife Noor Abdalla was 8 months pregnant with their first child when he was first taken into custody, and gave birth\u00a0to a baby boy in April. Immigration officials denied Khalil's request for temporary release to attend the birth, and a judge later allowed him to see his son during a brief visit last month.",
      "\"Now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock,\" Khalil said Friday, when asked about his plans after returning home.",
      "\"My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that,\" Abdalla said in a March interview with \u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "In a statement released by the ACLU, which represents Khalil, Abdalla said \"we can finally breathe a sigh of relief and know that Mahmoud is on his way home to me and Deen, who never should have been separated from his father.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said prior to his release the administration would appeal.",
      "\"[T]here is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey \u2014 who lacks jurisdiction \u2014 to order Khalil's release from a detention facility in Louisiana,\" Jackson said. \"We expect to be vindicated on appeal, and look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the order was \"yet another example of how out of control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property,\" McLaughlin said. \"An immigration judge has already vindicated this position. We expect a higher court to do the same.\"",
      "Khalil was initially detained under a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Farbiarz ruled last week that Khalil cannot be detained simply based on that determination, but the Department of Homeland Security has kept Khalil detained based on allegations that he omitted details from his green card application. Farbiarz said the new justification wasn't enough to continue his detention.",
      "\"It's overwhelmingly unlikely that a lawful permanent resident would be held on the remaining charge here,\" Farbiarz said, adding that \"there is an effort to use the immigration charge here to punish the petitioner\" for his anti-Israel speech. As a graduate student at Columbia, Khalil was among the leaders of students who protested Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. Khalil has since graduated.",
      "\"What all of that evidence adds up to is a lack of violence, a lack of property destruction, a lack of anything that would be characterized as inciting violence,\" Farbiarz added, saying that he has given government attorneys ample opportunity to address the lack of evidence and that they have provided none.",
      "During the hearing, Khalil's attorneys said that a Louisiana immigration judge denied a bond hearing for Khalil and has denied asylum, in addition to finding him removable on Rubio's declaration, conflicting with Farbiarz's order last week.",
      "\"There has been a thick record developed here,\" Farbiarz said, adding that he will not order electronic monitoring of Khalil.",
      "Farbiarz   ruled that Khalil's travel will be limited between New York and Michigan to visit family, along with New Jersey and Louisiana for court hearings and attorney visits only.",
      "Farbiarz   ordered Khalil surrender his passport, but said he could have his green card returned to him in order to facilitate his travel to New York. He is not allowed to travel internationally.",
      "Khalil was also ordered to update his current address with DHS within 48 hours of his release.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 22:51:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Harvard can continue hosting foreign students, a federal judge ruled Friday.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students \u2014 but President Trump said\u00a0Friday he could strike a \"deal\" to resolve his battles with the Ivy League school within days.",
      "The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database that keeps track of student visa applications. The Boston-based judge had previously blocked the policy through a temporary restraining order.",
      "Minutes later on Friday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that his administration has been \"working closely with Harvard, and it is very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" the president wrote. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be \"mindbogglingly\" HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the settlement talks. CBS News has reached out to Harvard and the White House for comment on the discussions.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security told Harvard in May it was revoking its student visa system certification, telling the school \"it is a privilege to enroll foreign students\" \u2014 and the school \"lost this privilege\" by allegedly failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard quickly sued, arguing the school was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda, and Burroughs sided with Harvard.",
      "Mr. Trump issued a separate order earlier this month barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard. Burroughs blocked that move two weeks ago, though her ruling Friday did not address Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In reaction to the judge's Friday ruling, a Harvard spokesperson said: \"The Court order allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students and scholars while the case moves forward. Harvard will continue to defend its rights\u2014and the rights of its students and scholars.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Burroughs' ruling is \"in direct conflict with the President's constitutionally vested powers under Article II and those granted by federal law.\"",
      "\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The battle over international students could have grave consequences for Harvard, where about one in four students hail from outside the United States. Mr. Trump suggested last month that Harvard should cap its foreign student enrollment at 15%, and share more information with the government so it can determine whether prospective students are \"troublemakers.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also ordered \"additional vetting\" for anybody who wants to travel to Harvard from abroad, including students as well as staff, faculty, guest speakers and tourists, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "It's part of a wider back-and-forth between Harvard and the Trump administration. In April, the administration pushed the school to make a range of policy changes in order to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the government, including external audits of some academic departments and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. When the school refused, the government said it would cut off billions of dollars in grants to Harvard.",
      "Other universities have faced similar pressure, including demands for policy changes \u2014 often zeroing in on the schools' handling of pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 and grant freezes.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department announced guidelines for vetting student visa applicants' social media accounts, telling staff to look for signs of \"hostility\" toward the U.S.",
      "And some international students who are already in the U.S. have faced scrutiny. Authorities have detained several students linked to pro-Palestinian activism, including Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia and Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts. Mahdawi and Ozturk have since been released, and a judge ordered Khalil's release Friday.",

His wife told investigators they were going to visit friends after her husband posted in a family group text \"they needed to get out of the house and people with guns may be showing up.\"",
      "The affidavit states Boelter's wife told the investigator they were \"preppers,\" meaning they \"prepare for major or catastrophic incidents.\" She says her husband gave her a \"bailout plan,\" including a directive to go to her mother's home in southwestern Wisconsin.",
      "She also told investigators her husband \"has a business partner from Worthington\" who lives in the state of Washington. She allegedly said the two were\u00a0 \"partners \u2026 in Red Lion, a security company and fishing outfit in Congo, Africa,\" the affidavit states.",
      "Empty rifle cases found in storage locker, search warrant says",

      "WCCO's Sky 4 helicopter spotted law enforcement gathered at a pond on the golf course, with divers searching the waters.",
      "The evidence scattered around Hortman's neighborhood",
      "Police encountered Boelter at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday outside the Hortmans' home, where they exchanged gunfire, the federal criminal complaint notes. After allegedly killing the Hortmans, he fled the area on foot.",
      "Officers pursued, finding a ballistic vest, handgun magazines, a flashlight, face mask and Beretta 92 9mm pistol along the way.",
      "The federal complaint notes investigators identified Boelter from a storage unit bill found at the scene that listed his name; license plates found that were removed from the vehicle left outside the Hortmans' home, registered to Boelter and his wife; and pieces of the Beretta handgun \u2014 bought by Boelter in 2020 \u2014 and abandoned ammo magazine found in the Hortmans' neighborhood. Investigators say the ammo matched bullet casings found around their home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 During a visit with federal law enforcement in Los Angeles on Friday, Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration still believes a military deployment to the city is necessary.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the Los Angeles area since protests broke out in the nation's second-largest city over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. He gave brief remarks after touring a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a federal mobile command center, and meeting with leadership and Marines on the ground.",
      "President Trump federalized\u00a0thousands of troops\u00a0from the California National Guard in response to the Los Angeles-area protests and ordered about 700 Marines to be deployed to protect federal property. The president\u00a0has directed\u00a0federal immigration authorities to prioritize deporting individuals from Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, and a series of ICE operations in L.A.\u00a0sparked the protests\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The deployments drew a lawsuit from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who argued the presence of military forces could inflame the situation. Late Thursday, a federal appeals court\u00a0allowed\u00a0the president to keep control of the National Guard troops he deployed to the Los Angeles region, halting a ruling from a lower court judge who said the president acted illegally when he activated the troops over objections from Newsom. The protests have waned, but the troops remain.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Friday, Vance said the situation has \"gotten a lot better,\" but the Marines and National Guard forces are still \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" arguing the protests could \"flare back up.\"",
      "The vice president also alleged that Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had \"egged on\" violence during the protests. The administration has accused state and local officials of failing to protect federal immigration agents from threats and interference from protesters. Local authorities have pushed back, arguing federal authorities are responsible for the chaos.",
      "\"I would absolutely say that Gavin Newsom is endangering law enforcement,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance suggested the administration is willing to use the Guard in other places, but that it hopes not to.",
      "\"If you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,\" the vice president said.",
      "In a news conference Friday night, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said Vance was \"spewing lies and utter nonsense in an attempt to promote division and conflict in our city.\"",
      "Vance calls Sen. Alex Padilla \"Jos\u00e9 Padilla\"",
      "At one point, Vance referred to Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, as \"Jos\u00e9 Padilla.\"",
      "\"I was hoping Jos\u00e9 Padilla would be here to ask a question, but unfortunately, I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't the theater,\" Vance said.",
      "The senator made news last week after he was\u00a0forcibly removed\u00a0from a press conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, an incident Vance called \"pure political theater.\"",
      "\"Mr. vice president, how dare you disrespect our senator,\" Bass said in her news conference. \"You don't know his name? But yet you served with him before you were vice president, and you continue to serve with him today.

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "summary": "There's a narrow window to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end before President Trump decides whether to involve the U.S. in the Israeli offensive.",
    "story": [
      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",
      "U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that there are confidential conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, and the potential environmental and health fallout for regional allies from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",
      "In the meantime, the president still has the option of choosing to use military force including the potential of using for the first time in history the MOP or massive ordnance penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb, to destroy the underground nuclear facilities at Fordo.",
      "In theory, Mr. Trump maintains the ability to launch a strike while he's out of town at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday and Saturday, sources said. A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003. But Iran has accumulated a quantity of enriched nuclear fuel that could potentially be matched with an advanced missile or a more rudimentary weapon in short order if the supreme leader ordered it. It remains an open question whether bombing Fordo would trigger Iran's leaders to sprint toward creating a bomb or end the program altogether.",

      "\"Well then, my intelligence community is wrong,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Who in the intelligence community said that?\"",
      "\"Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,\" the reporter answered.",

      "The president previously dismissed Gabbard's testimony earlier this week, on his way back from a G7 summit in Canada. A reporter noted that Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"I don't care what she said,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I think they were very close to having one.\"",

      "Vice President JD Vance\u00a0wrote on X on Tuesday that \"Tulsi's testimony was in March, and a lot has changed since then.\"",
      "The president has been briefed on the risks and the benefits of bombing\u00a0Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, multiple sources told CBS News this week.\u00a0His mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the president will make a decision on whether to join Israel's strikes within two weeks and allow the diplomatic path to play out.",
      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" the president said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing. The Iranian foreign minister met with a group of European diplomats in Geneva on Friday.",
      "Asked Friday if a strike could be possible before the two-week deadline is up, the president said: \"I'm giving them a period of time. We'll see what that period of time is. I'm giving them a period of time. But two weeks would be the maximum.\"",

      "The ruling on Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students \u2014 especially those who are not Christian.",
      "\"Parents and students challenge a statute requiring public schools to permanently display the Ten Commandments in every classroom in Louisiana,\" the court said in its ruling. \"The district court found the statute facially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined its enforcement. We AFFIRM.\"",
      "The mandate, which took effect Jan. 1, has been touted by Republicans, including President Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "The ruling from the largely conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.",
      "\"As noted, if H.B. 71 goes into effect, Students will be subjected to unwelcome displays of the Ten Commandments for the entirety of their public school education,\" the judges wrote. \"There is no opt-out option.\"",
      "Louisiana in June 2024 became the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law. The law required a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.",
      "The court's ruling backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she has been \"pretty clear\" about her concerns over potential cuts President Trump's so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" would make to Medicaid and food benefits for her constituents in Alaska.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Murkowski told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell that she hasn't given any absolute deal-breakers in the Senate legislation \u2014 but she's voiced her reservations about the Medicaid proposals.",
      "\"I have not given anybody in the administration an absolute, this is my red line, right?\" Because I think it's important that every step of the way, I communicate where my concerns are,\" Murkowski told O'Donnell in the interview airing this weekend.",
      "The reconciliation bill \u2014 or \"one big, beautiful bill,\" as Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have dubbed it \u2014 has passed the House, but remains up for debate in the Senate, where some Republicans are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House-passed version allows.",
      "Medicaid is the entitlement program that offers government-backed health care for both low-income Americans and those with disabilities, with the federal government and states splitting the costs. While the House version adds a new work requirement to Medicaid for childless adults, the Senate wants work requirements to expand to parents of older children. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to the poorest Americans, and some Senate Republicans are hoping to place more requirements on states.",
      "\"So I've been pretty clear that when it comes to Medicaid, those cuts that would harm Alaskan beneficiaries, that's not something that I can take home, right? We have some of the highest health care costs in the country. We have 40% of Alaska's kids that are on Medicaid. I want to try to do what we can to address certain aspects of our entitlement spending. We've got to do that. But doing it with the most vulnerable bearing the brunt of that is not the answer,\" she said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from North Dakota, wants the reconciliation bill to pass by the July 4 holiday, but that deadline is quickly approaching.",

      "After losing a Republican primary in 2010, Alaskan Senator Lisa Murkowski \u2013 bucking party orthodoxy \u2013 ran for re-election with a write-in campaign, and won. That victory, thanks to a diverse coalition of Alaskans, instructed her service as a senator in an increasingly partisan Washington, she writes in her new memoir, \"Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.\" (to be published June 24 by Forum Books).",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Lisa Murkowski on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 22!",
      "\"Far From Home\" by Lisa Murkowski",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "I want to offer hope. The traditional tools of American democracy do still function. I wrote this book to tell the story of one consensus-building senator\u2014grounded in her home, aware of who she serves, and honoring the process\u2014who produced results and won elections. The chapters ahead explain how this happened. I began as president of my sons'\u00a0 elementary school PTA. That satisfying community leadership encouraged me toward state elected office before I found myself suddenly catapulted to the national stage and\u00a0 challenged by overwhelming responsibilities. My story took a major, positive turn in 2010, after I lost a primary election and voters themselves convinced me that my service was still important, and why. A diverse coalition of Alaskans returned me to the Senate in a write-in campaign, with a mandate to vote my conscience and keep their practical needs foremost, not my party. With their confidence, I became a newly self-directed and more successful senator.",
      "Alaskans' voices still guide me every day. Independent Alaskans became the largest part of my electoral coalition, and they supported me in thinking for myself, even if they sometimes disagreed with the result. I took that to heart, and followed my own judgment on votes, many times contrary to party leadership. For example, as the Senate process of confirming presidential appointments degenerated, with party-line votes for or against nominees based purely on politics, I chose to prioritize qualifications rather than party. In one of my toughest stands, I was the only Republican to oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. I got heat for these choices, but I believed I was helping the system work as the founders intended. At times, my independence also yielded political benefits, although that had not been my goal. Senators began working for my vote, knowing they couldn't take it for granted. The White House realized nominees had to be qualified to gain my support.",
      "The system works if we use it. We don't need an overhaul with drastic reforms (although I will touch on election changes in Alaska that empowered the center and could help elsewhere). The more discouraging message is that being a pro-institution problem solver is hard, and not many of us remain in the Senate. We have passed a lot of good laws, because our swing votes controlled the balance of power, but our team of roughly a dozen senators spread across both parties has been shrinking. Intense pressure weighed on bipartisan lawmakers such as Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, and Mitt Romney. The parties\u00a0 demand conformity, and their loudest voices are also their most extreme and uncompromising. As holdouts for bipartisanship, those of us building consensus brought abuse on ourselves. Now all three of these smart, honorable, productive colleagues have retired from the Senate.",
      "The solution is to keep electing people who want to solve problems. We can do this only one senator\u2014and one voter\u2014at a time. The partisanship and division in our country has come with a loss of community and a weakening in many of the local organizations that connect us. We no longer spend enough time talking to people with different points of view. I'm an example of someone who started out in public service, in our highly diverse neighborhood in Anchorage, learning about families unlike my own while we worked together to improve our children's lives. We build up American democracy from that community level. It is up to each of us to get involved.",
      "And that brings me to one more reason for this book: We need stories so we can see the possibilities. We need to be able to imagine ourselves in our leaders' roles. Washington, D.C., should be visible from Newtok and from every community in our country. This is why I've chosen to be open about my feelings and my failures as well as my successes. I have no exceptional talent. One reason I legislate with partners is that others have great ideas I would never think of. I know how to bring people together and get things done, but I'm no better than anyone else.",
      "My hope is that when you learn my story, my struggles, and my fears, you will realize that you can do this, too. We need you. Only good people can get our government back on track. We need regular people who care about their communities and are willing to do the work, follow the rules, and think for themselves. We have plenty of ideologues and party-oriented political warriors in Congress. We need more Little League coaches and soccer moms. If I can do it, so can you. In fact, it's your responsibility.",

      "In a statement to CBS News on Friday, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said the \"Press 3 option,\" which is managed by a third party outside of the federal government, ran out of congressionally directed funding.",
      "\"Continued operation of Press 3 would have required SAMHSA to reallocate funds away from supporting the main 988 Lifeline thereby compromising the entire system,\" the statement said. \"SAMHSA made a critical decision that sustained the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has been briefed on both the risks and the benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "\"He believes there's not much choice,\" one source said. \"Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "The president approved attack plans on Iran on Tuesday night, but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country and formally join Israel's air campaign, a senior intelligence source and a Defense Department official told CBS News on Wednesday. Mr. Trump held off on deciding to strike in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, the sources said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will make a decision on whether to order a strike within the next two weeks.",
      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Mr. Trump was weighing a strike on Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. Israel has not conducted any known strikes on Fordo since it began bombing Iranian nuclear and military targets late last week.",
      "Trump's decision",
      "Mr. Trump is willing to get the U.S. involved if that's what it takes to knock out the site, sources said. As of Thursday, he was still reviewing his options and has not made a firm decision either way. He has discussed the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of the U.S. military infrastructure needed for a strike was in place or how much time it would take to move assets into position.",
      "One option Mr. Trump has considered is that Iran could disable Fordo on its own, if its leaders so choose, two of the sources said.",
      "David Lammy, the foreign secretary of the U.K., flew to Washington to meet Thursday with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, CBS News learned, with active diplomacy underway to find an off-ramp in the conflict and make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Iran. London maintains an embassy in Tehran, giving the U.K. visibility that the U.S. does not have in the Iranian capital.",
      "\"Now is the time to put a stop to the grave scenes in the Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one,\" Lammy said in a statement following his meetings with Trump officials.",
      "Mr. Trump is aware of the diplomatic effort being undertaken, with Lammy, the foreign ministers of Germany, France and the high representative of the European Union set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva on Friday.",
      "The conversation there may help ascertain whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S., not just the European nations, which is something Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Mr. Trump has viewed intelligence reports indicating the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, has said in closed-door settings that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing nuclear weapons, according to multiple sources.",
      "Ratcliffe has said that claiming Iran isn't close would be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard line don't want to score a touchdown, one U.S. official said.",
      "Congressional committees that have been briefed by senior CIA analysts have been told the intelligence community's view remains that no order to weaponize has been given by the supreme leader and that Iran has not restarted research on a delivery mechanism for a nuclear bomb.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that \"so far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "\"They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\" he told reporters. \"If there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it's based upon fact and not political influence.\"",
      "\"Things change, especially with war\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not made a final decision on whether to strike Iran.",
      "\"I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, because things change, especially with war,\" he said.",
      "\"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,\" he said earlier in the day, adding that he'd like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program.",
      "Iran \u2014 which has long insisted the program exists solely for peaceful purposes \u2014 said Wednesday it \"does NOT negotiate under duress,\" and said it would \"respond to any threat with a counter-threat.\"",
      "Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a Pentagon official briefed on the matter.",
      "Israel began striking Iran last Friday morning. The Trump administration has said publicly it is not participating in the offensive strikes, though CBS News previously reported the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.",
      "In recent days, Mr. Trump has not ruled out the idea of joining Israel's campaign, saying on Truth Social his \"patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "The president said Tuesday the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. On Sunday, CBS News reported Mr. Trump had opposed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.",
      "Next steps in possible negotiations",
      "Two diplomatic sources indicated to CBS News that Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, had offered to host potential direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran should Tehran choose that path. At this point, there are no direct US-Iran talks scheduled, though European allies are trying to help coordinate.",
      "On Thursday, the Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rubio had told him that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts. A French diplomat said that Rubio spoke by phone with his French counterpart, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, and conveyed that the U.S. was ready for \"direct contact with the Iranians at any time.\" Barrot and Rubio are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations in order to coordinate.",
      "Amidst the chaos inside Iran following the Israeli strikes and the killing of top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials, it is not clear just what Araghchi's marching orders will be when he arrives in Geneva, nor how functional the Iranian government itself is at this moment.",
      "Sources in the region indicated that connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete. The cyber attacks that have paralyzed the banking system itself underscore the internal disruption, and as of Thursday multiple diplomats acknowledged it all made it more difficult to arrange for in person talks with Araghchi   in the first place. Iranian state news announced Araghchi   is expected to transit on to Turkey on June 20.",
      "One diplomatic source indicated that the ongoing Israeli assault may also make the supreme leader fearful to communicate given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him.",
      "Mr. Trump has been frustrated in recent weeks that while Iran shows up to the negotiating table, its leaders have not shown a willingness to negotiate terms. A U.S. official familiar with the efforts told News CBS that Iran sat for two weeks on the most recent Witkoff proposal presented by the U.S. without directly declining or accepting its terms. Instead Iranian leadership issued press statements, but the negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement left the Trump administration in doubt over whether Iran was engaging in good faith negotiations, or simply running out the proverbial clock.",
      "Netanyahu has publicly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump, and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes but also did not explicitly tell Netanyahu to go forward. Diplomatic sources acknowledged to CBS News that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel, and uncertain over whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was all a ruse to justify the military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "A U.S. official insisted to CBS News Thursday evening that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine as was his aversion to getting the U.S. military drawn into a Middle East war, especially without a clear sense of what will come next should the Iranian regime collapse. U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that behind closed doors there are conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, as well as environmental and health impacts for allies in surrounding areas that could result from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",

    "summary": "In a victory for President Trump, about 4,000 National Guard troops can remain in Los Angeles for now.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The unanimous order from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a victory for the president and allows for the continued deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they have been protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents during enforcement operations.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked a law known as Title 10 to call the Guard into federal service earlier this month in response to demonstrations against immigration raids conducted across Los Angeles. Since then, a total of roughly 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have deployed to Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the use of troops in California's largest city and sued the president over his decision to federalize the California Guard. A federal judge, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, concluded last week that Mr. Trump's actions were illegal and exceeded the scope of his authority.",
      "The judge blocked the administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed the president to return control of the troops to Newsom. His decision applied only to Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard, and not the Marines.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed the decision and won a temporary stay of Breyer's order from the 9th Circuit. It held a hearing Tuesday to consider a Justice Department request to halt the judge's decision while the case proceeds.",
      "The 9th Circuit judges sided with Mr. Trump on Thursday. They wrote \"it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority\" to federalize the National Guard under Title 10, which allows the president to call the Guard into federal service whenever \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,\" or when the president is unable to \"execute the laws\" of the U.S.",
      "The panel of judges \u2014 made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee \u2014 rejected the Trump administration's argument that the courts don't have the power to review whether the president is allowed to call up the Guard. But they said judges need to be \"highly deferential\" to the president if he decides that troops need to be deployed, citing prior rulings.",
      "The court said administration officials \"have presented facts to allow us to conclude that the President had a colorable basis for invoking\" Title 10, noting instances of protesters in Los Angeles interfering with immigration agents.",
      "The 9th Circuit also said the Trump administration did not need to seek Newsom's permission to call up the Guard. The state has pointed to a provision of Title 10 that said orders to federalize the Guard should go \"through the governors\" \u2014 but the court said that \"does not give governors any veto power.\"",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump wrote late Thursday: \"BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President's core power to call in the National Guard! The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.\"",
      "In his own statement, Newsom expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying: \"The court rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court. The President is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.\"",
      "Trump alleges \"rebellion\" \u2014 but California calls Guard deployment \"extraordinary\"",
      "The Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump properly invoked the authorities laid out in Title 10 when he federalized National Guard troops in response to the protests in Los Angeles. In his June 7 memorandum deploying members of the National Guard, Mr. Trump said the protests constituted a \"form of rebellion\" against the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department further argued that courts had no role to play in reviewing the president's directive, as the law leaves decisions of whether to call forth the National Guard to the president's discretion. Courts, administration lawyers said, should not second-guess the commander-in-chief's military judgments.",
      "During arguments before the 9th Circuit, Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, warned that Breyer's order, if left intact, risked putting federal judges \"on a collision course with the commander in chief\" and would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "But California officials argued that the Trump administration should have considered more \"modest measures\" to quell the demonstrations in Los Angeles before taking the \"extraordinary step\" of deploying the National Guard.",
      "Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for the state, warned that the continued presence of troops on California streets would only escalate tensions and the risk of violence. Plus, he said Mr. Trump failed to adhere to the requirements of Title 10 by not consulting with Newsom before calling forth members of the California National Guard.",
      "In his memo, Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of the Guard. The secretary then issued memoranda to the adjutant general of the California National Guard to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "It had been 60 years since a president last sent in the National Guard without a request from a state's government, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed the guard to Alabama in 1965 to protect a voting rights march.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his memo that the protests in Los Angeles threatened the security of a federal immigration detention facility in the city, as well as other government property. The demonstrations broke out earlier this month in response to the immigration raids across Los Angeles, conducted as part of Mr. Trump's promise of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. Protests against the president's immigration crackdown have spread to other cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has continued to step up immigration enforcement and announced Sunday on social media that federal immigration authorities should \"do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest mass deportation program in history.\"",

      "He took part in the service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, one of the locations where an order\u00a0announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read on June 19, 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, according to the church. Biden called Galveston \"the city where freedom rang out 160 years ago.\"",
      "In 2021, Biden signed into law\u00a0a measure that made June 19, or Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Called the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the bill passed the House with overwhelming support and was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate. Juneteenth became the nation's first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.",
      "Biden spoke about his early history in politics and recounted his role in making Juneteenth a federal holiday, saying, \"the events of Juneteenth are of monumental importance to America's story.\"",
      "\"Still today, some say to me and you that this doesn't deserve to be a federal holiday. They don't want to remember...the moral stain of slavery,\" he said.",
      "Biden also chided what he referred to as \"ongoing efforts to erase history from our textbooks and our classrooms.\"",

      "\"What are we doing now? Reinstating those names,\" Biden said, referring to the Trump administration's push to restore\u00a0the military bases' old names.

I know this is a federal holiday. I want to thank all of you for showing up to work. We are certainly here. We're working 24/7 right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump honored Juneteenth during his first term, including in 2017, when he called it \"a historic day recognizing the end of slavery.\" He issued similar messages in 2018 and 2019, and in 2020, he said during an interview that he \"made Juneteenth very famous\" \u2014 referring to his decision not to hold a campaign rally in Oklahoma on the holiday.",

      "Rep. Eric Swalwell is no stranger to fighting legal battles. Swalwell, in his seventh term as a Democrat representing the Bay Area of California, served as an impeachment manager in President Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020. Swalwell is also the plaintiff in a four-year civil lawsuit seeking damages from Mr. Trump for the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But Swalwell, an attorney and former local prosecutor in Alameda County, is so concerned about legal peril during the second Trump term, he has taken out a liability insurance policy to protect himself. Swalwell confirmed he had done so in a text message to CBS News.",
      "In a social media post last month, Swalwell accused the Trump administration of targeting Democratic legislators like his colleague, New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting law enforcement officers at an immigration detention center.",
      "Swalwell \u2014 who has not been charged with a crime \u2014 wrote on X, \"A RED LINE has been crossed. Trump is prosecuting his political enemies in Congress. This is just the beginning. We must take whatever we've done before to show dissent and go one rung higher.\"",
      "Last week's handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a news conference and briefly cuffed by federal agents after publicly questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has raised criticisms that the Trump administration has broken norms \u2014 and escalated tensions \u2014 by allowing federal law enforcement to arrest or detain elected officials who dissent.",
      "The Padilla incident occurred weeks after the arrests of McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat, after a May 9 confrontation with federal agents outside the Delaney Hall immigration facility in Newark. Prosecutors dropped the case against Baraka, but McIver faces felony charges and the prospect of a multi-year prison sentence if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Prosecutors allege McIver struck agents with her arms during the incident. The Department of Homeland Security accused the elected officials of \"breaking into\" the detention center.",
      "McIver responded to her indictment in a statement that said, \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "In the latest incident, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democrat running for mayor, was detained by immigration agents Tuesday at a Manhattan courthouse.",
      "In a sequence of events captured on video, Lander was seen holding onto a man, whom he identified as Edgardo, following the man's immigration hearing. Video then showed masked immigration agents trying to take the man into custody, and then taking Lander into custody as he asked to see a warrant.",
      "Federal law enforcement officials said Lander was arrested \"for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\"",
      "He was released four hours later, with his wife and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul by his side. No charges were filed against him.",
      "The series of arrests began with the case of Hannah Dugan in April. Dugan, an elected Wisconsin circuit court judge, has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing federal agents, for allegedly rerouting a criminal defendant from her courtroom to avoid immigration agents. Dugan's July 21 trial date was delayed Wednesday, as a judge considers a motion from Dugan to dismiss the case.",
      "Raskin alleges \"strong-arm tactics\" to \"silence and intimidate\"",
      "The arrests, detentions and handcuffings are inflaming an already toxic political moment and supercharging complaints by Democrats that Mr. Trump is seeking to use law enforcement powers to subdue his opposition.",
      "\"Trump and his enforcers want to handcuff and jail members of the legislative branch who perform oversight,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Raskin told CBS News, \"These strong-arm tactics are meant to silence and intimidate people, but they only strengthen our conviction.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a White House spokeswoman said, \"Here's the real story: why do so many Democrat officials feel emboldened to brazenly break the law and then complain when they are held accountable?\"",
      "\"It's alarming Democrats think they can obstruct federal law enforcement, assault ICE agents, or physically push law enforcement officers while charging a cabinet secretary, without consequence \u2014 it's even more alarming that the media is encouraging and defending this lawless behavior,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "After his case was dismissed, Baraka filed a civil suit against the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, who not only filed the criminal case, but posted about Baraka's arrest on social media. The lawsuit accuses Habba of defamation and seeks damages for what it calls \"false arrest and malicious prosecution.\"",
      "The criminal cases are a burden to public officials, who must pay legal costs and expend time on court hearings. Defense attorneys for McIver noted she has juggled initial proceedings in her case in Newark with her duties in the U.S. Capitol, during a busy month in the House since the May 9 incident.",
      "In her filing to dismiss her obstruction case, Dugan argued the Justice Department was violating separation of powers and unlawfully exceeding its authority. \"The government's prosecution here reaches directly into a state courthouse, disrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge,\" she argued.",
      "The legal battles are separate from the political acrimony that has been fueled by the physical confrontations, including the handcuffing of Padilla last week \u2014 which the Department of Homeland Security claims happened after Padilla \"lunged toward\" Noem.",
      "In a tearful floor speech Tuesday, Padilla asked, \"How many Americans in the year 2025 see a vindictive president on a tour of retribution?\"",

      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",

      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous\u00a0Purdue bankruptcy settlement\u00a0was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",

      "Demonstrators crowded into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Trump, marching through downtowns and blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.",
      "Organizers of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Confrontations were isolated.",
      "But one person was transported to a Salt Lake City hospital Saturday night with life-threatening injuries after a shooting during that city's protest, officials said. Salt Lake City police said the shooting was \"possibly associated with the demonstration.\"",
      "Huge, boisterous crowds marched in New York, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, some behind \"no kings\" banners.",
      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight. Police said they found \"No Kings\" fliers and a list of other potential targets in the suspect's vehicle.",
      "In Texas, state legislators received a \"credible threat\" against them ahead of the planned protest at the state capitol building in Austin, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A suspect was later arrested.",
      "In other cities around the country, protests began as scheduled.",
      "Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.",
      "Light rain fell as marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia. They shouted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" as they marched to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they listened to speakers on the steps made famous in the movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building. Portland police said in a release early Sunday that three people were arrested near the ICE facility for \"criminal actions, and not constitutionally protected free speech.\"",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that ramped up last week, with Mr. Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles as some protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Democratic governors called Mr. Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",
      "Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.",
      "\"New Yorkers may have different emotions right now,\" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a briefing on Friday. \"And they have a right to express that, \u00a0but we want to be clear you do not have a right to engage in violence and lawlessness.\"",
      "New York City expected hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to turn out, with multiple protests planned around the area, organizers said.",
      "Though no major demonstration was expected in Washington, D.C., where the\u00a0military parade\u00a0will take place on what is also Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, some protesters gathered Saturday in Lafayette Square, across from the White House.",
      "What is No Kings Day?",
      "The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the\u00a050501 Movement, to support democracy and against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.",
      "Protesters have called for Mr. Trump to be \"dethroned\" as they compare his actions to those of a king and not a democratically elected president.",
      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",
      "Organizers timed the protests to counter the Army's 250th anniversary celebration, which included a military parade involving hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The parade has been estimated to cost between $25 million to $45 million, The Army expected the parade to attract as many as 200,000 people.",
      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",
      "The group says a core principle behind all \"No Kings\" events was a commitment to nonviolent action, and organizers urged participants to seek to de-escalate any confrontation.",

      "Nebraska's governor on Friday also signed an emergency proclamation for activating his state's National Guard, a step his office called \"a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"",
      "Organizers say that one march would go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the \"line is very clear\" and not to cross it. Another demonstration is set for Fort Lauderdale. Organizers told CBS News Miami they had hundreds of people registered for the event.",
      "Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers will be on \"tactical alert,\" which means all days off are canceled for all officers.",
      "Governors also urged calm.",
      "On social media, Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn't send military to the state.",

    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission.\"",

      "NASA captured an image of an intense solar flare released by the sun on Tuesday evening.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 5:49 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory said. It was an X-class flare \u2014 the most intense kind, NASA said. Solar flares are essentially \"giant explosions on the sun\" that send energy, light and high-speed particles into space, according to NASA.",
      "An image captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the sun, colorized in teal to draw attention to the flare. The flare is visible as a bright flash at the center of the sun. The heat of a solar flare causes it to appear bright.",
      "The energy from solar flares can be disruptive, NASA says on its website. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. They also can pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.",
      "Solar flares are also often associated with coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says online. Often, CMEs look like \"huge, twisted ropes,\" NASA says, because they involve the sun's magnetic fields. Coronal mass ejections can also disrupt radio and satellite communications, and can also cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.",
      "In May 2024, a powerful coronal mass ejection brought the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares were recorded. The storm caused some radio blackouts. Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",

    "summary": "The Colorado mother vanished in May 2020. Her husband, Barry, was about to go on trial for her murder.",
    "story": [
      "Case update: \u00a0Barry Morphew was arrested\u00a0in Arizona on June 20, 2025, two days after he was indicted on first-degree murder charges in the case of his wife's death. This was the second time Barry Morphew has been arrested and charged in Suzanne Morphew's death.",
      "In a high-profile case that has already seen numerous and sometimes odd twists and turns over the past three years, including crucial judicial sanctions, a judge agreed to dismiss all charges against Barry Morphew, without prejudice, just nine days before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife and mother of their two daughters, Suzanne Morphew.",
      "Prosecutors, who can re-file charges in the future, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment minutes before a pre-trial conference on April 19, 2022, with D.A. Linda Stanley writing they need to investigate further and believe \"we are close to discovering the victim's body.\"\u00a0 Stanley also cited the court's decision to exclude \"several key expert witnesses initially endorsed.\u00a0 Without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "\"First I want to say that Mr. Morphew not only was presumed innocent and still is presumed innocent, he is innocent,\" Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, said at a press conference after the charges were dropped.\u00a0 In response to the State pointing to the need to find Suzanne's body, she said, \"Forever they have stated that they don't need a body \u2014 that a body is irrelevant.\u00a0 But you need to know, that in this case, there has been not a single ounce of physical evidence that has been found connecting Mr. Morphew to this \u2026 alleged crime.\"",
      "Since Barry Morphew's arrest, his defense attorneys had asked Judge Ramsey Lama, multiple times, to dismiss the charges against him. Over the past several months, they pressed the judge to issue severe sanctions on the prosecution for failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence ahead of trial.\u00a0 And the judge imposed damaging sanctions, including barring 11 of their 16 endorsed expert witnesses \u2014 among others, experts in DNA, vehicle data and a cell phone data analyst, as punishment for violating discovery rules. In all, the Court excluded 14 of the prosecution's expert witnesses.\u00a0 The judge found that DA Stanley and her team repeatedly missed deadlines and failed to turn over important information, writing, \"The People's actions amount to negligent and arguably, reckless disregard\" for their discovery obligations.",
      "In earlier filings, prosecutors said that the Court did not find willful misconduct associated with any discovery violations, noting \"ultimately the sanctions imposed greatly damage the People's case, tantamount to dismissal, for late disclosures that were not greatly prejudicial, but rather technical in nature.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant updates the case in \"The Suzanne Morphew Case: Nothing is What It Seems,\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "When Suzanne Morphew, a Colorado mother of two girls, vanished on Mother's Day in May 2020, authorities wondered if she'd been abducted or if her husband Barry \u2014 whom she had threatened to divorce \u2014 might have killed her.",
      "Investigators never expected the case would have so many bizarre twists and turns and eventually involve a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, a \"talking\" truck, mystery DNA and a spy pen right out of a James Bond film.",
      "\"This case is incredibly unique,\" says Aya Gruber, a law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder. \"When you started to dig a little bit deeper, nothing is what it seems.\"",
      "Gruber studied thousands of pages of public documents from the prosecutor, investigators and defense attorneys.",
      "Suzanne was reported missing on May 10, 2020. She'd been alone that day because her daughters, Macy, 16, and Mallory, 20, were off on a church-sponsored camping trip and planned to return home later that Mother's Day.",
      "At the same time, Barry Morphew\u00a0told investigators he had left the home early in the morning to drive to a job site some three hours away. He said the last time he saw his wife of 25 years was when she was sleeping in their bed.",
      "After Suzanne was officially reported missing by a neighbor, investigators began to examine Barry's story. Friends and relatives told investigators that the marriage was troubled, and agents found a deleted text from Suzanne to Barry on his phone that read: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "But 10 days after Suzanne disappeared, agents were pulled in a different direction when they found a so-called spy pen belonging to Suzanne. The spy pen has a long battery life and is designed to look and write like an ordinary pen.",
      "But it has one extra feature: it is voice-activated and records conversations. Suzanne had acquired it, she told a friend, because she suspected Barry was having an affair and she hoped to use the pen to gather evidence. But the plan backfired.",
      "Investigators listened to what the pen had recorded and, although there was no evidence of Barry having an affair, they say they heard \"intimate\" conversations between Suzanne and someone named Jeff.",
      "It was another twist in a case filled with them.",
      "Without knowing who Jeff was or his location when Suzanne went missing, they could not eliminate him as a person or interest. It took FBI agents six months before they uncovered his identity: Jeff Libler, a man both Suzanne and Barry knew from their Alexandria, Indiana, high school. Jeff and Suzanne had had a one-time fling after graduation, and she'd reached out to him in 2018 after the Morphews moved to Colorado with a Facebook message that read simply: \"Howdy stranger.\"",
      "\"And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop,\" said Ashley Franco, a reporter for KKTV, the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, who has covered the story from the beginning.",
      "That was enough to ignite a nearly two-year love affair. Jeff had a wife and six children. He lived in Michigan and claimed to be there with his family on the day Suzanne vanished.",
      "Agents eventually discovered the lovers had spoken to each other for dozens of hours, often communicating via secret accounts on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Jeff also admitted that they met for romantic rendezvous in New Orleans, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.",
      "After Suzanne disappeared in May 2020, Jeff did not contact authorities. Instead, agents say, he deleted the accounts where he had communicated with Suzanne.",
      "\"What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne,\" says Gruber. \"He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\"",
      "Jeff reportedly told agents he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory, but he also told them he worried that he'd lose his wife, children and job. He also worried he might be considered a suspect. \"He asks the agents, 'Am I a target?'\" says Gruber.",
      "After agents confronted him, he did cooperate, providing a sample of his DNA and passwords to the deleted accounts. Investigators eventually were able to retrace the couple's steps and recovered texts by tapping into the iCloud accounts of Jeff and Suzanne.",
      "Jeff was able to provide receipts for a home goods store he'd visited in Michigan on the day Suzanne vanished and he was eventually cleared.",
      "Investigators still had their suspicions about Barry Morphew. They never uncovered any evidence that he was having an affair, but investigators found his actions on that Mother's Day weekend to be suspicious.",
      "They asked Barry why his phone seemed to be pinging all around his house on the day before Mother's Day and he told them he must have been out shooting chipmunks, which he said were a constant nuisance at the house.",
      "It was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi, but Barry stood by it, saying he'd shot 85 chipmunks in the two years he owned that Colorado house.",
      "\"And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him,\" says Gruber.",
      "Van Sant asked why. \"Because [agents are] saying, 'Well, you know, now he's admitting to having run around the house. And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person,'\" says Gruber.",
      "What's more, there was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around the house and neighbors did not recall hearing any type of disturbance during that period of time.",
      "Cases sometimes turn on the smallest of things and, in this case, agents seized upon just such a small item.",
      "Agents had found a small clear plastic cap in the family's dryer that they believed was from a syringe used to inject chemicals into a tranquilizer dart. Barry acknowledged he knew how to inject chemicals into a dart and that he'd shot many deer for trophies and so he could get their antlers. His garage was filled with deer heads and a pile of antlers. However, there was no working tranquilizer gun found in the home and authorities say Barry's DNA was not on that plastic cap.",
      "Even so, investigators developed a theory that Barry had shot Suzanne with a tranquilizer gun and then chased her around the house before she passed out. They found a door frame that was broken and suspected there had been a confrontation.",
      "Agents also tapped into a new investigative tool called digital vehicle forensics. They pulled data from his Ford truck's many computers and got the truck to \"talk\" to them. They learned that when Barry said he was sleeping, the truck's doors were opening and closing.",
      "He was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in May 2021. Suzanne's body has not been found and prosecutors presume she is dead. Barry eventually pleaded \"not guilty.\"",
      "But at the eleventh hour, there was one more twist revealed for the first time publicly at a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence for probable cause.",
      "Prosecutors admitted at a hearing held in the summer of 2021 that their own forensics team had uncovered DNA evidence that threatened to destroy their case against Barry. State technicians had found DNA on the glove compartment of Suzanne's car that partially matched an unknown male connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in three different cities.",
      "Barry Morphew and Jeff Libler were excluded from that DNA sample which meant there was a chance Suzanne had fallen into the hands of a sexual predator. \"This DNA discovery is so significant,\" Gruber said. \"All of a sudden, the seemingly implausible becomes more possible.\"",
      "Judge Patrick Murphy wwas candid in his assessment of the case, saying it could go either way before a jury. He found enough probable cause to put it over for trial but ordered that Barry be released on $500,000 bond, observing that he thought there was not \"a fair likelihood\" that Barry would be convicted by a jury. Barry entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.",
      "Barry Morphew raised the bond money and is free awaiting trial. \u00a0Judge Murphy disqualified himself because of a potential conflict of interest involving a witness, and Judge Ramsey Lama was appointed in January 2022.\u00a0 Morphew's trial, which was moved from Chaffee to Fremont County, Colorado, was scheduled to begin on April 28.",
      "Then, on April 19, Stanley and her team filed the motion to drop all charges, without prejudice, until they gather more evidence.\u00a0 But Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice so that it cannot be refiled.\u00a0 The court dismissed the charges without prejudice.",
      "At the press conference outside court, Eytan made it clear her opinion that her client should never have been charged.",
      "\"These charges were false from the beginning \u2026 The prosecution was manufacturing a murder case,\" she said.\u00a0 \"You've seen shows called 'Making a Murderer?' That's what was happening here in this courtroom \u2026 They absolutely dismissed this case at this point because they knew they were going to lose this trial and Mr. Morphew was going to be acquitted and exonerated.\"",
      "\"Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew,\" Eytan said. \"He loves her and he misses her and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.\u00a0 It's a big question mark \u2026 Definitely there was not any evidence, even close to convicting him of murder of his wife.\"",
      "As investigators continue searching for Suzanne Morphew's body, focusing on a \"remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence,\" as the DA wrote in her motion, waiting for five feet of snow to melt before they can safely excavate the area, Barry Morphew, alongside his daughters, walked out of the Fremont County courthouse a free man. With all charges against him dropped, his bond is lifted, his GPS ankle monitor removed, and his passport returned. \u00a0And about 1,000 people who had been summoned to appear for jury selection are released.",
      "In May 2023, Barry Morphew filed\u00a0 a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom in Los Angeles on Friday, and referred to Sen. Alex Padilla as \"Jos\u00e9 Padilla.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 During a visit with federal law enforcement in Los Angeles on Friday, Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration still believes a military deployment to the city is necessary.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the Los Angeles area since protests broke out in the nation's second-largest city over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. He gave brief remarks after touring a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a federal mobile command center, and meeting with leadership and Marines on the ground.",
      "President Trump federalized\u00a0thousands of troops\u00a0from the California National Guard in response to the Los Angeles-area protests and ordered about 700 Marines to be deployed to protect federal property. The president\u00a0has directed\u00a0federal immigration authorities to prioritize deporting individuals from Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, and a series of ICE operations in L.A.\u00a0sparked the protests\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The deployments drew a lawsuit from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who argued the presence of military forces could inflame the situation. Late Thursday, a federal appeals court\u00a0allowed\u00a0the president to keep control of the National Guard troops he deployed to the Los Angeles region, halting a ruling from a lower court judge who said the president acted illegally when he activated the troops over objections from Newsom. The protests have waned, but the troops remain.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Friday, Vance said the situation has \"gotten a lot better,\" but the Marines and National Guard forces are still \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" arguing the protests could \"flare back up.\"",
      "The vice president also alleged that Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had \"egged on\" violence during the protests. The administration has accused state and local officials of failing to protect federal immigration agents from threats and interference from protesters. Local authorities have pushed back, arguing federal authorities are responsible for the chaos.",
      "\"I would absolutely say that Gavin Newsom is endangering law enforcement,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance suggested the administration is willing to use the Guard in other places, but that it hopes not to.",
      "\"If you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,\" the vice president said.",
      "In a news conference Friday night, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said Vance was \"spewing lies and utter nonsense in an attempt to promote division and conflict in our city.\"",
      "Vance calls Sen. Alex Padilla \"Jos\u00e9 Padilla\"",
      "At one point, Vance referred to Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, as \"Jos\u00e9 Padilla.\"",
      "\"I was hoping Jos\u00e9 Padilla would be here to ask a question, but unfortunately, I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't the theater,\" Vance said.",
      "The senator made news last week after he was\u00a0forcibly removed\u00a0from a press conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, an incident Vance called \"pure political theater.\"",
      "\"Mr. vice president, how dare you disrespect our senator,\" Bass said in her news conference. \"You don't know his name? But yet you served with him before you were vice president, and you continue to serve with him today. Because last time I checked, the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate. You serve with him today, but how dare you disrespect him and call him Jos\u00e9. But I guess he just looked like anybody to you.\"",
      "Newsom said Friday in a post on X that mixing up Padilla's name was \"not an accident,\" noting that Vance and Padilla served in the Senate together.",
      "\"It was very generous of the Vice President to take time out of his closed-door fundraiser to stage a photo op in front of a fire truck \u2014 where he 'mistakenly' called a Latino U.S. Senator 'Jose,'\" Newsom's office said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the senator told CBS News the remark was an \"unserious comment from an unserious administration.\"",
      "\"As a former colleague of Senator Padilla, the Vice President knows better. He should be more focused on demilitarizing our city than taking cheap shots,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "\"He must have mixed up two people who have broken the law,\" Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told CBS News.",
      "One of the more high-profile Jos\u00e9 Padillas was sentenced to prison on terrorism and conspiracy charges over a decade ago, on allegations that he worked with al-Qaeda.",
      "On Thursday, federal agents were seen\u00a0outside the Los Angeles Dodgers ballpark, after the team said it blocked immigration authorities from entering. Fans protested, and the Department of Homeland Security said Customs and Border Patrol vehicles \"were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement.\"",
      "Federal immigration officers have stepped up enforcement efforts, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller saying ICE officers are aiming for at least 3,000 arrests a day. So far, the number of arrests has failed to reach that target, with a daily average of about 1,200 arrests in the month of June as of earlier this week.",
      "Back in Washington, Mr. Trump is handling international matters, particularly the Israel-Iran conflict. In a statement on Thursday, the president said he will decide whether the U.S. will join Israel in its strikes in the next two weeks. The president traveled to Bedminster, New Jersey, for a fundraising dinner Friday night after meetings with his national security team at the White House.",

      "The death of the 49-year-old Colorado mother who went missing was officially declared a homicide, according to an autopsy report released on April 29, 2024. This revelation came two years after prosecutors dropped murder charges against her husband just as he was about to stand trial.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were found\u00a0during a search on Sept. 22, 2023, and positively identified by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation on Sept. 27, 2023. She was last seen on Mother's Day, May 10, 2020.",
      "[This story previously aired on April 30, 2022. It was updated on July 1, 2023.]",
      "This past week, a prosecutor working on the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing mother of two, said in open court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body. \"She is in a very difficult spot,\" said Deputy District Attorney Mark Hurlbert. \"We actually have more than just a feeling \u2026 and the sheriff's office is continuing to look for Mrs. Morphew's body.\"",
      "It was a major update in the Morphew case which began on Mother's Day 2020, when she disappeared from her Colorado home. Hurlbert said there was no timetable for bringing a murder case to trial. \"That could be a long time. It could be quick, it could be long. It depends on a lot of our investigation,\" he said.",
      "When Suzanne first went missing, investigators compiled and followed several bizarre clues\u2014a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen\u2014but lacked direct evidence.",
      "Investigators noticed Barry's cell phone appeared to be pinging all around his house on Mother's Day weekend 2020, which he maintains was because he was chasing and shooting at chipmunks. Investigators also found a plastic cap for a syringe that they believe was used to load a tranquilizer dart in the couple's dryer. Barry, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, did not contain any of Barry's DNA.",
      "Investigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne and a secret lover. Investigators also uncovered DNA on the glovebox of Suzanne's Range Rover, which traced back to an unknown male connected to three sexual assaults.",
      "MISSING ON MOTHER'S DAY",
      "Dan Ridenour [riding in car with Peter Van Sant]: What happened on this road is a real mystery. No one knows. Where is Suzanne?",
      "In the days, weeks and months after Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, her trail went cold, but the mother of two's disappearance had become the biggest story in Colorado.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [talking to searchers, CBS Denver news report]:\u00a0We're gonna fan out and were gonna work that area very carefully, OK?",
      "Four months in, Suzanne's brother, Andrew Moorman, organized a citizen's search. He said he felt he had to do something \u2014 anything.",
      "ANDREW MOORMAN [to CBS Denver]: I hope to find her alive and at some point, you have to realize when somebody's been missing after so long, that the chances of that diminish dramatically.",
      "The thought that Suzanne may have been abducted hit the peaceful, picturesque town of Salida hard.",
      "Dan Ridenour: I came home every day and my wife asked me, \"had they found her yet?\"",
      "Dan Ridenour has covered the story for his local morning show.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry and Suzanne Morphew were not known well in Salida, Colorado \u2026They had only been here for a couple of years.",
      "Before moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry and Suzanne grew up in the small town of Alexandria, Indiana, where they met in high school. Suzanne competed for homecoming queen. Barry was a star baseball player who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. Injury ended Barry's dreams of a major league career. They both attended Purdue University and married in 1994. He started a landscaping business. Suzanne taught middle school before becoming a full-time mother.",
      "Dan Ridenour: They had a couple of daughters \u2026 one in college \u2026 And they had a daughter in high school \u2026",
      "Macy, 16 years old when her mom disappeared, lived at home. Her sister Mallory attended college and the Morphews told some friends they moved to a home just outside of Salida to be closer to their older daughter. But there were also rumblings about the state of the Morphew's marriage.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Maybe a new place, a new \u2014 home, new scenery around them \u2026 would strengthen their family and therefore strengthen their marriage.",
      "But the move did not appear to improve the relationship. It was a tough time, says her sister Melinda Moorman.",
      "Melinda Moorman: My sister had sent me a text message \u2026 It was very lengthy. It was very powerful. It was very revealing.",
      "In a Zoom interview, Melinda said she received Suzanne's text two days before she disappeared, and it was boiling over with anger toward Barry.",
      "The text read in part: \"He's also been abusive emotionally and physically\u2026 I feel more angry now. Anger at what I've allowed.\"",
      "Melinda Moorman: Barry was very dominant in the relationship, and my sister was a very passive, gentle soul \u2026 he had \u2026 a great tendency to overpower, intimidate people to get what he wanted.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what kinda boss was he?",
      "Cody Cox: You know, he was real quiet \u2026 stern \u2026 He knew what he was doin', 'cause that's what he did in Indiana.",

      "Cody said he regularly heard Barry talking to Suzanne as they drove in Barry's truck.",
      "Cody Cox: : \u2026 they seemed to communicate pretty well. Like I said, I could hear almost every phone call he had.",
      "And he says he met Suzanne a handful of times; she even made cookies for his wife and kids.",
      "Cody Cox: She was a sweetheart. She was a real kind lady \u2026 She's almost like an angel, like somethin' you'd see off a Hallmark movie, you know \u2026 real nice, almost too perfect.",
      "Cody Cox: So, when I heard about the news, I didn't believe it \u2026 I heard it actually on the radio. And I was like, \"Did they just say Suzanne?\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh. Who'd even wanna hurt her?\"",
      "The first day authorities searched for Suzanne, they found her mountain bike close to the Morphew home.",
      "Peter Van Sant [at ravine]: Where was the mountain bike found?",
      "Dan Ridenour [pointing]: It was found right over this little cliff right here resting on these boulders.",
      "Dan Ridenour: She was new at mountain biking. So, an accident is certainly plausible. I would only ask, \"Where's Suzanne?\"",

      "Peter Van Sant: So, this side of the road?",
      "Dan Ridenour: Which would be to our left.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, is the thought somebody threw it out of a window, perhaps?",
      "Dan Ridenour: That's the thinking, yes \u2026",
      "It appeared as though Suzanne could have been abducted, and that's when Barry made a videotaped public plea on social media. In those early days, Barry had a theory about what happened to Suzanne that he shared with Tyson Draper who has his own YouTube channel.",

      "A mountain lion killed her?",
      "Dan Ridenour: If that happened, there would have been signs of that \u2026 There would've been blood, there would've been a struggle \u2026 So, that was a very short-lived speculation.",
      "Authorities began to doubt that Suzanne even took a bike ride, especially after her sunglasses and hydration backpack were found in her car.\u00a0 Investigators also found her driver's license and credit cards in her Range Rover. But her cell phone was missing.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did Barry Morphew cooperate with investigators during the course of this?",
      "Ashley Franco: He had been interviewed by investigators through the course of it and he talked to investigators almost every time.",
      "Ashley Franco, who reported on the case for the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, KKTV, has read the police documents and she says Barry has repeatedly told the same story. He came home around 3 p.m. on May 9, 2020 and had a pleasant evening with Suzanne. The next morning, Mother's Day, Barry says he drove to a job some 3 hours away.",
      "Ashley Franco: He says the last time he sees his wife is when she's sleeping in their bed.",
      "As investigators began trying to verify Barry's alibi, they were pulled in a new direction. Suzanne's spy pen had surfaced with that intimate conversation. Now they needed to figure out the identity of \"Jeff,\" Suzanne's lover.",
      "Ashley Franco: Could this man have had something to do with Suzanne's disappearance?",
      "SUZANNE'S SECRET LOVER IDENTIFIED",
      "It was just days after Suzanne Morphew went missing when investigators make that intriguing discovery.",
      "Aya Gruber: They discover a spy pen.",
      "Peter Van Sant: A spy pen?",
      "Peter Van Sant: A spy pen.",
      "Aya Gruber is a law professor and a former defense attorney.\u00a0 She has closely studied all the public investigative files in the Morphew case; she knows it was not easy for investigators to find Suzanne's secret lover: a man named \"Jeff.\"",
      "Aya Gruber: She hid that affair so well that it took \u2026 agents six months to find the man she was having an affair with.",
      "\"Jeff\" turned out to be Jeff Libler and he had a wife and six children in Michigan where he lived. He and Suzanne had a one-time fling after high school. Decades passed until Suzanne reached out to Jeff, out of the blue, in 2018.",
      "Ashley Franco: When Suzanne and Barry moved to Colorado, Suzanne messaged him on Facebook.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did she message him?",
      "Ashley Franco: \"Howdy Stranger.\" \u2026 And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop.",
      "In the months after Suzanne went missing, Jeff kept quiet.\u00a0 He only began cooperating after he was located by investigators, who learned Jeff had taken steps to hide the nearly two-year affair.",
      "Aya Gruber: What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne. \u2026 He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.",
      "Jeff told agents he only took those steps because he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory and worried he might lose his family and job. He was also worried agents considered him a suspect.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 he asks the agents, \"Am I a target?\"",
      "Although he did not come forward on his own, Jeff did assist agents after they found him. He agreed to provide access to his DNA, phone records and his passwords for those deleted accounts. By looking through the couple's iCloud accounts and phone records, agents were able to piece together their relationship, including the times they met in person.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators also found that Suzanne, on several instances, had gone on vacation to meet up with Jeff in many different states, ranging from Louisiana to Florida.",
      "Investigators also discovered they'd sent intimate photos to each other, talked of becoming husband and wife, and even mentioned leaving the United States.",
      "Ashley Franco: Jeff and Suzanne had talked about moving away \u2026 moving to Ecuador at one point \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: If you were an investigator instead of a law professor, what would you wanna know about this Jeff Libler?",
      "Aya Gruber: Everything. I'd wanna know everything about what he was doing, what he was thinking. \u2026 Here is somebody who arguably had the last communication \u2026 with Suzanne before she went missing.",
      "The love affair between Suzanne and Jeff became a key part of the investigation as agents tried to figure out what happened to her on that Saturday, May 9, the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Records show that Suzanne and Jeff messaged each other 59 times that day, much more than usual, authorities say.",
      "At one point, Suzanne sends Jeff a selfie. Investigators dub it her last \"proof of life\" photo. Barry was not home, as the lovers' texts heat up:",
      "At 2:05 p.m., Suzanne writes: \"I'm just in love with you. Whatcha up to?\"",
      "Jeff's response at 2:06 p.m. was: \"Want to strip down and get naked? LOL??\"",
      "She responds by saying she'll \"load up\" her WhatsApp account and then at 2:11 p.m., Suzanne writes, \"Okay I'm on WA\".",
      "Then, at 2:26 p.m., Suzanne gets a text from Barry that he's heading home. \"Done headed back.\"",
      "No one knows if Suzanne saw that text or was preoccupied with Jeff, but she does not answer.",
      "Barry follows up, appearing to wonder where Suzanne is. \"Did you leave?\"",
      "There was still no response from Suzanne and investigators speculate the next few moments are when Barry returned home. They notice that Barry's cell phone appears to be pinging all around the outside of his house. Was he chasing Suzanne before a final and fatal confrontation?",
      "Investigators asked Barry to explain that unusual phone activity.",
      "Aya Gruber: And he says, \"Well, lemme think about that. I was probably walking around my house shooting chipmunks.\"",
      "You heard right \u2014 it was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi.\u00a0 Barry says the chipmunks were a constant nuisance at his house and he'd been running around shooting them that day.",
      "Aya Gruber: And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him.",
      "There was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews \u2014 all without a lawyer \u2014 to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?",
      "Aya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.",
      "Meanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared. He told agents he was in Michigan that weekend and his alibi checked out. When investigators tell Barry of the affair, he denies knowing anything about it.",
      "But if Barry knew nothing about Suzanne's affair, what motive would he have to kill her? One clue may be a deleted text that investigators found on Barry's phone sent by Suzanne just days before: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "Dan Ridenour: So, the only thing that makes sense is that Barry Morphew lost it when Suzanne finally said, \"I'm leaving you.\"",
      "Barry knew that his daughters would be away on their camping trip that Saturday afternoon and authorities say he took advantage of that opportunity to kill Suzanne and clean up the crime scene.",
      "Peter Van Sant: From 2:47 p.m. until 10:17 p.m., just under 8 hours, Barry's phone goes into airplane mode. What do authorities believe happened during that time?",
      "Ashley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.",
      "Unable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique \u2014 digital vehicle forensics \u2014 to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck. And Barry's truck told a different story than what he was telling investigators.",

      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case \u2014 come from the data in the car \u2026",
      "Ashley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.",
      "Authorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.",
      "Initially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m.",
      "Investigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed, but there is a 4-hour window\u2014approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\u2014when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.",
      "Aya Gruber: \u2026 there are events in the car \u2014 that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.",
      "And if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?",
      "Ben Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer \u2026 Log files, they only last so long.",
      "But Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk.",
      "Ashley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.",
      "That admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.",
      "At 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.",
      "Ashley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can \u2026 a dumpster \u2026 in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \"trash runs,\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.",
      "In a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in \u2014 in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it \u2014 disposed at a landfill, I \u2014 this is just what I do.",
      "Ashley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?",
      "After checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother.",
      "That's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her \u2026 her bicycle is not here.",
      "Barry asks his neighbor to call 911.",
      "Dan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 \u2026 was placed, that Suzanne is missing.",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers.",
      "Tools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room.",
      "Ashley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that \u2026 the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Which suggests what?",
      "Ashley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.",
      "Just after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m.",
      "Ashley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes.",
      "By Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.",
      "Investigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:",
      "\"He won't speak of divorce \u2026\"",
      "\"I feel no peace when he's here \u2026\"",
      "\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him \u2026\"",
      "Barry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.",
      "DID BARRY TARGET SUZANNE?",
      "While investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.",
      "Aya\u00a0Gruber: \u2026 police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners \u2026 when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.",
      "Aya Gruber: Absolutely.",
      "Sometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer. Prosecutors believe the cap was from a syringe used to fill a tranquilizer dart.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?",
      "Aya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals \u2026",
      "There was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell.",
      "We asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\"",
      "Dan Ridenour [reading]: \"And I'll tell you exactly what I did \u2026 I shoot 'em. They go to sleep, I cut their horns off \u2026 It's totally illegal \u2026 But you're gonna find tranq darts around my property because I've done that.\"",
      "Experts say it can take between 4 and 20 minutes for an animal the size of a deer to drop after being shot with a tranquilizer dart. Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house\u2014not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.",
      "Ashley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.",
      "Andrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what are you holding?",
      "Andrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle \u2026 they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?",
      "Andrew Katers: It only fires darts. \u2026 It's impossible to \u2014 get it to do anything else.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?",
      "Andrew Katers: Sure. [fires rifle]",
      "Peter\u00a0Van Sant: So, if Suzanne had been struck by one of these darts \u2026 would she have time to run around, try to escape?",
      "Andrew Katers: She could. But I don't think she would get very far.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For a human being, it could be lethal.",
      "Andrew Katers: For sure.",
      "Bolstering the theory that Barry and Suzanne had a confrontation the day she disappeared were apparent scratches seen on Barry's left arm. Agents took the circumstantial evidence they gathered \u2014 Barry's apparently suspicious behavior, his contradictory statements, the puzzling data from his truck, Suzanne's disturbing texts and those five trash runs \u2014 and brought it all to the district attorney.",
      "On nearly the anniversary of Suzanne's disappearance, Barry is arrested in May 2021.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Tonight, the husband of Suzanne Morphew is behind bars accused of killing her. \u2026 The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office says that Barry Morphew was arrested this morning.",
      "Suzanne's body has never been found and the prosecutors assume she's dead. Despite the lack of a body, Barry was charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and a variety of other allegations. He was held without bail and eventually pleaded not guilty.",
      "In their arrest affidavit, prosecutors spelled out what they believe happened to Suzanne:",
      "\"It had become clear that Barry could not control Suzanne's insistence on leaving him and he resorted to something he has done his entire life \u2014 hunt and control Suzanne like he had hunted and controlled animals.\"",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda reacted to the news of Barry's arrest.",
      "Melinda Moorman: There are no winners in this story. There are two families who are suffering deeply.",
      "Barry ultimately hired high-profile lawyers from Denver, and, in the summer of 2021, Judge Patrick Murphy heard the prosecution's evidence in open court.",
      "Ashley Franco: He decided to hold a preliminary hearing to see if this case had enough evidence to go to trial.",
      "The defense tried mightily to blunt the state's case, countering that the clear, plastic cap found in the dryer means nothing because no one could say how long it had been there. Furthermore, Suzanne's DNA was found on the cap, not Barry's. And as for that chlorine smell in Barry's hotel room \u2026",
      "Aya Gruber: One of the managers from the Holiday Inn had actually communicated to agents that this smell of chlorine existed before Barry Morphew was there \u2026 because that room's directly above an indoor pool.",
      "And there was one more crucial issue the prosecution had to deal with \u2014 one that its own forensic team uncovered. DNA evidence made public for the first time now threatened to destroy the case against Barry.",
      "Aya Gruber: This DNA discovery is so significant. The agents swab the inside of Suzanne Morphew's car and they found male DNA on the glove box, and it wasn't Barry Morphew's DNA. He was eliminated.",
      "The DNA also did not match Suzanne's lover Jeff Libler. But it did partially match the DNA of an unknown male who had attacked other women and it raised a disturbing question: had Suzanne fallen into the hands of a sexual predator?",
      "DA: AUTHORITIES ARE \"CLOSE\" TO FINDING SUZANNE'S BODY",
      "In September 2021 at the Chaffee County Courthouse in Salida, Judge Patrick Murphy heard arguments about whether there was enough evidence to try Barry Morphew for murder.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge named off three different scenarios, saying, \"Suzanne Morphew left willingly, Barry Morphew could have killed his wife, or someone else abducted Suzanne and killed her.\"",
      "He said it was \"unlikely\" Suzanne had run off on her own, even though she and lover Jeff Libler had discussed moving to Ecuador.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge says that because of the evidence that's \u2026 been presented about how loving Suzanne was toward her daughters and toward her family \u2026 that she could never do that.\"",
      "But the abduction theory could not be so easily dismissed \u2014 especially after that mysterious DNA was found in Suzanne's Range Rover. Investigators learned that DNA at least partially matched the profile of an unnamed man connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in Tempe, Phoenix and Chicago.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how can that DNA end up in her car?",
      "Aya Gruber: Well, that DNA can end up in her car if she was the victim, for example, of a serial killer \u2026 or if the person was hired or opportunistic \u2026 There could also be potentially an innocent explanation that at some point, you know, the person came in contact with the car randomly as a mechanic \u2026 but it is very, very curious.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Barry Morphew can stand up and say, \"I'm not your killer. The man whose DNA is in my wife's car, tied to past sexual assaults, that's your killer.\"",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew absolutely could say that. And that's what his defense is banking on in this case.",
      "In frank language, Judge Murphy gave his opinion of the state's evidence: \"I find that the proof is not evident nor is the presumption great that Mr. Morphew committed first-degree murder.\"",
      "Despite that, the judge ruled there was probable cause to go to trial.",
      "Aya Gruber: But this judge was very careful to say, \"Look, I'm finding probable cause here, but it's only because I am looking at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"",
      "Murphy said he was \"obligated\" to set bond for Barry.",
      "Ashley Franco: The judge sets $500,000 cash-only bond.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And are they monitoring him in some fashion?",
      "Ashley Franco: Barry Morphew is wearing an ankle monitor for them to track him, to make sure that he is staying in Chaffee County.",
      "A few days later on September 20, 2021, Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy are all smiles as they leave the jail. They stand firmly behind their dad. Barry declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview.",
      "Barry Morphew's homicide trial was to begin on April 28, 2022, but in the months leading up to that date Judge Murphy recused himself and and was replaced by Judge Ramsey Lama.. And Barry's defense team, led by attorney Iris Eytan, filed motions asking that prosecutors be sanctioned for \"failing to produce discovery in a timely manner\" including some potentially exculpatory evidence \u2014  like the male DNA found in Suzanne's Range Rover.",
      "Iris Eytan: There's DNA that is placed on all the critical items of evidence in this case \u2014 on the bike, on the bike helmet, in the house, in the car \u2014   that is linked to unknown males.",
      "In April 2022, Judge Lama ruled that prosecutors repeatedly had missed deadlines and had failed to turn over important information in the discovery phase. The judge wrote that while he did not find those actions \"willful \u2026 the court does find this pattern to be negligent, bordering on, reckless.\" The judge's penalty was to knock out 14 prosecution witnesses \u2014 including experts in DNA and cell phone and vehicle data recovery. They would not, he said, be allowed to testify.",
      "Law professor Aya Gruber said the case was going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors even before she heard about the most recent sanctions.",
      "Aya Gruber: This case is incredibly unique. There are not many \u2026 murder cases \u2014   where the defendant has been charged with first-degree murder, where there is no body, no blood evidence of any foul play, no eyewitnesses.",
      "On April 19, 2022, as a pre-trial hearing was about to begin, District Attorney Linda Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges against Barry Morphew without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled at a later date. In her motion, the DA pointed to the court's decision to bar \"several key witnesses \u2026 without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "Neither Barry, his daughters nor his lawyer had any advance warning.",
      "Iris Eytan: I didn't know a dismissal was coming today, although the writing was on the wall \u2026",
      "In her motion for dismissal, Stanley told the judge that officials believe they are close to discovering the location of Suzanne Morphew's body. Court papers specifically mentioned \"a remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence\" that will be excavated after five feet of snow melts.",
      "Dan Ridenour: Where is Suzanne Morphew's body? That is the million-dollar question.",
      "Remember, there was an approximate four-hour gap not recorded by the computers in Barry's truck on Mother's Day morning 2020. Whether investigators ultimately were able to recover some of that missing data or received a tip about the location of Suzanne's remains is not known.",
      "Dan Ridenour: The San Isabel National Forest, again, is 1.1 million acres. There's plenty of places to dispose of \u2014  of a body.",
      "Defense attorney Eytan denies Barry has any involvement in his wife's disappearance.",
      "Iris Eytan: Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew.\u00a0 He loves her and he misses her, and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.",
      "After the judge granted the motion to dismiss homicide charges against Barry, he walked out of court a free man, flanked as usual by his loyal daughters.",
      "Suzanne's sister Melinda says she agrees with the request to dismiss charges against Barry at this point. She said she hoped that, with more time, searchers will find Suzanne's body and win \"a solid conviction in her murder. This would dispel all rumors of her whereabouts.\"",
      "And whatever else happens with the case, Melinda says she hopes her nieces keep one thing in mind.",
      "Melinda Moorman: \"Mallory, Macy \u2026 Your mother would have laid down her life for you girls \u2026 She would never leave you. She would never forsake you. She loved you with her whole being.",
      "In May 2023, Barry Morphew filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-launch-austin-texas-elon-musk-june-22/",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:57:05 -0400",
    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "This Sunday, June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \"wrong\" when she testified in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, marking the second time in a week the president has dismissed the assessment of the intelligence director he selected.",
      "The White House this week said Iran has everything it needs to build a nuclear weapon and needs only the green light from Iran's supreme leader, with the ability to ready a nuclear weapon within weeks. Mr. Trump said Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon.",
      "In March, Gabbard testified on Capitol Hill that the U.S. \"continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.\" Gabbard later insisted she and the president are on the same page.",
      "Mr. Trump dismissed his intelligence community's public assessment of Iran on Friday, and Gabbard specifically, as the White House says the president will decide whether to join Israel in its strikes on Iran within two weeks.",
      "When the president arrived in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday, a reporter asked him: \"What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? Your intelligence community had said they have no evidence that they are at this point.\"",
      "\"Well then, my intelligence community is wrong,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Who in the intelligence community said that?\"",
      "\"Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,\" the reporter answered.",
      "\"She's wrong,\" Mr. Trump said, moving on to the next question.",
      "The president previously dismissed Gabbard's testimony earlier this week, on his way back from a G7 summit in Canada. A reporter noted that Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"I don't care what she said,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I think they were very close to having one.\"",
      "In a post on X, Gabbard accused media outlets of \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "\"America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly,\" Gabbard wrote.",
      "Vice President JD Vance\u00a0wrote on X on Tuesday that \"Tulsi's testimony was in March, and a lot has changed since then.\"",
      "The president has been briefed on the risks and the benefits of bombing\u00a0Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, multiple sources told CBS News this week.\u00a0His mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the president will make a decision on whether to join Israel's strikes within two weeks and allow the diplomatic path to play out.",
      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" the president said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing. The Iranian foreign minister met with a group of European diplomats in Geneva on Friday.",
      "Asked Friday if a strike could be possible before the two-week deadline is up, the president said: \"I'm giving them a period of time. We'll see what that period of time is. I'm giving them a period of time. But two weeks would be the maximum.\"",

    "story": [
      "A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state's public school classrooms is unconstitutional.",
      "The ruling on Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students \u2014 especially those who are not Christian.",
      "\"Parents and students challenge a statute requiring public schools to permanently display the Ten Commandments in every classroom in Louisiana,\" the court said in its ruling. \"The district court found the statute facially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined its enforcement. We AFFIRM.\"",
      "The mandate, which took effect Jan. 1, has been touted by Republicans, including President Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "The ruling from the largely conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.",
      "\"As noted, if H.B. 71 goes into effect, Students will be subjected to unwelcome displays of the Ten Commandments for the entirety of their public school education,\" the judges wrote. \"There is no opt-out option.\"",
      "Louisiana in June 2024 became the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law. The law required a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.",
      "The court's ruling backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",
      "Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the conservative court on the issue of religion and government.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.",
      "In 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.",

      "The brother-in-law of the fugitive Jalisco New Generation boss known as \"El Mencho\" was sentenced Friday to 30 years in U.S. federal prison following his 2017 arrest at a beach resort in Brazil while vacationing with his family under a fake name.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, 49, was sentenced in a federal court in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors said that for years he orchestrated a prolific drug trafficking operation, using a semi-submersible and other methods to avoid detection, and provided weapons to one of Mexico's most powerful cartels.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, known as \"Chepa,\" along with his two brothers, led a group called \"Los Cuinis\" that financed the drug trafficking operations of Jalisco New Generation, or CJNG.",
      "The violent CJNG\u00a0was one of eight cartels that were designated\u00a0as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the Trump administration in February.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia's brother-in-law is CJNG leader Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, who for years has been sought by the U.S. government.",
      "The State Department also announced Wednesday that it was sanctioning five CJNG leaders, including \"El Mencho,\" as specially designated global terrorists.",
      "Also sanctioned this week was CJNG regional commander Audias Flores Silva, who the State Department said \"controls clandestine laboratories used to produce methamphetamine and other illegal drugs trafficked to the United States.\"",
      "Sanctioned as well was CJNG commander Ricardo Ruiz Velasco, who is the prime suspect in the shooting death last month of 23-year-old Mexican influencer Valeria M\u00e1rquez during a livestream. Velasco and M\u00e1rquez were believed to be in a romantic relationship, the State Department said.",
      "The State Department is offering a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest of \"El Mencho,\" and up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of Silva.",
      "Meanwhile, El Mencho's son-in-law, Cristian Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez Ochoa, appeared in the same courtroom earlier Friday to plead guilty in a separate case to a money laundering conspiracy charge.",
      "Gutierrez Ochoa was arrested toward the end of the Biden administration last year in California, where authorities have said he was living under a bogus name after faking his own death and fleeing Mexico.",
      "Together, the prosecutions reflect the U.S. government's efforts to weaken the brutal Jalisco New Generation cartel that's responsible for importing staggering amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the United States \u2014 and track down its elusive leader, El Mencho.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to turn up the pressure on CJNG and other cartels with the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation, which gives authorities new tools to prosecute those associated with cartels.",
      "\"You can't totally prosecute your way out of the cartel problem, but you can make an actual impact by letting people know that we're going to be enforcing this and showing that Mexico is being cooperative with us and then ultimately trying to get high-level targets to sort of set the organization back,\" Matthew Galeotti, who leads the Justice Department's criminal division, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "President Trump's Justice Department has declared dismantling CJNG and other cartels a top priority, and Galeotti said the U.S. in recent months has seen increased cooperation from Mexican officials. In February, Mexico sent 29 cartel figures \u2014 including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985 \u2014 to the U.S. for prosecution.",
      "The Trump administration has already charged a handful of defendants with terrorism offenses since designating CJNG and seven other Latin American crime organizations as FTOs in February. Galeotti said several additional indictments related to CJNG and other cartels remain under seal.",
      "\"We are taking a division-wide approach to this,\" Galeotti said. \"We've got money laundering prosecutors who are not just focused on the cartels themselves ... but also on financial facilitators. So when we're taking this broad approach ... That's why I think we've had some of the really significant cases that we've had, and we've seen a very significant pipeline.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia pleaded guilty to international cocaine trafficking in 2022. Authorities said he went into hiding in Bolivia in 2015 after leading Los Cuinis alongside his brothers for more than a decade. He was arrested in 2017 under the first Trump administration after traveling to Brazil, and was later extradited to the U.S.",
      "Los Cuinis used \"air, land, sea and under-the-sea methods\" to smuggle drugs bound for the U.S., prosecutors said. In one instance, authorities said Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia invested in a shipment of 4,000 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 roughly 8,818 pounds \u2014 that was packed in a semi-submersible vessel to travel from Colombia to Guatemala. Other methods employed by Los Cuinis include hiding drugs in frozen shark carcasses, prosecutors said. He's also accused of directing the killing of a rival.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia appeared in court wearing an orange jumpsuit and listened to the hearing through an interpreter over headphones. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell sealed part of the hearing, keeping the press and public out of the courtroom while lawyers argued over the sentence. It was not clear why the judge determined it had to be sealed. Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia's lawyer declined to comment after the hearing.",
      "In the other case, Guti\u00e9rrez Ochoa was wanted in Mexico on allegations that he kidnapped two Mexican Navy members in 2021 in the hope of securing the release of El Mencho's wife after she had been arrested by Mexican authorities, prosecutors have said. Authorities have said he faked his own death and fled to the U.S. to avoid Mexican authorities, and that El Mencho told associates he killed Guti\u00e9rrez Ochoa for lying.",
      "Rosalinda Gonzalez, the wife of El Mencho,\u00a0was released from Mexican prison in February.",
      "El Mencho's son, Rub\u00e9n Oseguera \u2014 known as \"El Menchito\" \u2014 was sentenced in March to life in prison after his conviction in Washington's federal court of conspiring to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine for U.S. importation and using a firearm in a drug conspiracy.",

      "The policy, McConnell wrote, \"is arbitrary and capricious in its scope and lacks specificity in how the States are to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for Congressionally appropriated transportation dollars \u2014 grant money that the States rely on to keep their residents safely and efficiently on the road, in the sky, and on the rails.\"",
      "The Rhode Island judge added that \"Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically appropriated for transportation purposes.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

      "Demonstrators crowded into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Trump, marching through downtowns and blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.",
      "Organizers of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Confrontations were isolated.",
      "But one person was transported to a Salt Lake City hospital Saturday night with life-threatening injuries after a shooting during that city's protest, officials said. Salt Lake City police said the shooting was \"possibly associated with the demonstration.\"",
      "Huge, boisterous crowds marched in New York, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, some behind \"no kings\" banners.",
      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight. Police said they found \"No Kings\" fliers and a list of other potential targets in the suspect's vehicle.",
      "In Texas, state legislators received a \"credible threat\" against them ahead of the planned protest at the state capitol building in Austin, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A suspect was later arrested.",
      "In other cities around the country, protests began as scheduled.",
      "Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.",
      "Light rain fell as marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia. They shouted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" as they marched to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they listened to speakers on the steps made famous in the movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building. Portland police said in a release early Sunday that three people were arrested near the ICE facility for \"criminal actions, and not constitutionally protected free speech.\"",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that ramped up last week, with Mr. Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles as some protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Democratic governors called Mr. Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",
      "Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.",
      "\"New Yorkers may have different emotions right now,\" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a briefing on Friday. \"And they have a right to express that, \u00a0but we want to be clear you do not have a right to engage in violence and lawlessness.\"",
      "New York City expected hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to turn out, with multiple protests planned around the area, organizers said.",
      "Though no major demonstration was expected in Washington, D.C., where the\u00a0military parade\u00a0will take place on what is also Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, some protesters gathered Saturday in Lafayette Square, across from the White House.",
      "What is No Kings Day?",
      "The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the\u00a050501 Movement, to support democracy and against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.",
      "Protesters have called for Mr. Trump to be \"dethroned\" as they compare his actions to those of a king and not a democratically elected president.",
      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",
      "Organizers timed the protests to counter the Army's 250th anniversary celebration, which included a military parade involving hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The parade has been estimated to cost between $25 million to $45 million, The Army expected the parade to attract as many as 200,000 people.",
      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",
      "The group says a core principle behind all \"No Kings\" events was a commitment to nonviolent action, and organizers urged participants to seek to de-escalate any confrontation.",
      "Organizers said the No Kings Day of Defiance is expected to be the largest single-day mobilization since Mr. Trump returned to office. They said they were preparing for millions of people to take to the streets across all 50 states.",

      "Nebraska's governor on Friday also signed an emergency proclamation for activating his state's National Guard, a step his office called \"a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"",
      "Organizers say that one march would go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/diplomacy-de-escalate-israel-iran-conflict/",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There's a narrow window to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end before President Trump decides whether to involve the U.S. in the Israeli offensive.",
    "story": [
      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",
      "U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that there are confidential conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, and the potential environmental and health fallout for regional allies from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",
      "In the meantime, the president still has the option of choosing to use military force including the potential of using for the first time in history the MOP or massive ordnance penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb, to destroy the underground nuclear facilities at Fordo.",
      "In theory, Mr. Trump maintains the ability to launch a strike while he's out of town at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday and Saturday, sources said. A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003. But Iran has accumulated a quantity of enriched nuclear fuel that could potentially be matched with an advanced missile or a more rudimentary weapon in short order if the supreme leader ordered it. It remains an open question whether bombing Fordo would trigger Iran's leaders to sprint toward creating a bomb or end the program altogether.",

      "Residents and authorities in southern Mexico are assessing the damage and watching for rising rivers as rain from the remnants of Hurricane Erick doused the region.",
      "Landslides and flooding were an ongoing concern for officials after Erick \u2013 once a Category 4 hurricane\u00a0\u2014 dissipated following landfall early Thursday.",
      "At least two deaths have been confirmed \u2013 a 1-year-old boy who drowned in a swollen river in Guerrero state and a man was electrocuted while helping with debris removal in Oaxaca state, officials said.",
      "Erick came ashore down southern Mexico's Pacific coast Thursday morning as a Category 3 major hurricane. It landed between the resort cities of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido.",
      "Erick had strengthened to a Category 4 storm as it approached the coast, but weakened to a Category 3 storm before making landfall.",
      "Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick churned through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification \u2014 when a storm gains at least 55 kph (35 mph) in 24 hours \u2014 which is about twice the average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.",
      "Authorities reported landslides, blocked highways, downed power lines and some flooding as coastal residents, above all in Acapulco, took the storm seriously with memories of the devastating\u00a0Hurricane Otis in 2023 still fresh in their minds. Erick wiped out power to more than 120,000 customers at one point.",
      "\"It was very strong, very ugly... the entire town is homeless, without clothes, we have no help,\" Francisca Avila, a 45-year-old housewife, told AFP, as she surveyed the loss of most of her belongings.",
      "In Puerto Escondido, fishermen searched for and inspected storm-tossed boats and residents cleared downed trees and other debris. Much of the town of about 30,000 people was left without electricity or cellphone coverage, AFP reported.",
      "The remnants of the storm dissipated Thursday night over the mountains in Michoacan state.",
      "Restaurants, shops and supermarkets gradually reopened in Acapulco, but schools remained closed across Guerrero on Friday as authorities continued to assess damage, clear debris and monitor rising rivers.",
      "\"Many of us were frightened, but now it has passed,\" said Juan Carlos Casta\u00f1eda, a 49-year-old security guard at an Acapulco condominium complex. He said the \"tragedy of Otis marked all of us.\"",
      "Despite the rain, Casta\u00f1eda decided to go out for a walk.",
      "Down the coast in the fishing village of Barra Vieja, the wind-whipped surf battered the shore and heavy rain kept residents sheltered indoors.",

    "summary": "British lawmakers have backed legislation that would legalize assisted dying for adults with six months or less to live.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0After hours of impassioned debate, British lawmakers in the House of Commons voted Friday to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives. The bill passed by 23 votes, with hundreds protesting about the divisive issue outside of parliament, from both sides of the debate.",
      "The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill will now undergo months of scrutiny by the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Britain's Parliament. The lords, who are not elected, can debate, delay and amend the bill, but they have little power to block legislation passed by the elected Members of Parliament in the House of Commons.",
      "The central tenet of the bill is that adults over 18 who are deemed to have less than six months to live could \u2014 after a series of safeguarding checks \u2014 be provided help to end their lives, in the form of fatal drugs that they could self-administer.",
      "In November, British lawmakers gave initial approval to the new law, passing it by 330 votes to 275 \u2014 a wider margin that indicates some members of parliament changed their minds before Friday's vote.",
      "Since the first vote, the original bill proposed by Labour Party lawmaker Kim Leadbeater underwent several changes, including the dropping of a provision that would have required a judge to sign off on any final decision granting a medically assisted death. The current bill requires any request to be approved by two doctors and a panel that includes a social worker, a senior legal figure, and a psychiatrist.",
      "In a debate before the vote on Friday, Leadbeater told parliament about the many stories she had heard from people who witnessed friends and family suffer traumatic deaths.",
      "\"Not supporting the bill today is not a neutral act. It is a vote for the status quo,\" she said, according to The Associated Press. \"And it fills me with despair to think MPs [Members of Parliament] could be here in another 10 years' time hearing the same stories.\"",
      "Leadbeater and other supporters of the bill argue that people with terminal diagnoses should have the right to choose whether to continue living. They have cited stories of people taking their own lives in secret because no-one could legally help them.",
      "They also argue that it isn't fair that people with enough money can currently seek life-ending care by traveling to Switzerland. More than 500 Britons have ended their lives in Switzerland, where foreigners can opt for an assisted death.",
      "Opponents argue that elderly or disabled people could be manipulated \u2014 overtly or covertly \u2014 into ending their lives, to save money or to relieve a perceived burden on loved ones. Others say better end-of-life and health care would be a better alternative.",
      "Outside parliament on Friday, protesters faced off with contrasting slogans. Some wore clothes bearing the phrase: \"Campaign for Dignity in Dying,\" while opponents held banners calling the U.K.'s state-run National Health Service, the \"National Suicide Service.\"",
      "The vote paves the way for what could be one of the biggest changes in social policy in the U.K. since the partial legalization of abortion in 1967.",
      "If the bill passes the House of Lords, it is expected to take another four years to be fully implemented.",

    "summary": "American cyclist Ian Andersen said Iranians' warm welcome and hospitality changed abruptly when Israel started bombing.",
    "story": [
      "Popping a champagne bottle on Portugal's Atlantic coast in February, 32-year-old American Ian Andersen\u00a0set out to fulfill his dream of biking across all seven continents of the world. He planned to ride for 10 months, covering roughly 10,000 miles to reach his final destination of Japan.",
      "He did not plan, however, for Israel to launch a war on Iran.",
      "As he crossed into Iran on June 1, Andersen was filled with excitement, and anxiety.",
      "\"I was quite nervous. I was like, okay, now we're getting into some uncharted territory here,\" he told CBS News on Thursday from a hotel room in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku. \"But I was immediately put at ease with so many positive experiences from people that I met on the road\u2026 and hospitality, generosity.\"",
      "He said he was \"surprised daily\" by kind, curious Iranians inviting him for tea or offering him food, even trying to pay for his meal at a restaurant.",
      "On June 13, that changed, when Israel started bombing Iran's nuclear and military sites.",
      "\"Not any outward hostility, but I just kind of read people's body language and their facial expressions,\" said Andersen. \"And I knew I was in quite a bit of danger, because people were seeing Israel and the U.S. as being quite tied together at that point, as the bombs kept falling and the missiles kept striking.\"",
      "He and his local Iranian guide, Reza, decided to hunker down at a guesthouse about 45 miles north of Tehran, in a village called Harijan, for two days.",
      "Reza, who Andersen said had become his friend, advised him to avoid telling people he was American, and to avoid talking to people at all if possible. But he said he slipped up, revealing his nationality to some local travelers who joined them at the hotel.",
      "\"They weren't happy about the fact that they were having to share a hotel with 'that American' that was there,\" said Andersen.",
      "On June 15, Andersen heard an Israeli bomb explode in the distance. That same day he received an email from the U.S. State Department, advising him of options for Americans wishing to leave Iran, based on their current locations. He decided his best bet was an eight hour drive north, around the Caspian Sea, to reach Azerbaijan.",
      "He and Reza were quickly caught up in a steady flow of dense traffic, as residents streamed out of Tehran. They passed gas stations with long lines of cars, and many military checkpoints.",
      "\"It was quite harrowing,\" he said. \"The idea of maybe being pulled over at one of the military checkpoints.\"",
      "\"Reza, my guide, had told me that he can no longer protect me, and that really rattled me, right? Cause, he's my guide. He's my Iranian guide, and very stable, sturdy, dependable guy. And he's like, 'All right, this is it. Like, you're in quite a bit of danger here. If we're stopped and the police suspect you of something, there's nothing I can do.'\"",
      "Andersen said he became \"more and more at ease as we got closer,\" and they eventually made it without incident to Iran's border with Azerbaijan.",
      "But the most nerve-wracking part of that final day was about to begin, as he was interviewed not once, but twice by Iranian officials \u2014 normal border police and then by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.",
      "For the second interview, he was pulled out of a crowd and taken into the backroom of a storage closet in a makeshift army barracks.",
      "\"That's where I was like, 'Okay, I've got a 50-50 chance of being taken either as a bargaining chip or for further questioning,'\" he said. \"Actually, the interview was like, less than a minute.\"",
      "\"I walked out back into the night to get my bicycle and then actually enter Azerbaijan, and I half expected them to call me back. I was like, 'Something's wrong here. Um, why, why was this so easy?' But they didn't, and I was able to enter Azerbaijan.\"",
      "Clear of Iran's internet firewall, he was able to message his family in the U.S. before he checked into the first hotel he could find, and then sleep for 12 hours in relief and exhaustion.",
      "Now safe as the Israel-Iran conflict drags on, Andersen said he thinks a lot about the possible spillover effect for anyone with a U.S. passport living and traveling overseas.",
      "He said he registered his travel itinerary with the U.S. State Department's STEP program, which sends country-specific notifications and updates based on a traveler's movements. It's how he knew to head for Azerbaijan, and he urges all Americans traveling abroad to do the same.",
      "Andersen also said if it were not for his Iranian guide, he might not have made it out of the country. He hopes to raise money for Reza and his family, who are still in Iran.",
      "He also intends to carry on with his bike ride to Japan, to fulfil his dream of cycling all of the world's continents.",

To reach their targets, Israeli warplanes must cover about 1,000 miles, traversing as many as three countries, including Iraq, which sits right on Iran's western border. For decades, Iranian groups opposed to the Islamic Republic's theocratic rulers have organized in exile across the border in Iraq, including ethnic Kurdish factions that have become well organized, and armed.",
      "Kawsar Fattahi is a leader in one of the opposition parties that's been outlawed in Iran and labelled a terrorist organization by the authorities in Tehran.",
      "\"The regime is weakening day by day,\" she told CBS News. Fattahi believes the government led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could collapse under the pressure of the Israeli assault. If it does, she said it would be just deserts for the Islamic hardliners who have ruled the nation with an iron fist for almost half a century.",
      "\"Okay, the war is bad. People are dying. But it's still not that much killing [as] the Iranian regime itself do,\" she told CBS News, arguing that Iran's leaders have killed more Iranians themselves over the decades than the Israelis have with a week of blistering warfare. Iranian officials have only acknowledged about 220 deaths from Israel's strikes, but the Washington-based Human Rights Activists in Iran group, which relies on a network of sources in the country, says the death toll is really over 650, with more than 2,000 others wounded.",
      "Ayatollah Khamanei, the 86-year-old who's ruled the nation of 90 million people for nearly four decades, is only Iran's second supreme leader since the 1979 revolution that brought the conservative, deeply anti-American Islamic Republic to power. The revolution toppled a pro-Western, but deeply corrupt and repressive royal family which had led Iran to a secular and relatively prosperous nation in the region.",
      "Many older Iranians can still remember those pre-revolution days, and many younger Iranians, even with their censored view of the outside world, crave the freedoms that the regime has brutally stifled.",
      "The regime is deeply unpopular with many Iranians, and that has manifested in mass protests on several occasions over the last decade, including those calling for an end to forced Islamic dress codes and other restrictions on women. The demonstrations have been met with deadly force.",
      "Iranian opposition wants support, but not U.S. \"boots on the ground\"",

      "\"Brave people of Iran, your light will defeat the darkness,\" he urged last week after launching the attacks.",
      "Due to the war, the \"Iranian regime have lost their control to suppress people, because a lot the leadership of IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] have been killed,\" she said. \"Now the power of suppression are weakening inside Iran, so it can lead people to come street again.\"",
      "But Fattahi told CBS News that Iranians do not want Israel, or the U.S., to engineer regime change in Tehran. She said that while American airstrikes might help further weaken the government, Iranians want to topple their leaders \u2014 and decide who replaces them \u2014 on their own.",
      "\"We do not want their boots on the ground, obviously,\" she said. \"We don't want [a] made-up state.\"",
      "What kind of support do Fattahi and her group want from the world's biggest military, then?",
      "\"Don't compromise with the regime, because they are killing people,\" she said. \"World would be a better place without the Iranian regime, for all of us.\"",
      "She said Iranians, with enough support from the international community, are ready and willing to build their own new government, and \"we want a democratic Iran. We want a secular Iran.\"",
      "She said her party was already having discussions with U.S. officials.",

      "Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last royal leader, the shah who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has also lived for years in exile, and he has also been an outspoken critic of the ayatollah. Pahlavi, who lives in the Washington D.C. area, has indicated in interviews this week that he wants to lead a political transition, and that he's been in discussions already about his country's future.",
      "\"Informed sources inside the country who have been in contact with me say that the regime's command and coordination structures are breaking down at a remarkable pace,\" Pahlavi said in a message posted on social media Friday. \"On the other hand, the international community is realizing that the Islamic Republic has no future and that our discussions about a post-Islamic Republic Iran have begun, which could accelerate and facilitate the regime's fall.\"",
      "It remains unclear how much support the son of the ousted shah, whose family is seen as being close to the U.S. and Israel \u2014 or the exiled Kurdish groups \u2014 might actually garner among Iranians. It's also unclear how many Iranians still in the country might feel confident enough to take to the streets again, or when that point could be reached, given how swiftly and violently previous popular uprisings have been put down.",
      "Any U.S. military involvement in the offensive against the regime could bring that point closer, but Khamenei has warned that such a move would be met with \"irreparable damage\" for the U.S.",

      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Mr. Trump was weighing a strike on Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. Israel has not conducted any known strikes on Fordo since it began bombing Iranian nuclear and military targets late last week.",
      "Trump's decision",
      "Mr. Trump is willing to get the U.S. involved if that's what it takes to knock out the site, sources said. As of Thursday, he was still reviewing his options and has not made a firm decision either way. He has discussed the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of the U.S. military infrastructure needed for a strike was in place or how much time it would take to move assets into position.",
      "One option Mr. Trump has considered is that Iran could disable Fordo on its own, if its leaders so choose, two of the sources said.",
      "David Lammy, the foreign secretary of the U.K., flew to Washington to meet Thursday with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, CBS News learned, with active diplomacy underway to find an off-ramp in the conflict and make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Iran. London maintains an embassy in Tehran, giving the U.K. visibility that the U.S. does not have in the Iranian capital.",
      "\"Now is the time to put a stop to the grave scenes in the Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one,\" Lammy said in a statement following his meetings with Trump officials.",
      "Mr. Trump is aware of the diplomatic effort being undertaken, with Lammy, the foreign ministers of Germany, France and the high representative of the European Union set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva on Friday.",
      "The conversation there may help ascertain whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S., not just the European nations, which is something Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Mr. Trump has viewed intelligence reports indicating the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, has said in closed-door settings that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing nuclear weapons, according to multiple sources.",
      "Ratcliffe has said that claiming Iran isn't close would be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard line don't want to score a touchdown, one U.S. official said.",
      "Congressional committees that have been briefed by senior CIA analysts have been told the intelligence community's view remains that no order to weaponize has been given by the supreme leader and that Iran has not restarted research on a delivery mechanism for a nuclear bomb.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that \"so far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "\"They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\" he told reporters. \"If there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it's based upon fact and not political influence.\"",
      "\"Things change, especially with war\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not made a final decision on whether to strike Iran.",
      "\"I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, because things change, especially with war,\" he said.",
      "\"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,\" he said earlier in the day, adding that he'd like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program.",
      "Iran \u2014 which has long insisted the program exists solely for peaceful purposes \u2014 said Wednesday it \"does NOT negotiate under duress,\" and said it would \"respond to any threat with a counter-threat.\"",
      "Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a Pentagon official briefed on the matter.",
      "Israel began striking Iran last Friday morning. The Trump administration has said publicly it is not participating in the offensive strikes, though CBS News previously reported the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.",
      "In recent days, Mr. Trump has not ruled out the idea of joining Israel's campaign, saying on Truth Social his \"patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "The president said Tuesday the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. On Sunday, CBS News reported Mr. Trump had opposed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.",
      "Next steps in possible negotiations",
      "Two diplomatic sources indicated to CBS News that Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, had offered to host potential direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran should Tehran choose that path. At this point, there are no direct US-Iran talks scheduled, though European allies are trying to help coordinate.",
      "On Thursday, the Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rubio had told him that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts. A French diplomat said that Rubio spoke by phone with his French counterpart, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, and conveyed that the U.S. was ready for \"direct contact with the Iranians at any time.\" Barrot and Rubio are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations in order to coordinate.",
      "Amidst the chaos inside Iran following the Israeli strikes and the killing of top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials, it is not clear just what Araghchi's marching orders will be when he arrives in Geneva, nor how functional the Iranian government itself is at this moment.",
      "Sources in the region indicated that connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete. The cyber attacks that have paralyzed the banking system itself underscore the internal disruption, and as of Thursday multiple diplomats acknowledged it all made it more difficult to arrange for in person talks with Araghchi   in the first place. Iranian state news announced Araghchi   is expected to transit on to Turkey on June 20.",
      "One diplomatic source indicated that the ongoing Israeli assault may also make the supreme leader fearful to communicate given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him.",
      "Mr. Trump has been frustrated in recent weeks that while Iran shows up to the negotiating table, its leaders have not shown a willingness to negotiate terms. A U.S. official familiar with the efforts told News CBS that Iran sat for two weeks on the most recent Witkoff proposal presented by the U.S. without directly declining or accepting its terms. Instead Iranian leadership issued press statements, but the negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement left the Trump administration in doubt over whether Iran was engaging in good faith negotiations, or simply running out the proverbial clock.",
      "Netanyahu has publicly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump, and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes but also did not explicitly tell Netanyahu to go forward. Diplomatic sources acknowledged to CBS News that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel, and uncertain over whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was all a ruse to justify the military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "A U.S. official insisted to CBS News Thursday evening that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine as was his aversion to getting the U.S. military drawn into a Middle East war, especially without a clear sense of what will come next should the Iranian regime collapse. U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that behind closed doors there are conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, as well as environmental and health impacts for allies in surrounding areas that could result from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",

      "Israel's Home Front Command said in a statement posted online that one of the missiles launched by Iran on Thursday was a \"dispersal munition,\" a missile designed to release about 20 smaller bombs at an altitude of roughly four miles as it nears a target, inflicting potential damage on the ground across a radius of about five miles. It said each of the small bombs released could cause damage similar to that of a short-range rocket.",

      "Israel vows to hold Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"accountable\"",
      "Iran said the primary target of the attack that hit the Soroka Hospital was an Israeli military intelligence site, not the health facility, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack and vowed a response, saying: \"We will exact the full price from the tyrants in Tehran.\"",

      "The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Already, Israel's campaign has targeted Iran's uranium enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran and a nuclear site in Isfahan.",
      "Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon.",
      "Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "In 2019, Iran started up the heavy water reactor's secondary circuit, which at the time didn't violate Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "Britain at the time was helping Iran redesign the Arak reactor to limit the amount of plutonium it produces, stepping in for the U.S., which had withdrawn from the project after President Trump's decision in 2018 to unilaterally pull America out of the nuclear deal.",
      "The IAEA has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. IAEA inspectors reportedly last visited Arak on May 14.",
      "Due to restrictions Iran imposed on inspectors, the IAEA has said it has lost \"continuity of knowledge\" about Iran's heavy water production -- meaning it couldn't absolutely verify Tehran's production and stockpile.",
      "As part of negotiations around the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to sell off its heavy water to the West to remain in compliance with the accord's terms. Even the U.S. purchased some 32 tons of heavy water for over $8 million in one deal. That was one issue that drew criticism from the pact's opponents.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-iran-war-fordo-nuclear-site/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Iran has long been suspected of hiding work toward a nuclear weapon at its underground Fordo enrichment site.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, the one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Both sit south of Tehran in central Iran, but Fordo has long been the Iranian nuclear facility of most concern to international monitors and experts.",
      "Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability. There have been no reported Israeli strikes on the Fordo enrichment facility.",
      "As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\"",
      "Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed that the country had intelligence indicating the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters early Tuesday morning, President Trump appeared to have been swayed. Asked about the assessment Gabbard delivered in March, he said: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Iran's leaders have always denied any interest in building a nuclear weapon, insisting the program is for civilian purposes. But if that's obfuscation, as Israel insists, and the Iranians are close to a nuclear weapons capability, more than a decade of analysis of Iran's nuclear facilities by experts around the world suggests Fordo would be central to those efforts.",
      "Mr. Trump has been briefed on both the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The White House said Thursday that he expects to make a decision within two weeks. \"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement.",
      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "Because of its location deep within a mountain, experts believe Israel's best chance at destroying the facility could lie with a U.S.-produced \"bunker-buster\" bomb\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP \u2014 a bomb is so heavy that it could only be dropped by an American B-2 Bomber. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked about the possibility at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's being reported that the president is being asked to consider providing the bunker-buster bomb that is required to be carried only by the B-2 Bomber and would require a U.S. pilot,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat of New Hampshire, pressing Hegseth on whether he had been asked to provide the president with options for striking the Middle East. He declined to answer.",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

[Diddy] brought [escorts] in. That's one way to prove a predicate. You have to prove two of them.

      "\"She has a healthy-looking distribution of fat contributing to this new look, which could potentially be the effect of a fat transfer in addition to a facelift.\"",

      "Dr. Jonathan Kaplan, a board-certified plastic surgeon with Pacific Heights Plastic Surgery in San Francisco, agreed that Jenner has gotten an \"incredible result\" from what \"appears to be\" a deep plane facelift.",
      "Traditional vs. deep plane facelift",
      "With a standard or traditional facelift \u2014 also known as a SMAS facelift, or a Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System facelift \u2014 the surgeon makes incisions behind the hairline and around the front of the ear, lifting and tightening the deeper tissues and muscles and then removing excess skin.",

      "It\u2019s important to choose a facelift that is right for the patient and that falls within the surgeon\u2019s expertise, Davis noted.",
      "\"In those patients who have had multiple facelifts in the past, it could be wise to perform a simpler SMAS facelift with less dissection, as the tissues have been manipulated in the past,\" he advised.",
      "Risks and recovery",
      "Any elective or non-elective surgery carries some degree of risk, experts agree.",
      "\"In any given surgery, there is a risk of infection, nerve damage, or bruising and swelling,\" Davis cautioned. \"These are minimized based on the surgeon's experience and the frequency with which they perform the procedure.\"",
      "THIS DAILY BEAUTY ROUTINE COULD BE RUINING YOUR HAIR, EXPERTS WARN",
      "It is important that the surgeon goes over these risks with the patient in person, according to Davis.",

      "\"A deep plane facelift involves a wider dissection under the structural elements of the face, which then allows the surgeon to reset a greater proportion of facial tissues,\" a surgeon said. (iStock)",

      "Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, to generate an image or let artificial intelligence summarize your email, something big is happening behind the scenes. Not on your device, but in sprawling data centers filled with servers, GPUs and cooling systems that require massive amounts of electricity.",
      "The modern AI boom is pushing our power grid to its limits. ChatGPT alone processes roughly 1 billion queries per day, each requiring data center resources far beyond what\u2019s on your device.",
      "In fact, the energy needed to support artificial intelligence is rising so quickly that it has already delayed the retirement of several coal plants in the U.S., with more delays expected. Some experts warn that the AI arms race is outpacing the infrastructure meant to support it. Others argue it could spark long-overdue clean energy innovation.",
      "AI isn't just reshaping apps and search engines. It's also reshaping how we build, fuel and regulate the digital world. The race to scale up AI capabilities is accelerating faster than most infrastructure can handle, and energy is becoming the next major bottleneck.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",
      "HOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world\u2019s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand.

      "This kind of malware is designed for scale. It targets large groups, works across different regions and updates fast. It can pretend to be a bank, a shopping app or even something harmless like a browser update. The scary part is how normal it all looks. People are not expecting something this malicious to hide inside something that looks like a gift.",
      "The creators of Crocodilus understand how people think and act online. They are using that knowledge to build tools that work quietly and effectively. And they are not working alone. This kind of operation likely involves a network of developers, advertisers and distributors all working together.",

      "7 expert tips to protect your Android from Crocodilus malware",
      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "How does ANYmal-D play badminton with humans?",
      "Badminton is a game that requires quick footwork, fast reactions, and precise hand-eye coordination. To give a robot a chance on the court, the\u00a0ETH Zurich team equipped ANYmal-D with four legs for stability and agility, a dynamic arm to swing the racket, and a stereo camera to track the shuttlecock. The robot uses a reinforcement learning-based controller, which allows it to predict and react to the shuttlecock's movement in real-time. ANYmal-D can move around the court, adjust its posture, and time its swings, keeping rallies going with human players for up to 10 shots.",
      "NO TENNIS PARTNER? NO WORRIES WITH THIS AI ROBOT",
      "The technology behind ANYmal-D's badminton skills",
      "ANYmal-D's stereo camera serves as its eyes, constantly monitoring the shuttlecock. The robot uses a \"perception noise model\" to compare what it sees with data from its training, helping it track the shuttlecock even when it moves unpredictably. The robot can pitch its body to keep the shuttlecock in view, mimicking how a human player might lean in for a tricky shot.",

      "Coordinating legs and an arm is tough for any robot.

      "Getting the robot's legs and arm to work together smoothly is a major challenge. Most robots handle these tasks separately, but this limits agility.

On average, it took about 0.357 seconds to process the shuttlecock's trajectory after a human hit, leaving just over half a second to get into position and make the shot.

To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers.

Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts. If you're screen-sharing during a call, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends.",

      "2. Smarter scam detection in Google Messages",
      "Android's AI-powered\u00a0Scam Detection in Google Messages and Phone by Google is now even more intelligent. It can identify suspicious conversation patterns in real-time and warn you before you fall victim to a scam. This protection covers a wide range of scams, including toll road and billing fee scams, cryptocurrency scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, tech support scams, and more. All message analysis happens on your device, so your conversations stay private.",
      "Availability can vary depending on your device, region, and carrier. If you don't see these features yet, make sure your\u00a0app is updated and keep an eye out as Google continues to expand support to more users worldwide.",

      "3. Fighting fraud and impersonation with Key Verifier",
      "To help protect you from scammers who try to impersonate someone you know, Android is rolling out Key Verifier in Google Messages. This feature lets you and your contact verify each other's identity using public encryption keys, either by scanning a QR code or comparing numbers. If a contact's verification status changes, like after a SIM swap, you'll see a warning, giving you extra confidence that you're talking to the right person.",

      "If you've ever used Android's\u00a0Find My Device to track down a lost phone or set of keys, you know how helpful it can be. Now, Find My Device is evolving into\u00a0Find Hub, making it easier to keep track of your devices, family, and friends all in one place, with more partner brands joining the network.",
      "Find Hub is also becoming more personalized. Whether you want built-in luggage tracking from\u00a0July and\u00a0Mokobara, ski protection with\u00a0Peak integration, or Disney-themed Bluetooth tags from Pixbee, there are options to suit different needs. Soon, tags that are enabled with ultra-wideband, starting with moto tag, will provide improved nearby location tracking.",
      "Later this year, Find Hub will include satellite connectivity, allowing you to stay connected with friends and family even when cellular service is unavailable. For travelers, new partnerships with airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and Singapore Airlines will let you share your Bluetooth tag's location directly with these airlines. This should make recovering lost luggage easier and less stressful.",

      "Regularly review your privacy settings: Make sure you're comfortable with what you're sharing. Adjust settings to limit data sharing and enhance your privacy whenever possible.",
      "Consider a personal data removal service: Scammers often start by gathering information about you from public records and data broker sites.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana. Scammers have created a fraudulent Venmo account that closely mimics the legitimate Venmo handle of the cancer nonprofit organization. They are using this fake account to trick well-meaning donors into sending money, believing they are supporting the real charity.",

      "Instead of helping, Venmo routed Rinaldi through generic FAQs and legal disclaimers. Even after he was connected with a live support agent, the responses were standard scripts.

Take a known nonprofit, tweak the username slightly, and ride the momentum of goodwill. By the time anyone catches on, the money is gone and the damage is done.",
      "The incident involving MPCS is not an isolated case. In December 2024, Final Victory Animal Rescue, a nonprofit based in South Carolina,\u00a0discovered a Venmo account impersonating the organization and collecting donations intended for the real charity.

      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",

These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details.

      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000.

      "Just ask \"Pamela,\" who wrote to us: \"I thought I couldn't be scammed, but I almost was.\"",

      "Facebook scam warning: How Pamela almost fell for a tech support hoax",
      "\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",

      "Pamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.",
      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

Also, install and update strong antivirus software.Protect all your devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones, with strong antivirus software.

      "Use a personal data removal service to clean up your online footprint",
      "Scammers often scour the internet for your personal information. Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts. By sharing experiences and staying informed, we strengthen our community's defense against cybercrime.",

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",

      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.",
      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",

      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",

      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

      "As tensions rise about who is behind the violent anti-ICE riots, a California-based company that specializes in providing on-demand crowds for protests says there are indicators to spot the difference between hired demonstrators and normal crowds.",
      "\"We receive inquiries regarding practically every major social cause imaginable, and the anti-ICE demonstrations are no exception,\" Adam Swart, the CEO and founder of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital. \"The fact that we receive requests does not mean we take them, in many cases because the budget does not match the ambition.\"",
      "Swart added that they have received \"numerous high budget requests\" regarding the anti-ICE demonstrations, but declined those offers due to the fact \"that they do not want to get close to any form of illegal activity, including violence, vandalism or blocking off roads without a permit.\"",
      "Swart, who started Crowds on Demand in 2012 when he was a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to \"change how advocacy is done,\" shared how they support causes and how to spot if these protests are tied to other companies and organizations.",

      "\"Now what you're seeing from the agitators should not be logged in with the broader protest movement, and that is because there is a group of agitators who attach themselves to every cause and use that cause as an excuse to loot, to be violent, and to create disruption,\" Swart said.",
      "\"They do not care about those causes, they merely care about looting and destruction. These are pirates. These are psychopaths, and their behavior should not be tolerated, and their actions should not be used to delegitimize peaceful demonstrators.\"",
      "Swart said that some of these groups have informants inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "\"Activist groups are (likely) receiving tipoffs about ICE raid locations, allowing them to stage protests before law enforcement even arrives,\" Swart shared.",
      "\"I strongly believe that there are ICE informants who are providing information to demonstrators about the locations of the raids. The reason why I believe that is that there were hundreds of demonstrators that showed up with just a few minutes' notice at the locations of the raids. That is difficult to do,\" he continued.",
      "Swart said this is all speculation on his part, and he has no specific information on how the riots might be funded.",
      "\"While I don't have direct information that the protesters are being paid, I strongly believe that many of the protesters are being compensated,\" he explained. \"How do I know this? Because when you can gather hundreds of people at the wee hours of the morning or the late hours of night with zero notice with just a text message within a 10-minute period, that sounds a lot more like a rapid reaction force than a group of passionate demonstrators.\"",
      "Swart said to also look out for legal payouts that are \"disguised as support.\"",

      "Tactical gear is a red flag",
      "Swart said the most important factor to determine whether these rioters are being funded is the use of tactical gear.",
      "\"Another tip that these guys are funded is the fact that they have tactical gear. Tactical gear is extremely expensive and the fact they're passing out hundreds of tactical gear uniforms is an indication that there's some money. Who is funding these groups?\" Swart questioned.",

      "As Israel\u2019s battle to take out Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities continues, Iran\u2019s most heavily-protected nuclear facility at Fordow, two hours from Tehran, remains intact.",
      "Many military analysts believe that a two-ton precision bunker buster developed by and in sole possession of the U.S. is the only means of eliminating the Fordow site, which some claim may be capable of producing a nuclear warhead in as little as two to three days.",
      "Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how Israel or the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat.",
      "IN IRAN\u2019S \u2018FOREVER WAR\u2019 AGAINST THE US, REGIME HAS TARGETED, KILLED AMERICANS WORLDWIDE",
      "Illustration showing how a GBU-57 Bunker Buster is deployed. (Fox News\u00a0)",
      "Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to \"penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes\" underground. The explosion may either take out the target fully, or \"collapse the structure\" around the target \"without necessarily obliterating it,\" he explained.",
      "Bunker busters come in multiple weight classes. Israel possesses 2,000- and 5,000-pound varieties. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordinance Penetrator (MOP).",
      "Developed under President George W. Bush, Ruhe says the MOP was \"designed specifically\" for targets like Fordow, where nuclear sites or command and control bunkers are hidden far underground.",
      "Two separate bombs are dropped by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. (Fox News)",
      "Ruhe said that the number of munitions required to target Fordow depends on the depth of the facility. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies states that Fordow\u2019s facility is between 60 and 90 meters (196 to 295 feet) below ground. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi told The Financial Times last week that the facility reaches 800 meters underground.",
      "Ruhe said Grossi, who has been to the Fordow facility, may have been \"trying to message, \u2018hey, military action is not the solution here.\u2019\"",

      "The illustration shows the first bomb exploding and creating a hole. (Fox News)",
      "The MOP is said to have a penetration depth of 200 feet. Ruhe said that given Fordow\u2019s distance underground and the difficulty of penetrating the rocky mountainside the site is dug into, the U.S. would likely use a technique called burrowing, in which a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber would \"drop several MOPs in succession, one after the other.\"",
      "Fordow poses a unique target. Ruhe said that pilots have to take into account the facility\u2019s multiple, narrow exit tunnels, and achieve the right angle of impact to penetrate the ground.",
      "Though Israeli air dominance over Iran has eliminated the need for stealth air assets, Ruhe believes the stealth B-2 would be the only tool adequate for delivering the MOPs. Ruhe said timing constraints make the use of B-52 bombers \"not relevant.\"",
      "Additionally, Ruhe explained that talk of loaning B-2 bombers to the Israeli Air Force is \"a dangerous distraction.\" Not only is there \"0.0% chance\" that the U.S. would give out this strategic capability, but Ruhe says training Israeli pilots to fly the B-2 would take several months.",
      "A second bomb follows into the hole and explodes, causing more damage. (Fox News)",

      "Given that Israel is \"very tactically inventive\" and \"very good at maximizing the capabilities they do have,\" Ruhe says that Israel could achieve its goals at Fordow without the MOP.",
      "Not only did Ruhe offer the unlikely but not impossible scenario where Israel might \"storm the site in a commando raid,\" but he said that Israel could use F-15s, escorted by F-35s, to deliver multiple 5,000-pound bunker busters over Fordow, utilizing the same burrowing tactic the U.S. would likely employ.",

      "Such a strike, he admitted, would \"achieve a more limited definition of success\" than the MOP could.",
      "The U.S. and Israel are likely to have different goals in targeting Fordow, Ruhe said. \"Americans tend to think of obliterating targets,\" Ruhe said, whereas Israel would \"probably be fine with saying they knocked back the operations there by a year or so.\"",
      "Ruhe estimates that the bunker busters may not completely destroy the facility, but that it may be considered a success if it were to knock out the power source to Iranian centrifuges, or making \"the air too polluted\" for centrifuges to operate.",

    "summary": "Proposed cuts to health insurance programs in the budget bill being pushed through Congress by President Donald Trump could put hundreds of thousands of health care jobs at risk \u2014 jeopardizing one of the few notably strong areas of the U.S. job market.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to health insurance programs in the budget bill being pushed through Congress by President Donald Trump could put hundreds of thousands of health care jobs at risk \u2014 jeopardizing one of the few notably strong areas of the U.S. job market.",
      "Congressional Republicans are advancing a budget plan that would cause nearly 8 million people on Medicaid to lose their health insurance coverage, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, with an additional 2 million people  to lose coverage through the Affordable Care Act if Congress remains on track to let health insurance tax subsidies expire at the end of the year.",
      "Less funding for Medicaid and fewer people with health insurance would mean a drop-off in doctor\u2019s office visits, prescription refills and medical procedures \u2014 and, as a result, fewer workers needed to support those types of services. It could lead to the loss of nearly 500,000 health care jobs over the next decade, according to an analysis by George Washington University and the Commonwealth Fund. The expiration of the ACA tax subsidies, which were enacted in 2021, would result in the loss of an additional 140,000 jobs, a separate analysis from George Washington University found.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, health centers will close, pharmacies in some parts of the country will close because they will lose revenue,\u201d said Leighton Ku, director for the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, who worked on the analyses. \u201cThere are going to be job losses, and we\u2019re talking about middle class jobs being lost.\u201d",
      "That would be a blow to one of the strongest, steadiest areas of the job market in recent years. Health care accounted for nearly half of the jobs added in the U.S. in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, around half of the 2.2 million jobs added to the economy were in health care-related sectors, according to an analysis by S&P Global. That has helped offset job cuts and stagnant growth in other sectors of the labor market, like retail and manufacturing.",
      "\u201cRight now, a lot of what is driving these positive headline numbers and bolstering the labor market is the health care sector,\u201d said Allison Shrivastava, an economist with job listing site Indeed.com. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been a constant. The health care sector has been a pretty big mainstay as the rest of the labor market has cooled.\u201d",
      "The health insurance provisions are part of a broader spending bill that has passed the House and is currently making its way through the Senate. The legislation, which Republicans have dubbed the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" would cut around $800 billion from Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled, in order to help offset some of the $4 trillion in tax cut extensions in the bill for individuals and corporations.",
      "A version of the bill currently in the Senate, which plans to start voting on the legislation next week, would go even further in reducing spending on Medicaid, by including a provision to limit states\u2019 use of taxes on hospitals and other health care providers that help states fund their share of the Medicaid program.",
      "The cuts would take a particular toll on health care providers in rural areas, where patients are more likely to be insured through Medicaid than those in metro areas. Researchers at Georgetown University found that 40% of children in small and rural towns receive their health insurance from Medicaid.",
      "Already, one-third of all rural hospitals in the country are at risk of closing because of financial difficulties, according to a report this month from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.",
      "Also at risk are Community Health Centers, which employ more than 300,000 workers and receive a portion of their funding from the federal government. Those centers, which serve at least 32 million mostly lower-income patients a year, get about 40% of their revenue from Medicaid.",
      "\u201cOur health centers operate on razor-thin margins, so any kind of disruption in payments or reimbursements, even for a short time, can have a significant impact,\u201d said Joe Dunn, chief policy officer for the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cAbout 40% of health centers are in rural America, and oftentimes they are the only primary care in that community. We have health centers in towns of a few hundred people, and there may not be any other kind of health care network there.\u201d",
      "Absent any policy changes from Congress, the health care sector had appeared to be on track for continued growth \u2014 and largely isolated from wider concerns about tariffs and an economic slowdown. The number of job postings for doctors and surgeons on Indeed.com are about 90% higher than their pre-pandemic levels, listings for home health aides are up 46%, and openings for nurses are up 16%, Shrivastava said.",
      "Health care job postings on ZipRecruiter.com represent 27% of all active job listings and health care postings are beginning to make up a larger share of new job postings, according to data from ZipRecruiter.",
      "A loss of that hiring momentum from funding cuts would leave one less positive driver for the job market.",
      "\u201cRight now, the labor market as a whole is arguably in a stagnant position,\u201d said Shrivastava. \u201cPeople are not wanting to leave their jobs, they\u2019re nervous about whether or not they\u2019ll be able to find another job, and companies aren\u2019t really looking to hire. Health care has been the exception to that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday further blocked the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students while giving those students additional legal protections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs issued the preliminary injunction after having granted a temporary restraining order against the federal government this month.",
      "The injunction holds that the administration is blocked from yanking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which was based on a May 22 revocation notice the Department of Homeland Security sent to Harvard administrators.",
      "In her decision, Burroughs directed the government to \u201cimmediately\u201d prepare guidance to alert Trump administration officials to disregard that notice and to restore \u201cevery visa holder and applicant to the position that individual would have been absent such Revocation Notice.\u201d",
      "It also says the student visa holders should not be denied entry to the country as a result of the revocation.",
      "The government must \"file a status report within 72 hours of entry of this Order describing the steps taken to ensure compliance with this Order and certifying compliance with its requirements,\" Burroughs wrote.",
      "Preliminary injunctions can be appealed, which the Justice Department is likely to do.",
      "The Justice Department and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The May letter from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration was revoking Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll international students in part because it had been \"perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies.\"",
      "Harvard denied the allegations and called Noem's actions \"unlawful and unwarranted.\"",
      "Trump said in a presidential proclamation this month that he would deny visas to foreign students who were looking to come to the United States to attend Harvard. The school hit back, amending its May lawsuit and asking the court to halt enforcement of the proclamation, which Burroughs swiftly granted.",
      "At a hearing on the injunction, Ian Heath Gershenger, an attorney for the university, accused the administration of \u201cusing international students as pawns\u201d and singling out Harvard. Justice Department attorneys focused on the administration's national security concerns, saying they did not trust Harvard to vet thousands of international students.",
      "An attorney for the Trump administration previously said that it does not have the same concerns in regard to other schools but that that could change.",
      "The revocation was one of the latest moves the administration has taken against Harvard after the school refused to adhere to a set of demands issued by the administration\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. Those demands included making sweeping reforms to policies about whom the university can hire and admit and subjecting the ideologies of faculty members to an audit approved by the government.",
      "In April, the task force announced it would cut more than $2 billion in grants after the school rejected its demands, which included restricting the acceptance of international students who are \u201chostile to the American values and institutions.\u201d",
      "Harvard quickly sued the administration and accused it of seeking \u201cunprecedented and improper\u201d control of the school. As tensions escalated, the administration weeks later further asked all federal agencies to end their contracts with Harvard \u2014 an amount totaling $100 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s targeting of the prestigious university has drawn backlash from critics and free speech advocates, as well as support for the school from fellow institutions.",
      "Two dozen universities filed an amicus brief in support of the school this month, arguing that the funding freeze would affect more than just Harvard because of the interconnectedness of scientific research and that it would ultimately hinder American innovation and economic growth.",
      "And a group of 12,041 Harvard alumni, including prominent names like Conan O\u2019Brien and author Margaret E. Atwood, filed a separate brief describing the withholding of funds as a \u201creckless and unlawful\u201d attempt to assert control over the school and other higher education institutions.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, suggested Friday on social media that he may be able to settle his differences with the school.",
      "\"Many people have been asking what is going on with Harvard University and their largescale improprieties that we have been addressing, looking for a solution. We have been working closely with Harvard, and it is very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so,\" he said on Truth Social.",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" Trump said. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be 'mindbogglingly' HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\""

      "\u201cBeverly,\u201d a romance novel by indie author Laura J. Robert, had picked up recent buzz on the social media platform, where readers and authors often discuss the latest titles and give recommendations.",
      "But several creators removed their videos praising Robert\u2019s book after allegations emerged that it was a rip-off of the indie author R.J. Lewis\u2019 \u201cObsessed,\u201d which was published in 2016. Both books have plots that follow a lead female character and her romance with her childhood friend.",
      "Some people posted excerpts of Lewis\u2019 words juxtaposed with Robert\u2019s, identifying what they described as similarities. Others accused Robert of using artificial intelligence to tweak and lengthen Lewis\u2019 book to create her own version. A handful of people speculated the authors could be the same person \u2014 because Robert\u2019s initials are Lewis\u2019 initials backward \u2014 and that the controversy could all be a PR stunt.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach Robert on Friday. Lewis declined to comment further.",
      "On BookTok, some have cited the somewhat niche controversy as yet another example of the community\u2019s shift away from lighthearted content around new releases.",
      "\u201cDoes anyone miss just having a silly, goofy, fun time, having a bit of a laugh?\u201d Lola Oluremi, a BookTok creator, said in a recent video discussing \u201cBeverly\u201d and \u201cObsessed.\u201d \u201cI feel like every time I log onto BookTok now, it\u2019s something.\u201d",
      "The online space, which has been credited for inspiring a fresh wave of interest in literature, hasn\u2019t been devoid of drama in the past. But this month, the \u201cBeverly\u201d accusations followed two other separate situations that had caused some division among BookTokers online.",
      "Author Ali Hazelwood, who is behind popular novels such as \u201cThe Love Hypothesis,\u201d left Instagram purportedly after she was \u201cbullied\u201d for a comment she made during a panel discussion at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in April.",
      "Hazelwood weighed in on who she thought Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of Suzanne Collins\u2019 \u201cHunger Games\u201d books, should have ended up with romantically, saying it should have been her childhood friend Gale, rather than her fellow tribute, Peeta.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a terrible, mean, selfish person,\u201d Hazelwood said of the character Peeta, a baker\u2019s son from District 12 who was reaped alongside Katniss in the books. The clip of Hazelwood\u2019s remarks was widely circulated and blasted online by people who accused her of having a bad take.",
      "Hazelwood didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Since she went dark online, several BookTokers have come to her defense, reflecting on how the community has seemingly become more prone to getting lost in meaningless discourse.",
      "\u201cThe way y\u2019all have lost the plot over a fictional bread boy has left me genuinely questioning the mental health of the book community,\u201d Shelley Fleuridor, the YouTuber behind the channel \u201cBook Chats with Shelley,\u201d said in a recent video delving into the Hazelwood backlash. \u201cWe need to talk about what\u2019s happening to this community and why some of you genuinely need to be placed in a reading timeout immediately, maybe permanently.\u201d",
      "Also this past month, Victoria Aveyard, the author of the \u201cRed Queen\u201d books, sparked a wave of backlash and speculation on BookTok after she post a video alluding to another author\u2019s using generative AI in a novel without naming the purported writer.  She said she didn't name the person because she didn't want to get sued.",
      "\u201cUsing GenAI to come up with characters, plots and story ideas isn\u2019t writing. It\u2019s theft,\u201d Aveyard said. \u201cUsing GenAI doesn\u2019t make you a writer. It makes you a thief.\u201d  She said generative AI has been trained on copyrighted material that \u201chas been stolen from artists without license or compensation.\u201d",
      "Some subsequent posts from users accuse Aveyard of being a \u201cmean girl\u201d obsessed with \u201cdrama.\u201d In other videos, some try to guess which author she was referring to. Meanwhile, a handful of authors have also been posting videos of their writing and editing processes to prove their work isn\u2019t made with AI.",

      "Look at a few national election results and it\u2019s easy to think of the United States as a 50/50 nation overall, split down the middle between Republican red and Democratic blue. But that\u2019s not the reality in vast and growing swaths of the country, where political competitiveness at the local level is being replaced by landslide loyalty to a single party.",
      "Across the country, 20-point margins in counties Republicans were winning at the turn of the century have turned into 50-point margins or more in recent years. Meanwhile, the number of counties that flipped from one party to the other in each presidential election has shrunk.",
      "Data compiled by the NBC News Political Unit has shown the demographic trends that have organized our current political coalitions. But the geographical trends also help show how much of the reorganization has clustered along community lines over the last quarter-century. If some people talk like they\u2019ve never had political conversations with people who disagree with them, it could be because that\u2019s more possible than ever before in today\u2019s politically clustered United States.",
      "Looking at blowout county wins",
      "George W. Bush\u2019s Electoral College win in 2000 was famously razor-thin. But his average win across the country\u2019s 3,100-plus counties was about 17 points. Democrats\u2019 advantage in population-dense urban cores bolsters their popular vote count election after election. But Republicans\u2019 advantage in rural counties has been a core part of the Republican playbook, with small-county wins with margins of 50 points or more adding up, bit by bit, to a substantial coalition. These were the counties where each candidate had 50-plus-point-margin wins in the 2000 election:",
      "Bush captured major wins across the Plains states and up through the Mountain West, while Al Gore racked up margins of 50-plus points in the densely populated New York City boroughs, Philadelphia, Baltimore and some scattered rural areas with large Black populations.",
      "But more than two decades later, President Donald Trump has dramatically expanded the number of blowout win counties.",
      "Trump has grown Republican political advantages east of the older GOP bulwarks and has captured Appalachia, which was once a reliably Democratic region, continuing to drive up margins in rural America. The average size of a Trump blowout county was about 10,000 voters last year. On the flip side, Democrats have grown their advantages in population-dense cities and suburbs, with the San Francisco Bay Area; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle emerging on this map as heavily Democratic areas. The average size of a blowout county for Kamala Harris was 210,000 voters.",
      "Some of the most important political coalitions for Democrats emerge on this map, especially in comparison with 2000. The 2024 map shows the birth of Democratic vote powerhouses in majority-Black DeKalb and Clayton counties in Georgia and in Wisconsin\u2019s Dane County, home of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, with its heavily white and college degree-holding population. Both coalitions are essential to Democratic wins in those states in recent elections.",
      "Overall, there are four times as many blowout counties today than there were at the turn of the century.",
      "Counties flipped",
      "One consequence of the sharp rise in blowout counties: a precipitous decline in swing counties.",
      "Back in the 2004 election, 227 counties flipped from one party to the other compared with the 2000 election. But last fall, only 89 changed their party preferences from the 2020 election.",
      "The total number of flipped counties has dropped over the century. The biggest spikes occurred in the 2008 first-term election of Barack Obama and the 2016 first-term election of Trump \u2014 moments when the party coalitions changed dramatically.",
      "Trump\u2019s 89-county flip in this last election was actually an increase over the 80 counties that flipped in Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. The last election was also statistically notable for another reason: Harris became the first candidate this century who didn\u2019t flip a single county compared with the previous election."

      "Proposed cuts to health insurance programs in the budget bill being pushed through Congress by President Donald Trump could put hundreds of thousands of health care jobs at risk \u2014 jeopardizing one of the few notably strong areas of the U.S. job market.",
      "Congressional Republicans are advancing a budget plan that would cause nearly 8 million people on Medicaid to lose their health insurance coverage, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, with an additional 2 million people  to lose coverage through the Affordable Care Act if Congress remains on track to let health insurance tax subsidies expire at the end of the year.",
      "Less funding for Medicaid and fewer people with health insurance would mean a drop-off in doctor\u2019s office visits, prescription refills and medical procedures \u2014 and, as a result, fewer workers needed to support those types of services. It could lead to the loss of nearly 500,000 health care jobs over the next decade, according to an analysis by George Washington University and the Commonwealth Fund. The expiration of the ACA tax subsidies, which were enacted in 2021, would result in the loss of an additional 140,000 jobs, a separate analysis from George Washington University found.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, health centers will close, pharmacies in some parts of the country will close because they will lose revenue,\u201d said Leighton Ku, director for the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, who worked on the analyses. \u201cThere are going to be job losses, and we\u2019re talking about middle class jobs being lost.\u201d",
      "That would be a blow to one of the strongest, steadiest areas of the job market in recent years. Health care accounted for nearly half of the jobs added in the U.S. in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, around half of the 2.2 million jobs added to the economy were in health care-related sectors, according to an analysis by S&P Global. That has helped offset job cuts and stagnant growth in other sectors of the labor market, like retail and manufacturing.",
      "\u201cRight now, a lot of what is driving these positive headline numbers and bolstering the labor market is the health care sector,\u201d said Allison Shrivastava, an economist with job listing site Indeed.com. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been a constant. The health care sector has been a pretty big mainstay as the rest of the labor market has cooled.\u201d",
      "The health insurance provisions are part of a broader spending bill that has passed the House and is currently making its way through the Senate. The legislation, which Republicans have dubbed the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" would cut around $800 billion from Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled, in order to help offset some of the $4 trillion in tax cut extensions in the bill for individuals and corporations.",
      "A version of the bill currently in the Senate, which plans to start voting on the legislation next week, would go even further in reducing spending on Medicaid, by including a provision to limit states\u2019 use of taxes on hospitals and other health care providers that help states fund their share of the Medicaid program.",
      "The cuts would take a particular toll on health care providers in rural areas, where patients are more likely to be insured through Medicaid than those in metro areas. Researchers at Georgetown University found that 40% of children in small and rural towns receive their health insurance from Medicaid.",
      "Already, one-third of all rural hospitals in the country are at risk of closing because of financial difficulties, according to a report this month from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.",
      "Also at risk are Community Health Centers, which employ more than 300,000 workers and receive a portion of their funding from the federal government. Those centers, which serve at least 32 million mostly lower-income patients a year, get about 40% of their revenue from Medicaid.",
      "\u201cOur health centers operate on razor-thin margins, so any kind of disruption in payments or reimbursements, even for a short time, can have a significant impact,\u201d said Joe Dunn, chief policy officer for the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cAbout 40% of health centers are in rural America, and oftentimes they are the only primary care in that community. We have health centers in towns of a few hundred people, and there may not be any other kind of health care network there.\u201d",
      "Absent any policy changes from Congress, the health care sector had appeared to be on track for continued growth \u2014 and largely isolated from wider concerns about tariffs and an economic slowdown. The number of job postings for doctors and surgeons on Indeed.com are about 90% higher than their pre-pandemic levels, listings for home health aides are up 46%, and openings for nurses are up 16%, Shrivastava said.",
      "Health care job postings on ZipRecruiter.com represent 27% of all active job listings and health care postings are beginning to make up a larger share of new job postings, according to data from ZipRecruiter.",
      "A loss of that hiring momentum from funding cuts would leave one less positive driver for the job market.",
      "\u201cRight now, the labor market as a whole is arguably in a stagnant position,\u201d said Shrivastava. \u201cPeople are not wanting to leave their jobs, they\u2019re nervous about whether or not they\u2019ll be able to find another job, and companies aren\u2019t really looking to hire. Health care has been the exception to that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin boyfriend and girlfriend who have been charged with attempted murder are accused of trying to poison two women the man previously dated after he met them online, authorities said.",
      "Paul VanDuyne Jr., 43, and Andrea Whitaker, 41, have each been charged with attempted murder, aggravated battery, recklessly endangering the public and stalking, according to criminal cases filed in the Madison region.",
      "On Friday, they appeared in court separately in Janesville, in Dane County, which also is home to the state capital. Bail was set at $10 million for VanDuyne, who prosecutors said has access to substantial resources, and $4 million for Whitaker.",
      "Pleas were not entered, and each remained in custody, according to jail records. The defendants have separate lawyers, who did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "One of the two victims \u2014 each of whom met VanDuyne on a dating app and saw him only a few times \u2014 described an experience discovering a stranger she later realized was Whitaker crouched next to her vehicle in her garage in April.",
      "The woman is identified in redacted court records as the victim from Dane County; the other woman is identified as the victim from Rock County. The Dane County woman said Friday in court that she met VanDuyne more than a year ago, went on two dates with him and told him she was not interested in seeing him again.",
      "\"I was never his girlfriend, yet he and Andrea developed the delusion that I was,\" she said in court Friday. \"This delusion was so strong, they tried to murder me. Their actions and motivations are disconnected from reality. Both have shown their capacity for evil.\"",
      "Appearing at VanDuyne's hearing, the woman said that after she discovered the allegations against the couple, she has people stay with her overnight, she installed a security system, and she hides her vehicle.",
      "\"I need the court's protection,\" she said. \"The community needs the court's protection.\"",
      "Prosecutors said VanDuyne met Whitaker online roughly during the time he dated the victims and carried on a relationship virtually as she took courses in the field of pharmacology away from the area.",
      "Upon completing her courses, she moved nearby, and the two met in person in the spring, according to narratives presented in case documents.",
      "VanDuyne graduated from Princeton University more than 20 years previously, the institution confirmed. He had a career as a mechanical engineer, his lawyer said in court Friday. Documents in the Rock County case say he was recently divorced and started dating the victims after having met them on dating apps or sites that were not named.",
      "When he connected with Whitaker, the two embarked on a plot against the victims, prosecutors said.",
      "The victim from Rock County came to the attention of authorities in early May when a doctor from the Wisconsin Poison Center reported that a woman was hospitalized with thallium in her system, the court documents say.",
      "Thallium was once commonly used to kill rodents. Largely because of accidental poisonings, it has been banned from household use in the United States since 1965 and commercially since 1975.",
      "The doctor, identified only by a last name, is quoted as saying, \u201cThe only way a human could have this amount of thallium in her system is if they were intentionally consuming it.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said the victim reported no suicidal action and struggled to think of anyone who would try to poison her \u2014 the names she came up with were vetted \u2014 until VanDuyne came to mind, according to the documents from Rock County.",
      "She told detectives about texts she had received in early 2025 from the man she knew only as Paul when they dated starting nearly two years before, the documents say.",
      "She gave investigators VanDuyne's number, and they started looking at him this month, according to the court documents.",
      "She said he had sent her texts in the spring after months of no contact. In them, the Rock County victim said, he called her \"evil\" and blamed her for causing his girlfriend, Whitaker, to kill herself when she discovered their dating history, the documents say.",
      "Whitaker did not kill herself.",
      "In fact, court documents allege, she was integral to the plot to kill the two other women VanDuyne  had dated, and they worked together to taint water bottles and vehicles with poisons they procured or, in one case, made from scratch.",
      "In the May incident that sent the Rock County victim to the hospital, the woman took her middle-school-age sister to the movies but both became ill, according to the documents. The victim took her vehicle to a dealership, where workers reported a noxious smell and tossed out a storage tote they said contained an unknown substance, the documents say.",
      "Because the woman and her sister described a smell of rotten eggs, detectives concluded the substance was hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas.",
      "Rock County Sheriff Curtis Fell said the Rock County victim was still in a wheelchair as a result of her poisoning. Without the medical care she has received \u2014 including an antidote flown overnight from California \u2014 she most likely would have died, he said.",
      "The alleged plot affected the other victim, the woman from Dane County, not long afterward, in mid-May, when bystanders reported someone breaking into her vehicle at a Costco parking lot on two separate occasions, according to the documents.",
      "A witness at the Costco parking lot reported seeing a man get into a Chrysler Pacifica minivan that was traced back to VanDuyne, authorities said in the documents.",
      "After one of the incidents, the victim reported drinking bottled water she left in her vehicle and noticing it tasted terrible, the court documents say. The water tested positive for cyanide and thallium.",
      "After they realized the two women may have been the victims of the same perpetrators, authorities took a second look at the Rock County victim's vehicle and concluded it was the subject of break-ins or attempts with markings similar to those made in the Costco attempts, the documents say.",
      "Detectives got a judge's permission to track VanDuyne's movements and found him traveling to the Rock County victim's residence, according to the documents. After that trip, they allege, authorities found a trail camera hung on a tree across from the victim's home.",
      "In other instances, the couple worked together to use cyanide, thallium and abrin in multiple attempts to poison the victims, once even putting a powdery substance in the ventilation system of a victim's vehicle, authorities said in the court documents.",
      "Abrin can be made by grinding the seeds of rosary peas, authorities said in the documents.",
      "On Thursday, a search of VanDuyne's minivan turned up a tan bag with multiple vials inside, the court documents say. Authorities found rosary peas in the bag and a seed grinder at his home, the documents say.",
      "An FBI hazardous materials team was called to help with the search, and members took an active part multiple times, the documents say.",
      "The defendants were expected to appear in Rock County court next week to face charges of attempted murder and stalking for VanDuyne and attempted murder and aiding a felon for Whitaker.",
      "VanDuyne is due in Dane County court again Aug. 4. Whitaker is scheduled for an appearance there July 2."

      "A scandal over allegations of plagiarism is rocking the book community on TikTok, becoming the latest drama to unfold in a pocket of the internet that was once considered a safer space from online toxicity.",
      "\u201cBeverly,\u201d a romance novel by indie author Laura J. Robert, had picked up recent buzz on the social media platform, where readers and authors often discuss the latest titles and give recommendations.",
      "But several creators removed their videos praising Robert\u2019s book after allegations emerged that it was a rip-off of the indie author R.J. Lewis\u2019 \u201cObsessed,\u201d which was published in 2016. Both books have plots that follow a lead female character and her romance with her childhood friend.",
      "Some people posted excerpts of Lewis\u2019 words juxtaposed with Robert\u2019s, identifying what they described as similarities. Others accused Robert of using artificial intelligence to tweak and lengthen Lewis\u2019 book to create her own version. A handful of people speculated the authors could be the same person \u2014 because Robert\u2019s initials are Lewis\u2019 initials backward \u2014 and that the controversy could all be a PR stunt.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach Robert on Friday. Lewis declined to comment further.",
      "On BookTok, some have cited the somewhat niche controversy as yet another example of the community\u2019s shift away from lighthearted content around new releases.",
      "\u201cDoes anyone miss just having a silly, goofy, fun time, having a bit of a laugh?\u201d Lola Oluremi, a BookTok creator, said in a recent video discussing \u201cBeverly\u201d and \u201cObsessed.\u201d \u201cI feel like every time I log onto BookTok now, it\u2019s something.\u201d",
      "The online space, which has been credited for inspiring a fresh wave of interest in literature, hasn\u2019t been devoid of drama in the past. But this month, the \u201cBeverly\u201d accusations followed two other separate situations that had caused some division among BookTokers online.",
      "Author Ali Hazelwood, who is behind popular novels such as \u201cThe Love Hypothesis,\u201d left Instagram purportedly after she was \u201cbullied\u201d for a comment she made during a panel discussion at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in April.",
      "Hazelwood weighed in on who she thought Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of Suzanne Collins\u2019 \u201cHunger Games\u201d books, should have ended up with romantically, saying it should have been her childhood friend Gale, rather than her fellow tribute, Peeta.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a terrible, mean, selfish person,\u201d Hazelwood said of the character Peeta, a baker\u2019s son from District 12 who was reaped alongside Katniss in the books. The clip of Hazelwood\u2019s remarks was widely circulated and blasted online by people who accused her of having a bad take.",
      "Hazelwood didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Since she went dark online, several BookTokers have come to her defense, reflecting on how the community has seemingly become more prone to getting lost in meaningless discourse.",
      "\u201cThe way y\u2019all have lost the plot over a fictional bread boy has left me genuinely questioning the mental health of the book community,\u201d Shelley Fleuridor, the YouTuber behind the channel \u201cBook Chats with Shelley,\u201d said in a recent video delving into the Hazelwood backlash. \u201cWe need to talk about what\u2019s happening to this community and why some of you genuinely need to be placed in a reading timeout immediately, maybe permanently.\u201d",
      "Also this past month, Victoria Aveyard, the author of the \u201cRed Queen\u201d books, sparked a wave of backlash and speculation on BookTok after she post a video alluding to another author\u2019s using generative AI in a novel without naming the purported writer.  She said she didn't name the person because she didn't want to get sued.",
      "\u201cUsing GenAI to come up with characters, plots and story ideas isn\u2019t writing. It\u2019s theft,\u201d Aveyard said. \u201cUsing GenAI doesn\u2019t make you a writer. It makes you a thief.\u201d  She said generative AI has been trained on copyrighted material that \u201chas been stolen from artists without license or compensation.\u201d",
      "Some subsequent posts from users accuse Aveyard of being a \u201cmean girl\u201d obsessed with \u201cdrama.\u201d In other videos, some try to guess which author she was referring to. Meanwhile, a handful of authors have also been posting videos of their writing and editing processes to prove their work isn\u2019t made with AI.",
      "With \u201cBeverly,\u201d it remains unclear whether there will be consequences for Robert beyond online fallout.",
      "Robert\u2019s social media pages and her author website were no longer online Friday. \u201cBeverly\u201d has also been removed from Amazon. The title remains on GoodReads, where several people have posted comments about the plagiarism accusations and given the book a one-star review.",
      "A spokesperson for Amazon, which owns GoodReads, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lewis posted about the plagiarism allegations on Instagram this week, calling the situation an indie author\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare.\u201d",
      "\"I'm an author who does not have a big online presence and thank all who have reached out to bring this to my attention as I don't have much visibility on the social media space,\" she wrote.",
      "She said she has contacted Amazon to raise a copyright infringement case and hopes \u201cthat people in the booktok space realize this author is stealing content and profiting from it.\u201d"

      "A communications operator looking out the airport office window advised the pilot that there was a turtle on the runway, according to the report released this week. The operator reported that the pilot landed about 1,400 feet down the 2,424-foot runway, then lifted the right main wheel to avoid the turtle. The operator heard the pilot advance the throttle after raising the wheel, but the airplane left her view after that.",
      "A man cutting the grass at the end of the runway reported seeing the pilot raise the right wheel to avoid the turtle, then the wings rocked back and forth and the plane took off again, according to the report. The man lost sight of the plane and then he heard a crash and saw smoke.",
      "The plane crashed in a heavily forested area about 255 feet from the runway and caught fire, officials said. The plane was wedged between several trees and remained in one piece except for a few pieces of fabric found in a nearby stream. It came to rest on its left side with the left wing folded underneath the fuselage and the right wing bent toward the tail.",

      "A Colorado man suspected of killing his wife was charged Friday for the second time with first-degree murder in her 2020 death, the 12th Judicial District Attorney's Office said in a release.",
      "Barry Morphew was previously charged with first-degree murder, among other charges, in May 2021 in the killing of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who was last seen on Mother's Day in 2020. But those charges were dropped without prejudice \u2014 meaning charges could be filed again at a later date \u2014 in April 2022 as prosecutors were closing in on finding the woman's remains.",
      "Officials took Morphew into custody in Arizona on Friday, the district attorney's office said, but the office is working to extradite the man back to the San Luis Valley in Colorado.",
      "Twelfth Judicial District Attorney Anne Kelly said Morphew will be held in Arizona as the extradition proceedings play out, at which point he will be taken back to Alamosa County to stand trial on an indictment, unsealed Friday upon Morphew's arrest. She would not say why Morphew was in Phoenix at the time of his arrest.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Morphew is being held in jail or if he has obtained legal representation.",
      "Iris Eytan, the attorney who represented Morphew in the earlier proceedings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear whether she is still representing him.",
      "Suzanne Morphew vanished in May 2020",
      "Suzanne Morphew was last seen on May 10, 2020, near County Road 225 and West Highway 50 in Maysville, about 100 miles west of Colorado Springs. She was on a bike ride at the time.",
      "A 49-year-old mother of two, Suzanne Morphew was reported missing from her Chaffee County home by neighbors that same day, according to the indictment unsealed Friday. Her husband was the last known person to see her alive, and the only other person who lived in their house, their daughter, was out of state on a pre-planned trip that day.",
      "Also that day, her mountain bike was discovered on the side of a county road in Salida, Colorado, near the family's home. Days later, her helmet was found in a different nearby location, the indictment said.",
      "When officials arrived to the Morphew home to investigate, they found the house locked and Suzanne Morphew and her bike missing, the indictment said. There were no signs of a break-in and DNA testing did not turn up any intruder suspects.",
      "Her husband had repeatedly denied his involvement in her death,  and he pleaded not guilty to the initial charges.",
      "When he was interviewed by police, Morphew said that he left his house at 5 a.m. the day the wife disappeared to go to a worksite in Broomfield, according to the indictment. She was still asleep in bed when he left town, he said.",
      "When he got to Broomfield, Morphew said, he checked into a hotel before heading to the job site for the rest of the day. That's where he was, he said, when he got a call from concerned neighbors who said his daughters were struggling to reach their mother. When they couldn't find Suzanne Morphew or her bike, he told them to call police.",
      "One of Morphew's employees who was supposed to accompany him on the trip to Broomfield disputed that telling of events, the indictment said. The employee told police the pair was supposed to leave the evening of May 10, but Morphew left early that morning without telling him.",
      "Cameras in Broomfield placed Morphew at the job site for less than a half-hour, the indictment said. The cameras also caught him driving around town and throwing \"unknown items in separate trash cans.\"",
      "Morphew was seen at the hotel on surveillance cameras throughout the afternoon, meaning he was there when the neighbors called him, not at the job site, according to the indictment.",
      "Morphew's first set of charges were dismissed before his wife's remains were found",
      "One week before Morphew was set to stand trial on the initial charge of first-degree murder in his wife's disappearance, prosecutors dismissed the charges because they said they had zeroed in on an area where they believed her remains to be, but weather in the region was prohibiting officials from recovery efforts, slowing down the case.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's remains were finally uncovered in September 2023 \"in a shallow clandestine grave,\" according to the indictment. They were found during an unrelated search near Moffat in Saguache County, officials said at the time.",
      "Prosecutors believe Suzanne Morphew's remains were moved to that location at some point after her killing, and said it was unlikely that was the place where she was killed and where her body decomposed. Bike clothes were also found with her remains, but lacked signs of decomposition, which made it unlikely she wore those clothes as her body broke down.",
      "An April 2024 autopsy determined she died by homicide, which reported that drugs normally used as animal tranquilizers were found in her system.",
      "People who knew Morphew when he lived in Indiana before his 2018 move to Colorado said he was a deer farmer who used a specific tranquilizer called \"BAM,\" which is composed of the three drugs found in his wife's autopsy \u2014\u00a0butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine, the indictment said. He admitted to using the tranquilizer in both states and as recently as the month before Suzanne Morphew disappeared.",
      "Suzanne Morphew \"died as a result of homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication,\" the El Paso County coroner's report, obtained by NBC News at the time, said.",
      "This determination was made, the indictment said, because the autopsy also showed her body had begun to metabolize the chemicals, meaning \"that her death was not immediate following BAM exposure.\"",
      "\"The drugs are marketed as a compound injectable chemical immobilizer for wildlife providing pharmacologically reversible analgesia, sedation, and immobilization,\" the report said.",
      "A pharmacologist and medical doctor who testified in the case told officials that before Suzanne Morphew's death, BAM could be purchased only with a prescription from a veterinarian from one company in the U.S., according to the indictment.",
      "Records indicated Morphew filled and received \"several\" BAM prescriptions in Indiana and that he appeared to stock up on the tranquilizer before moving states. Police found no other private citizens or businesses in the area to have obtained BAM from 2017 to 2020, the indictment said.",
      "\"Ultimately, the prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew,\" the indictment said.",
      "Prosecutors had said they believed Morphew used a tranquilizer gun in his wife's murder.",
      "While searching their home following Suzanne Morphew's disappearance, police found a locked gun safe containing a tranquilizer gun and darts near the front, the indictment said. Police also found a pair of Morphew's shorts and a needle cap from one of the darts in the house's dryer.",
      "Suzanne Morphew was considering divorce at her time of death",
      "According to the indictment unsealed Friday, in early interviews with police, Morphew said his marriage was \"the best.\" When officers asked if his wife would say differently, he said \"no.\"",
      "But prosecutors had previously said Morphew was the only person with motive to kill Suzanne Morphew, because she was having an affair, believed her husband was having one too, and had plans to file for divorce.",
      "The indictment indicates that in the weeks and months leading up to her disappearance, Suzanne Morphew told people she was unhappy in her marriage, and searches of her house and phone found documentation of problems in their relationship.",

      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Day 27 of the trial:",

He recalled being asked to buy thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of drugs.

      "\ud83d\udd0e The view from inside",
      "Diddy, wearing a white sweater and black pants, appeared engaged in today\u2019s testimony. He seemed to pay close attention to prosecutor Maurene Comey as she questioned U.S. government summary witness Joseph Cerciello, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Paul, the ex-assistant, struck an ambiguous note as he concluded testimony for the day. When asked by prosecutor Christy Slavik how he feels about Diddy today, Paul replied with two cryptic words: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d",
      "\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Analysis: In this case, the star witnesses are text messages",
      "Cerciello, the Homeland Security special agent, testified about charts of evidence compiled by prosecutors to confirm they correspond to thousands of pages of records, including text messages.",
      "Diddy will almost surely not testify. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. That\u2019s because in a modern criminal case \u2014 especially a federal criminal case \u2014 prosecutors can get witnesses and defendants\u2019 \u201ctestimony\u201d in front of the jury without them ever taking the stand. Combing through thousands of pages of text messages is something at which special agents and federal prosecutors excel. It doesn\u2019t matter that a single text message or a short series of messages could be taken out of context. Prosecutors will introduce it and add their own context. After all, if the defendant thinks these statements are misleading, he can take the stand and dispute them, right? Except, most of the time, the defendant does not take the stand.",
      "In this case so far, the star witnesses have arguably not been the humans. They have been things like text messages, financial records and other documents. For some reason, people have always put things in text messages as though they could never become public. We\u2019re all guilty of that, too. All of us are likely part of a text message \u201cgroup\u201d with our friends or family where we say things that, if publicly revealed, would cause us a lot of problems. Certainly for Diddy, these texts have caused him a lot of problems \u2014 arguably more than the people who testified against him.",
      "\ud83d\uddd3 What\u2019s next",
      "U.S. government prosecutors are expected to rest their case on Monday. Diddy\u2019s defense team has signaled it will need around two days to present its case. If that rough timeline holds, closing arguments could take place Thursday.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent Andrea Canning chats with NBC News\u2019 Chloe Melas and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.

      "The 36 women who end up on the team appear to spend hours at dance rehearsals, volunteering around Dallas, Texas, and performing at games. At one point in the docuseries, the cheerleaders\u2019 coaching staff said that the dancers typically clock an 11-hour day on game days.",
      "But the show also revealed that most of the women work an additional full-time job, on top of being a Cowboys cheerleader. In their introduction, some of the cheerleaders said they worked jobs as doctors, nurses, accountants, fitness instructors and more.",
      "How Much Do NFL Cheerleaders Make?",
      "In 2024, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d director and executive producer Greg Whiteley told Glamour that he never received a \u201cclean answer\u201d on the cheerleaders\u2019 wages.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because it varies depending on how senior you are in the group. You may even get paid more if you\u2019re a group leader, though that was never clear to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The rates for NFL cheerleaders are not made public, but some reporting, as well as the docuseries, give insights into estimates.",
      "In \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d former Cowboys cheerleader Kat Puryear, who concluded her tenure on the team in 2022, compared their pay to that of \u201ca substitute teacher\u201d or a full-time \u201cChick-fil-A worker.\u201d",
      "In a follow-up video Puryear shared to TikTok in June 2024, she explained that, when she was on the team, the cheerleaders were paid a flat fee for games, in addition to an hourly rate.",
      "For public appearances, cheerleaders were also paid an hourly rate and flat fee, but tenure plays a role in that amount, she said in the video. Because many of the women work another job, Puryear said the public appearances were not required. She added that for practices, the athletes are solely compensated an hourly rate.",
      "\u201cSo all in all, it\u2019s a full-time commitment, part-time pay,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "As seen in the docuseries, DCC members also score several perks as part of their roles, including meal prep services, gym memberships, beauty services (tanning, nails, makeup, hair, skincare, etc.), products, dental treatments and more.",
      "NBC Sports Boston reported in 2022 that NFL cheerleaders make, on average, about $150 per game, which comes out to about $22,500 per year. The athletes were reportedly also making about $50 to $75 for public appearances at the time.",
      "However, pay differs among teams. The outlet reported that Dallas\u2019 cheerleaders in 2022 were making about $15-20 per hour, which, with game and public appearance fees, totaled to about $75,000 a year.",
      "Per old footage in the Netflix docuseries, the cheerleaders were, at one point, making $15 per game. However, in interviews with former cheerleaders, some said they were \u201csurprised (the Cowboys) paid anything,\u201d calling their job an \u201chonorary position.\u201d",

      "In Season 2 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d several members of the DCC have a message for Cowboys\u2019 management: Put your money where your mouth is.",
      "When it comes time to sign contracts for the year, a group consisting of several veteran DCC members unites to push for change.",
      "While some DCC members are hesitant to confront management, saying they can \u201ccan see both sides,\u201d others opened up about financial difficulties like being unable to pay rent and \u201cexhaustion\u201d from working multiple jobs.",
      "In the show, the group pushing for change consults with outside legal sources and meets with management, which doesn't initially lead to changes. The team considers a walkout to protest the pay, which falls through. Many still debate not turning in their contracts unless changes are made.",
      "In the season finale, however, the athletes receive great news: management has approved a 400% pay increase.",
      "While reflecting on the achievement, DCC Armani Latimer said, \u201cI love the fact that I made change for the girls that are coming up behind me even if I\u2019m not getting the chance to benefit.\u201d",

      "In regards to the increased salaries revealed at the end of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2, the Cowboys told NBC News in a statement June 18, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased, as you\u2019ll see in the series, that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders were happy with the outcome.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Jones, Cowboys\u2019 chief brand officer and daughter of team owner Jerry Jones, addressed the cheerleaders\u2019 pay in Season 1 of the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders \u2014 and as it should be. They\u2019re not paid a lot,\u201d Jones said in the first season. \u201cBut the facts are that they actually don\u2019t come here for the money. They come here for something that\u2019s actually bigger than that to them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have a passion for dance,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are not a lot of opportunities in the field of dance to get to perform at an elite level. It is about being a part of something bigger than themselves. It is about a sisterhood that they were able to form; about relationships that they have for the rest of their life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, former Cowboys cheerleader Erica Wilkins, who danced from 2014 to 2017, sued the organization for allegedly working over 40 hour weeks, making less than $7.25 per hour. The lawsuit, obtained by TODAY.com, also alleged that the team\u2019s mascot made more than the cheerleaders.",
      "At the time, Wilkins claimed in the lawsuit that she was making $200 per game. During her time on the team, Wilkins also claimed that her gross wages ranged from about $5,800 to $16,500 annually.",
      "Per court documents, Wilkins filed to dismiss the case in July 2018. In 2019, Wilkins\u2019 attorney told WFAA that the matter was resolved.",

    "story": [
      "Rafael L. Silva got the call that he booked \"The Waterfront\" on a Friday. On Tuesday, he was already filming.",
      "\"What I was understanding from the role itself \u2014\u00a0and it was my first time experiencing this in my young career \u2014 was that, oh, they want me to really just be me,\" he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"The Waterfront\" follows the affluent Buckley family in a fictional North Carolina coastal town as they struggle to keep their fishery business afloat and turn to drug smuggling to make ends meet.",
      "Silva's character, Shawn, is introduced as the new bartender at the family's restaurant. He shares that he's from Galveston, Texas, and in town because he \"wanted a change.\" But his skills \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014\u00a0behind the bar draw suspicion from Buckley matriarch Belle (Maria Bello).",
      "It's revealed in Episode 2 that Shawn was born from an affair between his late mother, Bebe, and head of the Buckley family, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany). Rather than a former bartender, Shawn is actually a law student at the University of Texas at Austin. (Silva, known for starring in the Austin-set \"9-1-1: Lone Star,\" which ended in February 2025, calls this a \"happy coincidence,\" adding, \"Maybe Shawn and Carlos crossed paths, we don't know.\")",
      "Shawn learned the name of his father as his mother died. So, he decided to temporarily leave his life as he knew it, including his boyfriend, to meet his family.",
      "\"Shawn goes the literal distance to learn who his father is, and learning the possibility that he has a father,\" Silva, 31, says. \"I, Rafael,  moved to this country with my mom and my brother to be reunited with my own father. I was 13, and we also went the literal distance for that to happen.\"",
      "Shawn likely never imagined folding into the fiercely loyal Buckley family. By the end, he\u2019s a key member of the group, stepping up to defend Belle when a threat arrives, and  coming up with a plan to save his half-sister Bree Buckley (Melissa Benoist) after she\u2019s kidnapped.",
      "\"The places where Shawn and I may share in our own existence is this blessed ignorance of not knowing what's ahead,\" he adds, \"but knowing that you have to let go of everything that you have in order to find out what you're capable of having or receiving in the future.",
      "\"That's something that I truly connect deeply, because as an immigrant in this country, and especially with the state of the country right now, we didn't come with any one agenda,\" the Brazilian actor says. \"I've never dreamed of being an actor. I never dreamed of living the life that I'm living now.\"",
      "Shawn's goal of finding where he belongs slowly unfolds over the course of the show, against the backdrop of Harlan, Belle, Bree and Cane's (Jake Weary) scheming to keep their business operating and their drug smuggling under the radar.",
      "\"If we go to the core of who I think this character is ... I think there's just this very quiet but thunderous need to not feel alone in life,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva says creator Kevin Williamson, also responsible for \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"The Vampire Diaries,\" essentially \"builds the foundation of a house.\" And Silva was able to add in details of the character from there, imagining key traits and a rich backstory. His key question was: Why is Shawn in Havenport, and why now?",
      "\"I did take my own creative place in justifying Shawn's relationship with his mother, and justifying, like, how come this m---------- can kick some ass, you know?\" he says.",
      "Silva says Shawn came to Havenport because his mother's death marked losing \"the most important person.\" Now, he essentially has nothing to lose.",
      "\"Yes, the romantic partner is important, but (with) family, when it comes to blood, it's irreplaceable,\" he says. \"Blood is irreplaceable when it comes to connection. And I think Shawn is after that.\"",
      "But Shawn\u2019s gradually introduced to the reality of the family\u2019s dealings, which Silva says likely runs counter to his \"strong moral compass\" and respect for the rules as a future lawyer. And by the end, Shawn may have signed up for more than he bargained for. In the explosive finale, Shawn and Cane hatch a plan to rescue Bree, sneaking onto drug supplier Grady's (Topher Grace) boat before a bloody shootout leaves Grady dead.",
      "\"I think Shawn is brokenhearted a little bit by the reality that he's come across who this family,\u00a0who his family, is,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva imagines that his character hoped for a world in which the family he met in Havenport was \"normal\" \u2014\u00a0or at least, not at the helm of a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"He's that compass in the family that is just like, constantly being bombarded with things that makes him want to crawl out of his own skin,\" Silva says. \"I also have questions for Kevin. Who is this guy in the face of all of this? Who has he become? Because at the end of the day, he's still Harlan's son.\""

      "The reviews are in!",
      "The new live-action remake of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has  arrived; we asked the real experts, kids, what they think about it.",
      "The film, which stars Mason Thames as Hiccup, Nico Parker as Astrid and Gerard Butler as Stoick, hit theaters on June 13.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Butler talked about the movie and revealed how it paid homage to the 2010 animated version, which was inspired by the best-selling book series of the same name.",
      "Butler said \"a fine line had to be tread to pay homage to the original to keep the essence of the story.\" However, with director Dean DeBlois at the helm, he said that the cast was able to \"bring something that felt real fresh and original\" to the film.",
      "What are kids saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY.com spoke with kids about the movie, and the reviews were generally positive. Joseph, 12, who adored the movie, says he thinks the remake is \"an amazing movie for all ages.\u201d",
      "\"I thought it was awesome. It had good graphics. It looked like real dragons, and I think it moved nicely,\" he says.",
      "Wylie, also 12, agrees.",
      "\"I thought it was really good. A lot of time when they remake old movies, they change the story or something like that. They didn\u2019t do that here at all. The movie itself looked great. Everything was well paced,\" he says.",
      "Any suggestions for improvement? Ruby, 9, thought that the movie could've been better if it had no intimate scenes.",
      "\"I hate the kissing,\" she says. On the other hand, Clara, 9, says that she wanted \"more kissing.\"",
      "(For the record, the kissing scene between the two young lead actors is quite minimal and chaste.)",
      "Wylie, a huge fan of the original series, says the film did a good job representing all the characters, both human and dragon.",
      "But Ruby and Jane, 7, say they were displeased with how the movie brought Gronckle, the most ferocious dragon in the film, to life, as well as some of the other beasts.",
      "\"The Gronckle looks weird,\" Ruby tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"One thing I would change about the movie is Gronckle because it doesn't look like the cartoon,\" Jane adds. \"The Hideous Zippleback, the Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare don\u2019t look anything like the cartoon.\"",
      "When asked if the remake was better than the cartoon, Jane declares,  \"It's a tie.\"",
      "Emma, 8, said the remake met all of her expectations.",
      "\"I love it so much. I love it. I love everything,\" she said. \"But I\u2019m so sad that Hiccup had to lose his leg, even though it\u2019s necessary. I cried like, maybe twice, maybe even three times. And it\u2019s a great movie. I really, really recommend it.\"",
      "What are parents saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY Digital reporter Rosie Colosi McDevitt saw the film with her daughters, Ruby and Jane, their friends, and her husband, Ryan.",
      "She said if other parents plan to take their kids to see \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" then there's some things they should look out for, like the jump scares in the movie and how real the monstrous beasts looked.",
      "\"They looked as real and scary as the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park,'\" she said. \"There were even a handful of jump scares. The sweet 7-year-old on my left clutched my arm and said, 'I\u2019m scared!' five different times, but the 4-year-old on my right was having a grand old time.\"",
      "As for Ryan, he says \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has a questionable moral lesson, from an adult perspective. He says he also realized that the film is \"a lot harsher\" than the animated version.",
      "\"It\u2019s a little bit more graphic ...  I don\u2019t know if I would change this, but kids are supposed to listen to their parents. In this case, Hiccup didn\u2019t listen to his father, but he turned out to be right, so that means the message is \u2026 don\u2019t listen to your parents?\" he wondered.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d focuses on the friendship between Hiccup, a young Viking lad, and his dragon, Toothless. Although his Viking village and the dragons are bitter historical enemies,  Hiccup and Toothless must come together to save their family and friends against a greater threat.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 rated?",
      "The movie is rated PG, which stands for parental guidance. This means that some material in the movie may not be suitable for young kids and parents should decide whether or not the film is appropriate for their kids to watch",
      "How is 'How to Train Your Dragon' different from the original?",
      "Bringing animated characters to life was no easy task. Butler said that he and the cast knew that they had some big shoes to fill for their roles, so they always thought about how they could make things \u201cmore richer and more nuanced\u201d for the remake.",
      "\u201cThis just sucks you in and it becomes its own story,\u201d he says of the remake. \u201cHow could anyone who\u2019s seeing this movie for the first time not be blown away or really enthralled and thrilled?\u201d",
      "Other than the effects, which brings the animated film to life, Butler said nothing comes close to the feeling that viewers will get from watching real actors play the roles.",
      "\u201cThe ability to see actual sadness, anger, fear, whatever that is, it makes it ultimately, a more powerful, emotional, relatable experience,\u201d he said."

      "The Buckley family\u2019s shady dealings caught up with them by the finale of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Waterfront.\u201d",
      "The show created by Kevin Williamson follows a fishing family dynasty in the fictional Havenport, North Carolina, as they struggle to financially stay afloat. The family\u2019s patriarch, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany), stepped away from leading the restaurant and fishery due to his health, leaving son Cane (Jake Weary) to take his place.",
      "The show, which hit Netflix June 19, opens with two of the Buckleys\u2019 employees being murdered after Cane decided to take on drug smuggling runs using the company\u2019s boats to bring in extra cash.",
      "From there, the entire family, including mom Belle (Maria Bello) and daughter Bree (Melissa Benoist), is implicated in Harlan and Cane\u2019s criminal activity, culminating in a final faceoff against Grady (Topher Grace), a supplier at the helm of the rapidly unraveling drug operation.",
      "And by the end of Episode 8, Williamson, known for creating \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s time for a new Buckley \u201cto step forward\u201d as leader of the pack.",
      "Below, read a breakdown of all the twists and turns in \u201cThe Waterfront\u201d Season 1 finale.",
      "How Does 'The Waterfront' End?",
      "\u201cThe Waterfront\u201d finale picks up right where Episode 7 ended, with yet another kidnapping. This time, it\u2019s Bree and her estranged son, Diller (Brady Hepner).",
      "Seeking revenge against the Buckleys, Grady took the mother and son to try and draw out patriarch Harlan, who was responsible for blowing up the farm where he produced opium.",
      "Back at the house, the family, which now firmly includes Shawn (Rafael Silva), revealed to be Harlan\u2019s son from an affair, hatches a plan to get Bree back. While Harlan pretends to surrender, Cane and Shawn sneak onto Grady\u2019s boat to free Bree and Diller.",
      "But before they arrive, Bree tries to fight back on her own. As a result, she\u2019s shot in the leg and thrown overboard. Diller throws her a life-saving kit, complete with a raft and flare gun.",
      "Unable to find Bree, Cane and Shawn reveal themselves to save Harlan, starting a shootout with Grady and his men.",
      "Who Dies in 'The Waterfront' Finale?",
      "In a final standoff on the boat, Harlan, Cane and Grady go face to face. Held at gunpoint by the father and son, Grady puts his weapon down.",
      "Taunting Cane for being unable to pull the trigger, Grady turns to Harlan and asks, \u201cYou want this guy for a son?\u201d",
      "Cane then shoots Grady multiple times in the face, and he falls into the water.",
      "Meanwhile afloat on the life raft, Bree falls in and out of consciousness before her family arrives to her rescue and rushes her to the hospital.",
      "In the waiting room, Cane appears haunted by the murder, but Harlan reassures him, \u201cGrady never would have stopped. ... You were protecting your family.\u201d",
      "Weary, who plays Cane, tells TODAY.com that the final murder represents a turning point for him.",
      "\u201cI think he crosses the threshold into the life of crime that he maybe never saw himself being thrust into,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it does come from a place of need, that he needs to protect his family and that means taking a life .... It\u2019s also proving to his father that he\u2019s capable of doing these things, and making him proud in a morbid way.\u201d",
      "What Does Belle Do?",
      "The show seemingly wraps on a high note for the Buckley family. Belle and Harlan reaffirm their love for each other, Cane reconnects with his wife Peyton (Danielle Campbell) after carrying on an affair, and Bree is reunited with Diller. Meanwhile, the new sheriff, Drew, tells Harlan the boat was \"all clean\" of any evidence, suggesting they quite literally got away with murder.",
      "Williamson says Season 1 is only the beginning for the Buckleys.",
      "\u201cBree has earned her place. She's no longer on the outside, she's no longer an outcast,\" Williamson says. \"And I think Cane has grown and he's gotten some answers. ... I think he's sort of reconciling his life choices.",
      "\"Harlan is going back to a life of crime, which he wears very well, and he kind of finds his purpose again,\" he adds. \"And I think Belle \u2014 we've just barely brushed the surface of this family.\"",
      "At the very end, Belle\u2019s previous attempt to save the Buckley enterprise comes back around. While Cane turned to drug running to raise the funds needed to keep their business open, Belle worked with Wes Benson (Dave Annable) to potentially sell some of their waterfront property in Havenport. Over the course of the dealings, Belle carried on an affair with Wes.",
      "Belle eventually backed out of the land deal, claiming the sale would \"kill\" Harlan. But having knowledge of the family's finances, Wes goes behind her back to buy up some of the Buckley family's debts, effectively taking away control of the property.",
      "While Harlan was furious at Belle going behind his back, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop her from doing it again. To get rid of some bodies at the fishery, Belle enlists the help of, in Williamson's words, a \"new threat in town\" \u2014 the Parkers.",
      "Belle calls on Emmett Parker, part of another crime-running family responsible for killing Harlan's father decades ago. Emmett reminds her of their shared history and says he's on her side.",
      "\"Maybe you should be in charge,\" he tells her. \"If you ever needed a favor, I could be a friend to you.\"",
      "Later at the hospital, Belle takes a call from Emmett.",
      "\"We'll help you with the land deal, but only if you take over,\" he says.",
      "The very last scene of Season 1 reveals that she took that deal. She walks into the fish house to find Emmett, with Wes tied up and brutally beaten.",
      "\"We'll need his complete loyalty, to both of us,\" Emmett explains after Belle asks if they're going to kill him.",
      "Emmett then rips the tape off Wes' mouth and says, \"Well, what do you have to say to your new boss?\"",
      "Williamson says Belle's turn to crime boss was a long time coming.",
      "\u201cShe married into the Buckleys, and I think she has always pulled the strings in the shadows,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cI think by the end, she realizes she\u2019s more of a Buckley than Harlan \u2014 and that it's time for her to stand front and center and he needs to sit down.",
      "\"She's tired of having to go through him and convince him and sort of work with him,\" he adds. \"And now she's just going to take charge.\"",
      "Overall, Season 1 leaves the Buckleys and Belle \u201cbeholden to this other crime family \u2014 and that's not going to go well,\" Williamson says."

      "\u201cI lived through it,\u201d Williamson tells TODAY.com, referring to his father, \"who did a little drug trafficking on his fish boat in the '80s.\"",
      "Williamson\u2019s dad, a fisherman, was charged with conspiracy to traffic marijuana in excess of 20,000 pounds, per Netflix's Tudum.",
      "\u201cI lived through him getting caught. I lived through the trial. I lived through him going to prison,\" Williamson adds.",
      "The show was filmed around Wilmington and Southport, North Carolina, and Williamson grew up less than three hours away.",
      "\u201cI love filming here. The coast gives us these beautiful vistas, and the community has a strong film culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like coming home.\u201d",
      "Speaking to the inspiration for the Buckleys\u2019 dynamics throughout \u201cThe Waterfront,\u201d Williamson says he was raised by \u201ca crazy Southern family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fabulous. They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re insane and shrewd and smart and lovely and gorgeous,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cI just love my family. I love all the drama I went through as a kid. I love it because it just is \u2026 it\u2019s such a source book to pull from when I\u2019m writing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tell the story of a Southern family living on the coast. People that love each other, but do crazy things,\u201d he adds.",
      "The core Buckley family consists of patriarch Harlan and his wife, Belle, along with their two children, son Cane, trying to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps as he leads the fishery, and daughter Bree, a recovering addict.",
      "Harlan Buckley, portrayed by Holt McCallany, is a man struggling to hold his family and their burgeoning criminal empire together.",
      "\u201cHarlan is an old-fashioned guy in many ways. His father was that kind of a guy, that was a leader that people admired and looked up to,\" McCallany says. \"They say that you can either lead by being loved or by being feared. And I think that Harlan would like to lead by being loved.\"",
      "\"He loves his family, but if he has to get dangerous, he'll do it,\" he adds.",
      "Melissa Benoist plays Bree and describes her character as someone fighting for redemption and a place at the table. Her driving motivator is that \"she desperately wants to be seen and to be loved and to be accepted by them.\"",
      "\u201cSobriety is keeping her grounded when we meet her,\u201d Benoist says. \u201cHer AA meetings that she's going to every single day, I think that is her lifeline.\"",
      "Cane is a protective but impulsive character torn between loyalty and ambition.",
      "\"I think he wants prosperity,\" Weary says. \"Much like Harlan, I think his love for his family is unwavering, and I think he really, ultimately, wants the best for everyone.\"",
      "While the eight-episode show includes plenty of plot twists, violent turns and criminal activity, the complicated family dynamics are at the heart of it.",
      "\"I do think they have trouble trusting each other, but they love each other,\" Williamson says. \"... I wanted to tell a story about a bunch of messy people, and this is a messy family, and I think that's how every family is.\""

      "The \u201cEspresso\u201d singer said that her opinion on having phones at concerts changed after she attended a Silk Sonic concert in Los Vegas at which she had to lock up her own phone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a better experience at a concert,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "\u201cI genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies \u2014 wasn\u2019t alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone\u2019s singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Appearing on the latest cover of the magazine, Carpenter weighed in on a variety of topics including why she released a new album so soon after \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her new single \u201cManchild,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the intense scrutiny she and many other women face.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pessimistic, but I truly feel like I\u2019ve never lived in a time where women have been picked apart more, and scrutinized in every capacity. I\u2019m not just talking about me. I\u2019m talking about every female artist that is making art right now \u2026. We\u2019re in such a weird time where you would think it\u2019s girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it,\u201d she told Rolling Stone.",
      "That scrutiny is also part of what might be motivating the \u201cManchild\u201d singer to support banning phones at her concert, telling the magazine that even though she\u2019s grown up in an age of fans having iPhones at shows, there\u2019s also a downside.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t blame people for wanting to have memories. But depending on how long I want to be touring, and what age I am, girl, take those phones away. You cannot zoom in on my face. Right now, my skin is soft and supple. It\u2019s fine. Do not zoom in on me when I\u2019m 80 years old up there,\u201d she added.",
      "Carpenter\u2019s latest album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d recently made headlines for its provocative cover art, which was released on June 11. The image depicts the \u201cBed Chem\u201d singer wearing a black dress, on all fours next to a man\u2019s leg, with his hand clutching her hair.",
      "Fans took to the internet to weigh in, with some calling the art \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cnot a very empowering image for women.\u201d However, others viewed the album cover as a nod to \u201chow women are regarded by certain men.\u201d",
      "As for constantly being commented on online, Carpenter told Rolling Stone, \u201cWhen you get down the little rabbit hole is truly when people start commenting on you as a person or you physically. All of those things that you\u2019re already thinking on a day-to-day basis. You don\u2019t need a stranger from Arkansas to remind you.\u201d"

    "summary": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell that his government doesn\u2019t know \u201chow we can trust\u201d the U.S. after Israel's strikes.",
    "story": [
      "Iran is uncertain whether it can trust the United States in diplomatic talks after Israel launched an aerial attack on the country only days before scheduled negotiations with American officials, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "Asked by NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell whether a deal with the United States could be reached within the two-week time frame recently given by President Donald Trump, Araghchi said it was up to the Trump administration \u201cto show their determination for going for a negotiated solution.\u201d",
      "But he suggested Washington was perhaps not genuinely interested in diplomacy and had merely used talks as a \u201ccover\u201d for Israel\u2019s air attack.",
      "At her Thursday briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered what she said was a message from Trump: \u201cBased on the fact that there\u2019s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.\u201d (Promising some action or decision in \u201ctwo weeks\u201d is a frequent thing for Trump \u2014 he has done so over a dozen times just in the last two months \u2014 and he often does not make good on it.)",
      "Israel, a staunch U.S. ally, last week launched airstrikes two days before a sixth round of negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials, with intermediaries from Oman, had been scheduled to take place. U.S. officials said the administration was not involved in the Israeli military operation.",
      "\u201cSo they had perhaps this plan in their mind, and they just needed negotiations perhaps to cover it up,\u201d Araghchi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how we can trust them anymore. What they did was, in fact, a betrayal to diplomacy.\u201d",
      "During the interview, which was conducted in Geneva after he held talks with European top diplomats, Araghchi said that his government was ready to negotiate but that Israel first had to halt its aerial attacks on Iran.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not prepared to negotiate with them anymore, as long as the aggression continues,\u201d he said.",
      "Araghchi said Iran would not give up uranium enrichment as Trump has demanded, and he said he had made that clear to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cI told him several times zero enrichment is impossible,\u201d he said.",
      "Every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, Araghchi said.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "As for Witkoff, Araghchi said he appeared unable to deliver on what had been discussed in previous meetings.",
      "\u201cI think he is a gentleman, somebody you can work with, but unfortunately, he changed his words every time we met. So maybe that was because he couldn\u2019t deliver what he promised to us,\u201d Araghchi said.",
      "He added, \u201cThere is a lack of confidence now between us because he didn\u2019t deliver his promises and what he told us that we can do.\u201d",
      "He and Witkoff do continue to communicate, though, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are some direct messages, some indirect messages we\u2019re exchanging,\u201d Araghchi said. \u201cAnd we have explained each other\u2019s positions to each other in order to prevent misunderstandings.\u201d",
      "He added that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean negotiation. They have asked us to negotiate, but we negotiate only when it is negotiation and not dictation.\u201d",
      "Araghchi also said the bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities could not destroy the technical \u201cknowledge\u201d Iran has developed in its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cSuppose they destroy one facility or two,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can rebuild them, because the knowledge is here, the technology is there. We have achieved that ourselves, and the technology cannot be reversed, cannot be destroyed by bombs.\u201d",
      "If Trump decides to have the United States strike Iran, Araghchi said, his government reserves the right to retaliate, as it has done against Israel.",
      "\u201cWhen there is a war, both sides attack each other. That\u2019s quite understandable. And self-defense is a legitimate right of every country,\u201d Araghchi said.",
      "He added that \u201cif the U.S. joins Israel in these attacks, we will do the same.\u201d",
      "Addressing Israel\u2019s threat to target Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Araghchi said that such an act \u201cwould be the biggest crime they can commit\u201d but that \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d",
      "The supreme leader, who has held power in Iran since 1989, is an unelected Shiite cleric who holds ultimate political authority in the Islamic Republic and can overrule the elected parliament and president.",
      "Araghchi said Khamenei \u201chas millions of followers, not only in Iran but in other countries.\u201d",
      "Trump has said the United States knows where Khamenei is but is not planning to target him, \u201cat least not for now.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he regarded Trump\u2019s comments as a threat, Araghchi said: \u201cI see it more as an insult. And I\u2019m amazed how the president of the so-called superpower can talk like this. We have always talked about President Trump respectfully.\u201d",
      "Araghchi added that it was \u201ccertainly not acceptable the way that he talked about our respected leader.\u201d",
      "To revive negotiations between Iran and the United States, Washington only needs to tell Israel to halt its airstrikes on Iran, he said.",
      "\u201cI think if Americans are serious to go back to diplomacy, what it needs is only a telephone call from Washington to Tel Aviv to stop everything,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThey can stop this process very quickly, and then we will consider diplomacy once again.\u201d",
      "Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised the possibility that the Iranian regime could collapse because of the effect of the Israeli bombardment. But Araghchi said Iran endured a long war against Iraq shortly after the 1979 revolution and would persevere in the current conflict.",
      "He said that Iranians have a long history of independence and that he hopes Trump \u201cunderstands Iranians and our pride and dignity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are a great nation. We have lived ... for thousands of years in that place. We have never been a colony of any other power. We have been always independent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the cradle of civilization, the Persian civilization. So all those things cannot be bombed away.\u201d",
      "Araghchi is an experienced diplomat who was one of the top negotiators of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. That agreement limited Iran\u2019s nuclear work in return for an easing of U.S. and international sanctions. In his first term, Trump withdrew the United States from the accord."

      "Thanks to HEAL Palestine, a nonprofit group that aids the youngest victims of the Gaza war, children like 7-year-old Qamar Alkordi, who uses two-hand crutches to walk, have been able to play in a safe place with other wounded children and feel less alone.",
      "\"There\u2019s other kids, they have the prosthetic, they are walking, and this is, like, it makes me happy to see this,\" her mother, Huda Alkordi, said about the sleepaway camp, where Qamar played in an inflatable pool and sprayed other kids with water.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:00:22 GMT",
    "summary": "If Trump bombs Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, the main risk would be from the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb itself rather than radiation or chemicals.",
    "story": [
      "If President Donald Trump does decide to use the United States' largest conventional bomb to destroy Iran\u2019s fortresslike Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, the colossal force of the explosion would likely cause casualties among workers or anyone else still at the site.",
      "But it would not trigger a nuclear explosion or a widespread radiological or chemical spill, according to former nuclear officials and experts.",
      "Sitting to the south of Iran's capital, Tehran, the Fordo plant is used to enrich uranium for the production of nuclear energy or, potentially, a bomb. But although this uranium and its chemical byproducts can be harmful to ingest or touch without protective equipment \u2014 they won\u2019t create a wider blast or regional contamination, analysts say.",
      "That would only be the case if Fordo housed nuclear reactors or warheads, which international watchdogs and experts say is not the case.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re down there and it gets bombed, you\u2019re stuffed,\u201d Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the ex-commanding officer of the British military\u2019s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s because this is a 2,500-kilogram [about 5,500-pound] warhead we are talking about here,\u201d he said, referring to the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (or MOP), the largest non-nuclear bomb in the world, which only the U.S. has.",
      "Less of a bunker-buster and more of a mountain-buster, this is perhaps the only conventional ordnance in the world that could do the job if Trump did decide to bomb Fordo.",
      "\u201cBut if anyone thinks this would be like Chernobyl \u2014 absolutely not,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said. \u201cBlowing up uranium will not create a nuclear explosion; that is a very complex piece of science, which is why it\u2019s so bloody difficult to make nuclear bombs.\u201d",
      "There is also little chance of a wider radiation leak or spill impacting the surrounding area, according to Mark Nelson, founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, a research consultancy based in Chicago.",
      "That\u2019s because \u201cthe nuclear substances at Fordo are only very weakly radioactive,\u201d he said. Were this a nuclear plant or missile site, there could be \u201cfission products\u201d \u2014 the stuff uranium breaks down into during a nuclear reaction \u2014 which can cause a wider catastrophe.",
      "Scrutiny has nonetheless sharpened on Fordo as Trump deliberates whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced enrichment facility, Fordo was refining uranium to 60%, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\u2019s far more than the 3-5% needed for power plants \u2014 and far closer to the 90% required to build a warhead.",
      "Until 2018, Iran had been complying with a landmark deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program.",
      "The agreement was sealed by President Barack Obama in July 2015, along with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union. Most independent observers said it was successfully limiting Iran's nuclear program.",
      "That effectively collapsed when Trump walked away from the pact three years later.",
      "Iran had been back in talks with Trump when Israel started bombing last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had no choice because Iran was racing toward building a bomb, something the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has not been able to confirm.",
      "The watchdog has been nonetheless concerned about Fordo, where uranium\u2019s naturally mined form is turned into a gas and spun at high speed inside centrifuges. That separates its heavier isotope, uranium-238, from the lighter uranium-235 that can be used for civilian purposes or otherwise.",
      "Iran says Fordo was designed to hold 3,000 of these centrifuges, a \u201csize and configuration\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with a peaceful program,\u201d Obama said in 2009.",
      "Observers such as de Bretton-Gordon say the U.S.\u2019s enormous MOP bomb might be powerful enough not only to destroy this facility but effectively incase it under the collapsed mountain. That could produce a similar effect to the sarcophagus built around Chernobyl after the disaster in 1986, Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Whereas Chernobyl\u2019s protective enclosure is 40 feet thick, \u201cat Fordo we would be talking about a sarcophagus 200-feet thick,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the risk of contamination would be zero.",
      "If the uranium gas is released, it would partly decompose into hydrofluoric acid, a deadly substance that causes deep-tissue burns if touched without protective gear, and potentially fatal problems for the heart, lungs and nervous system if inhaled.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty chemical to be around without correct safety equipment and procedures,\u201d said Nelson at the Radiant Energy Group. Any blast survivors, or rescuers without the necessary safety equipment, would face \u201cextremely severe\u201d consequences, he said, but caveated that \u201cyou have to be really close and really unprotected.\u201d",
      "There is also a chance that radioactive material could seep into any water source that\u2019s running through the mountain. But the likely radioactive levels would be low \u2014 detectable rather than harmful \u2014 both Nelson and de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Ultimately, Nelson agreed, all of these risks pale in comparison with the threat posed by the MOP bomb itself, whose payload is upward of 5,500 pounds and weighs a total of 30,000 pounds.",
      "\u201cThe danger at the seaside of saltwater ingestion is real \u2014 even a few liters could kill you,\u201d he analogized. \u201cThis danger, however, is relatively small compared to drowning.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 A British judge on Thursday sentenced a Chinese Ph.D. student to a minimum of 24 years in prison for drugging and raping 10 women in England and China.",
      "Zhenhao Zou, 28, was convicted of the attacks, which took place from 2019 to 2023, during a four-week trial earlier this year at Inner London Crown Court.",
      "Judge Rosina Cottage on Thursday described Zou as a \u201cvery bright young man\u201d who used a manipulative \u201ccharming mask\u201d to hide that he is a \u201csexual predator.\u201d",
      "Zou was studying for a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at University College London in 2023 when the first woman came forward to allege that he had raped her. As part of the investigation, police seized Zou\u2019s phone, on which they found videos of him raping unconscious women. A search of his apartment in south London turned up sedatives and recording equipment.",
      "The investigation into Zou\u2019s crimes continues, and at least 24 women have come forward with new allegations as a result of the publicity surrounding his trial, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service said. Taken together, the cases would make him one of the worst sex offenders in U.K. history.",
      "Zou, who also used the name Pakho online, befriended fellow students of Chinese heritage on dating apps and WeChat, before inviting them for drinks and drugging them at his apartments in London or an unknown location in China.",
      "Using hidden or handheld cameras, Zou filmed nine of the attacks as \u201csouvenirs,\u201d and he kept a \u201ctrophy box\u201d of his victims\u2019 belongings, according to evidence presented at trial.",
      "Zou, who claimed the encounters were consensual, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possessing an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possessing a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offense.",
      "He was handed a life sentence and must serve a minimum of 24 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutor Saira Pike praised the victims who came forward to report Zou\u2019s \u201chorrific crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have been incredibly strong and brave,\u201d Pike said. \u201cThere is no doubt that their evidence helped us to secure his conviction, and the life sentence handed to him today.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thousands of supporters of Myanmar\u2019s jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi celebrated her 80th birthday Thursday by attempting to set a world record for the most birthday greeting videos, while others took to the streets in demonstrations against the military government that ousted her.",
      "Kalo Say Htoo, an organizer of the birthday video campaign, said the original goal was to collect 80,000 greeting videos to honor Suu Kyi and achieve a recognized Guinness World Record.",
      "The number of videos collected surpassed 103,000 on Thursday, tripling the current record of 32,207 achieved in 2017, organizers said.",
      "Suu Kyi was arrested in February 2021 when the military seized power from her democratically elected government. She was convicted on more than a dozen charges for offenses that her supporters say were concocted to keep her out of politics. She remains regarded by many in Myanmar as the country\u2019s legitimate leader while serving a 27-year prison term.",
      "Kim Aris, Suu Kyi\u2019s son living in London, said in a statement on Facebook Thursday that the campaign is a powerful testament to his mother\u2019s global support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my hope this achievement brings urgent attention to her plight and that of the people of Burma,\u201d said Aris, using the country\u2019s former name. \u201cHer voice may be silenced, but her flame will never be extinguished.\u201d",
      "Aris planned to run 80 kilometers (50 miles) to honor his mother\u2019s birthday, while encouraging others to show support with the numerical theme, such as walking for 80 minutes or making 80 recipes.",
      "More than 6,800 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces during a widespread armed struggle against military rule that began after generals seized power from Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Pro-democracy street protests in Suu Kyi\u2019s honor were held Thursday in areas that are not under military control including northern Kachin state, the central regions of Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway and in Tanintharyi in the south.",
      "Photos on social media showed demonstrators carrying flowers, birthday cakes and posters of Suu Kyi, as well as banners reading \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and urging supporters to strive for \u201cthe liberation of the entire nation, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201d",
      "The military government\u2019s supporters posted calls for the arrest of protesters.",
      "Several Western embassies posted pictures and illustrations on social media of red roses, with some issuing statements calling for Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners to be released.",
      "The Suu Foundation, a nonprofit humanitarian organization, and the law firm Zimeray & Finelle said in a joint statement Thursday that Suu Kyi was thought to have suffered an injury to her left arm during the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit the country in March."

      "The attack was necessary because Iran with nuclear weapons would pose an existential threat to Israel, he said. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the U.S. assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program had not changed since March, when the director of national intelligence told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building an atomic bomb."

      "The U.S. assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program has not changed since March, when the director of national intelligence told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building an atomic bomb, according to the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Comments by President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have painted a different picture, suggesting that Iran is racing toward creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that Iran was \u201ca few weeks\u201d from having a nuclear weapon, and Netanyahu said in a recent interview that Iran was pursuing a \u201csecret plan\u201d to build a bomb within months.",
      "\u201cThe intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear, was absolutely clear that they were working on a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,\u201d Netanyahu recently told Fox News. \u201cThey were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.\u201d",
      "U.S. intelligence reporting on Israel is typically based in part on information provided by Israel\u2019s intelligence services. It was unclear whether Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were based on a different interpretation of the same intelligence.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters he was perplexed by Trump's assertions as lawmakers have received a different picture from U.S. intelligence officials.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies assessed that Iran had not made a decision to build nuclear weapons but that it had stockpiles of enriched uranium far beyond what is required for civilian purposes. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since her testimony, the source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Warner said Wednesday that he received further confirmation of the March intelligence assessment \u201cthis week.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Trump publicly dismissed Gabbard\u2019s testimony, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said.\u201d",
      "Warner said the administration needed to clarify whether there was new intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "\u201cSo far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon. They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it\u2019s based upon fact and not political influence,\u201d he said.",
      "Building the bomb",
      "For Iran to acquire a nuclear arsenal, it would need to enrich uranium to 90% purity. At the moment, it has a significant amount of uranium enriched to 60%, about 400 kilograms\u2019 worth, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "It would take a small technical step to enrich to 90%. Iran has enough uranium now to produce up to 10 weapons over several weeks, according to U.S. officials\u2019 estimates.",
      "But enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels is only the first step. Then Iran would have to build and test a device that could be delivered in the form of a bomb or a missile. Estimates vary, but Western officials and analysts say it could take months to more than a year to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Weapons experts say that Iran is not weeks away from securing a nuclear weapon but that it is weeks away from securing enough fissile material for an eventual weapon.",
      "The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said in a report this month that \u201cIran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60 percent.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Grossi told CNN said that U.N. inspectors did not have proof that Iran was engaged in \u201ca systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Iran have probably set the country\u2019s nuclear program back by a few months, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Since it launched its campaign against Iran last week, Israel has bombed centrifuge plants used to enrich uranium, including a site at Natanz, south of Tehran, and labs used to convert uranium gas into a metal, according to the IAEA and Israeli officials.",
      "Israel says it has killed several nuclear scientists and targeted missile launch and storage sites in its air raids."
