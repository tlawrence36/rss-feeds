      "A \u201cSpace Man\u201d has been at Eurovision before, but never a Time Lord",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and Eurovision unite for an evening of music and intergalactic adventure on Saturday \u2014 all thanks to Russell T Davies.",
      "Before fans tune in for the annual song contest, they can enjoy Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor and Varada Sethu's Belinda Chandra attending the Interstellar Song Contest in an episode of the sci-fi series.",
      "In real life, the Eurovision Song Contest is an annual musical competition and TV event that sees 37 countries compete for a crystal microphone trophy over a four-hour live broadcast. In the interstellar version, aliens from 40 different worlds vie to win, also by singing.",
      "Davies says it took three years to pull it off the doubleheader because they had to work with the BBC to set the schedule and storylines in stone to ensure a perfect alignment.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sam Ryder took a \u201cSpace Man\u201d to Eurovision before, in 2022. Now, Gatwa will read out the U.K.\u2019s jury scores during the song contest's grand final, held this year in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "Talking to The Associated Press, Davies says that both Eurovision and \u201cDoctor Who\u201d share the DNA of old-fashioned Saturday night television, making the combination \u201cirresistible.\u201d",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "DAVIES: I almost think every episode of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is a great big celebration, sort of noise and color and spectacle, and that sums up Eurovision as well. In pitching this to Disney+ as well it\u2019s like, \u201cLook we\u2019re going out in 60 of your territories\u201d and Eurovision itself has a viewing figure that some years is bigger than the Super Bowl. There\u2019s not many shows that can say that on planet Earth.",
      "DAVIES: It\u2019s enormous fun. It could be said if you\u2019ve never seen a single Eurovision Song Contest in your life, you can still come along and watch this. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019d have made up for a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d story anyway.",
      "One day I\u2019ll do that \u201cABBA Voyage\u201d story where the holograms come to life and start killing people. That\u2019s the best idea ever. We\u2019ve got to do that one then. Can you imagine? That would be just amazing. I think there might be some copyright problems with that but we\u2019d overcome them.",
      "The actual pitch for the story to Juno (Dawson), who wrote it, was Eurovision meets \u201cDie Hard.\u201d So as you will see, the moment it starts, there\u2019s trouble, someone\u2019s out to sabotage it. There are villains behind the scenes trying to disrupt the program. All chaos is let loose and the rest of the episode is spent saving people\u2019s lives after that.",
      "DAVIES: I think there\u2019s four songs in total (by Murray Gold). Obviously we don\u2019t get to all 40 planets with their songs, but it was a very big production. We had to hive this off into its own production unit. There are scenes in the television gallery, where 40 different monitors have output of 40 different screens. And that\u2019s all been fed in live. That\u2019s not done with green screen afterwards, that\u2019s all stuff they\u2019d already shot. Crowds, acts, rehearsals, backstage, presenters, all of that stuff, playing onto that set, so it\u2019s terribly complicated.",
      "DAVIES: Frankly, they\u2019re all expensive. It was a lot, yes. It had to be planned very far in advance, more than any. Once you plan something carefully, then it costs less just because you\u2019re not busking. We allocate each story more or less the same amount of money. So I think it ends up costing as much as the others, but it just looks so good because they had so much time to plan it.",
      "DAVIES: We never say that. I don\u2019t know why, but we just don\u2019t ever do it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell me. I\u2019d faint.",
      "DAVIES: Yes, I will be. This will be a great night. I always sit and watch \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m old-fashioned \u2014 on its old-fashioned BBC One transmission at 7 o\u2019clock at night.",
      "I know people who have Eurovision parties, which I\u2019ve never gone to actually. Look at my life, it\u2019s devoted to television. I can\u2019t bear other people talking over it. That would just be a nightmare. So I will be sitting in. I\u2019ll get some nice dinner. I\u2019ll be a very happy man.",
      "DAVIES: I would like to go on a date with the man from Cyprus (Theo Evan). He\u2019s beautiful. I do like the U.K. entry this year (\u201cWhat the Hell Just Happened?\u201d by Remember Monday). I have a theory it\u2019s being underestimated in Great Britain. Just because we\u2019re so used to losing. We\u2019ve won five times, everyone. But this country gets a bit cynical about Eurovision sometimes. But I love our song. I think it\u2019s got a very memorable chorus.",

      "CANNES, France -- The 78th Cannes Film Festival got underway Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of French Riviera frenzy. Here are five things to look for at this year\u2019s Cannes:",
      "It might still be springtime, but, make no mistake, multiple Oscar campaigns will be launched in Cannes.",
      "Recent Cannes editions have produced several best-picture winners, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d and this year\u2019s winner, \u201cAnora\u201d by Sean Baker. The sway Cannes has on the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has only grown in recent years as the academy has expanded its overseas membership \u2014 many of them European voters who closely follow the buzz in Cannes.",
      "At the Oscars in March, three Cannes entries \u2014 \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 were among the 10 best-picture nominees. Less heralded movies can also emerge. The Latvian animated charmer \u201cFlow\u201d premiered last year in Cannes before its upset win at the Oscars.",
      "Before we get to the Academy Awards, though, Cannes will hand out its own prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.",
      "Deliberations by the jury (headed this year by Juliette Binoche ) are held entirely in private, so predicting the Palme is no easier than it was guessing the next pope. That doesn\u2019t stop bookies from handicapping the race and plenty of guesswork up and down the Croisette.",
      "This year\u2019s competition lineup features two previous Palme winners in Julia Ducournau (who returns with \u201cAlpha,\u201d her follow-up to \u201cTitane\u201d) and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (two-time winners, back this year with \u201cThe Young Mother\u2019s Home\u201d).",
      "Some of the movies that could be in the mix include Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident\u201d and Mascha Schilinksi\u2019s \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Or it could be Chie Hayakawa\u2019s \u201cRenoir,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value\u201d or Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d Or it could be \u2026 well, you get the idea.",
      "Cannes has a power to burnish even the most established stars, and its red carpet will, for the next 10 days, host a nonstop parade of them. (And they will be clothed, as per Cannes\u2019 latest etiquette protocol.)",
      "Among those on tap are Tom Cruise with \u201cMission Impossible: Final Reckoning\u201d on Wednesday; Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d with Denzel Washington; Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d with a cast featuring Benicio Del Toro and Michael Cera; Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "O\u2019Connor also stars in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d scheduled as one of the festival\u2019s last premieres.",
      "Three stars are coming to Cannes with their first features behind the camera: Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d). All are premiering in the Cannes sidebar Un Certain Regard, which means they won\u2019t have quite the pressure of the competition lineup. But there\u2019s no calm or easygoing section of Cannes, and each could emerge from the festival either minted as a filmmaker or humbled by critics.",
      "While Cannes movie screens light up with films, deal making transpires along the Croisette. Cannes draws studios, producers and sales agents all on the hunt for acquisitions. But when U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that he wants to enact tariffs on films made outside the U.S., it threw a giant wrench in the border-crossing dealmaking that Cannes specializes in. Yet with little detail on any possible tariffs and widespread doubt over its feasibility, the buying and selling of movies might not be slowed.",

      "PARIS -- Kim Kardashian testified Tuesday that she feared she would be raped and killed during a 2016 armed robbery in Paris, describing the ordeal in stark, emotional terms.",
      "\u201cI was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\u201d Kardashian told a French court, recalling how one robber pulled her toward him while she was wearing only a bathrobe. \u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "It marked the first time Kardashian has confronted the men accused of tying her up at gunpoint in her hotel suite during Fashion Week and stealing more than $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Her appearance is the emotional peak of a trial that has gripped France and reignited global debates over celebrity, privacy, and digital-age exposure.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Kim Kardashian has arrived at a Paris courthouse to testify against the men accused of robbing her at gunpoint in 2016, an event that reshaped her life and redefined celebrity security in the age of social media.",
      "This will be the first time she has faced the alleged assailants since that night, when she begged for her life as masked men bound her with zip ties and stole over $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s appearance is expected to be the emotional centerpiece of a trial that has captivated France, where the suspects \u2014 mostly in their 60s and 70s \u2014 are nicknamed \u201cthe grandpa robbers.\u201d",
      "Authorities say the group tracked her via her Instagram posts. Two defendants have admitted being at the scene.",
      "Her lawyers say she is ready to confront those who attacked her, with dignity.",
      "Earlier, Kardashian 's childhood friend and then stylist told the court that she heard the celebrity beg for her life during the robbery that transformed the way the world viewed fame in the digital age.",
      "Simone Harouche, who was sharing their two-floor hotel suite during Fashion Week, said she heard a terrified Kardashian yelling: \u201c\u2018I have babies and I need to live.\u2019 That is what she kept on saying, \u2018Take everything. I need to live.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst,\u201d Harouche said. Kardashian was \u201cscreaming with terror in her voice.\u201d",
      "One of the most recognizable figures on the planet, Kardashian is set to face 10 men accused of orchestrating the heist \u2014 a crime that shook the fashion world and redefined the risks of being visible, female and famous in the Instagram era.",
      "Harouche told the court the trauma \u201cforever\u201d changed her friend, whom she\u2019s known since age 12, robbing her of a basic human right: freedom.",
      "\u201cShe now has a completely different lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of security, she can\u2019t go alone, she doesn\u2019t go alone to places anymore. To lose your sense of freedom ... it\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony is expected to recount how the attackers demanded her ring and left her fearing she would never see her children again.",
      "David De Pas, the lead judge, asked Harouche whether Kardashian had made herself a target by posting images of herself with \u201cjewels of great value.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Harouche replied. \u201cJust because a woman wears jewelry, that doesn\u2019t make her a target. That\u2019s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.\u201d",
      "Twelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. Another was excused due to illness. Most are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 nicknamed les papys braqueurs, or \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d \u2014 and authorities describe them as a seasoned and coordinated criminal gang.",
      "Two defendants have admitted being at the scene. The others deny involvement, and one claims he didn\u2019t know who Kardashian was. But police say the group tracked her via social media, where she had posted images of her jewelry, her hotel, and her schedule \u2014 exposing her vulnerability.",
      "The heist turned Kardashian into a cautionary tale of hyper-visibility. At the time, she was at the height of her influence \u2014 a style icon, social media pioneer and one of the most photographed women in the world.",
      "Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld criticized her after the robbery, telling The Associated Press she was \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth. Yet, as details emerged in the days after the heist, public sentiment shifted. The image of Kardashian \u2014 alone, bound, and pleading for her life \u2014 reframed her in the public eye.",
      "In the aftermath, Kardashian pulled back from the spotlight. She developed severe anxiety and later described symptoms of agoraphobia.",
      "\u201cI hated to go out,\u201d she said in a 2021 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to know where I was \u2026 I just had such anxiety.\u201d",
      "Later, she acknowledged that constant sharing had made her vulnerable: \u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Harouche, who hid in a downstairs bathroom during the robbery, said she also suffered trauma. She sought counseling for post-traumatic stress and left the celebrity styling world to become an interior designer.",
      "\u201cThat experience was very stressful for me. It made me fearful of being around celebrities,\" she said.",
      "Harouche said she went to bed before the robbery. Kardashian entertained friends upstairs. Screams jolted Harouche from her sleep.",
      "From inside the locked bathroom, she texted Kardashian\u2019s sister Kourtney and Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard that \u201csomething is very wrong,\u201d Harouche testified.",
      "Later, after the robbers had gone, she said she heard Kardashian hopping down the stairs with her ankles still bound to find her.",
      "\u201cShe was beside herself,\u201d Harouche said. \u201cShe just was screaming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021",
      "PARIS -- French movie star G\u00e9rard Depardieu on Tuesday was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court.",
      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d) in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cIt is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\u201d said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \u201cToday we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot like that.\u201d He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cnot credible\" and stressed both accusers' \u201cconstant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\u201d",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \u201caggressive\u201d defense strategy \u201cbased on comments meant to offend them.\u201d The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \u201cconsidered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \u201cin front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very moved,\" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that\u2019s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",
      "Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",
      "French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.",
      "The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.",
      "In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.",
      "A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.",
      "In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.",

      "\u201cIndeed last year was a beautiful year,\u201d Fr\u00e9maux said Monday. \u201cBut at the very time when I was with (journalists) as the festival started, we didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a good year or not.\u201d",
      "Cannes is kicking off the same day G\u00e9rard Depardieu, one of France\u2019s most famous actors, was found guilty of having sexually assaulted two women on a 2021 film set. In one of France\u2019s most prominent #MeToo cases, Depardieu was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The 76-year-old has long been a regular presence at Cannes.",
      "This year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, the premier international cinematic gathering, is also unspooling following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on movies made overseas. While Fr\u00e9maux expressed sympathy for the cause of strengthening local movie production, he said it was too soon to comment on the still-unformed plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too early in the game,\u201d said Fr\u00e9maux. \u201cBut if I say one thing here at the Cannes Film Festival, we wouldn\u2019t want the American cinema to cease to be strong. And right now, it\u2019s very strong.\u201d",
      "Cannes will follow up Tuesday\u2019s festivities with the return Wednesday of Tom Cruise to Cannes. Three years after he brought \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d to the festival, he\u2019s back with the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie.",
      "Twenty-two films will vie for Cannes\u2019 top prize, the Palme d\u2019Or. Those films include Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cNouvelle Vague,\u201d Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cAlpha\u201d and Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident.\u201d",
      "Binoche will be leading the jury that picks the Palme d\u2019Or winner, along with jurors including Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong. The festival closes May 24.",
      "In Cannes\u2019 Un Certain Regard section, three prominent actors are making their directorial debuts: Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d).",
      "Geopolitics are likely to play a starring role at Cannes, which is beginning by screening three 2025 Ukraine documentaries: \u201cZelensky,\u201d Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy\u2019s \u201cNotre Guerre\u201d and The Associated Press-Frontline coproduction \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d by \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d Oscar-winner Mstyslav Chernov.",
      "\u201cThis \u2018Ukraine Day\u2019 is a reminder of the commitment of artists, authors and journalists to tell the story of this conflict in the heart of Europe,\u201d the festival said in a statement.",
      "Cannes will also celebrate its opening by turning to an old favorite. A restoration of Charlie Chaplin's \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d is to debut Tuesday, timed to the film's centenary.",

      "Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC\u2019s action.",

      "Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added.",
      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world\u2019s largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping.",
      "It has been in the hot seat since 2022, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming stadium tour. The company said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",

      "The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world. Now, the festival has added a new stipulation: no nudity.",
      "While nudity was never previously endorsed at the festival, Cannes updated its dress policy on the eve of its 78th edition to read that \u201cnudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the festival.\u201d",
      "While a no-shirt-no-service policy is standard in places far less glamorous than Cannes, the policy tweak sparked widespread attention Monday because of the recent trend of sheer and \u201cnude dresses, \u201d such as Bianca Censori's Grammys appearance.",
      "Asked for clarity on the policy, Cannes press officers said the festival \u201cmade explicit in its charter certain rules that have long been in effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe aim is not to regulate attire per se, but to prohibit full nudity on the red carpet, in accordance with the institutional framework of the event and French law,\u201d it said.",
      "Cannes also noted that \u201cvoluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater are not permitted.\u201d",
      "Still, skin has often been flashed at the French Riviera festival by celebrities like Bella Hadid, Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner, and dress policies have long been flouted by celebrities. For evening premieres at the Palais' Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lumi\u00e8re, black tie and evening wear is required. Though not in recent years, Cannes security officials have sometimes turned away women for not wearing heels.",

      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government",
      "NEW YORK -- Poet Marie Howe, one of this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prize, says being a writer is often less a career than a vocation. You rely on teaching and other outside work and seek support from foundations or from a government agency, like the National Endowment for the Arts.",
      "\u201cEverybody applies for an NEA grant, year after after year, and if you get it, it's like wow \u2014 it's huge,\" says Howe, a Pulitzer winner for \u201cNew and Selected Poems\u201d and a former NEA creative writing fellow. \u201cIt's not just the money. It's also deep encouragement. I just felt so grateful. It made a big, big difference. It gives you courage. It says to you, \u2018Go on, keep doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government \u2014 the grants from the NEA or National Endowment for the Humanities that enable a writer to complete a book, a community theater to stage a play, a scholar to access archival documents or a museum to organize an exhibit.",
      "For decades, there has been a nationwide artistic and cultural infrastructure receiving bipartisan support, including through the first administration of Donald Trump.",
      "Now that is changing \u2014 and drastically.",
      "Since returning to office in January, the president has alleged that federal agencies and institutions such as the NEA, NEH, PBS, the Kennedy Center and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were advancing a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d that undermined traditional values.",
      "Trump has ousted leaders, cut or eliminated programs and dramatically shifted priorities: At the same time the NEH and NEA were forcing out staff members and canceling grants, they announced a multimillion-dollar initiative to support statues for Trump's proposed \"National Garden of American Heroes,\u201d from George Washington to Shirley Temple.",
      "\u201cAll future awards will, among other things, be merit-based, awarded to projects that do not promote extreme ideologies based upon race or gender, and that help to instill an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country,\" reads a statement on the NEH website.",
      "Individuals and organizations across the country, and across virtually every art form, now find themselves without money they had budgeted for or even spent, anticipating they would be reimbursed.",
      "Electric Literature, McSweeney's and n+1 are among dozens of literary publications that received notices their grants have been rescinded. Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library had to halt a project to create an online catalog after losing a near-$250,000 grant from the IMLS. The Stuttering Association for the Young, which manages a summer music camp, has a $35,000 gap.",
      "\u201cOur fundraising allows kids to attend our summer camp at a greatly reduced cost so the lost funds make it harder to fulfill that commitment,\" says the association's director, Russell Krumnow, who added that \u201cwe planned our programming and made decisions with those funds in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cGovernment money ought to be consistent. It ought to be reliable,\u201d says Talia Corren, co-executive director of the New York-based Alliance of Resident Theatres, which assists hundreds of nonprofit theater companies. \u201cYou need to make decisions based on that money.\u201d",
      "The NEA, NEH and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were among the institutions established 60 years ago, during the height of President Lyndon Johnson's \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. At various times, they have faced criticism for supporting provocative artists, such as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s. But they have endured, in part, because of their perceived economic benefits, distributed through as many congressional districts as possible.",
      "Arts advocates contend that, like other forms of federal aid, the importance of an NEA or NEH grant isn\u2019t just the initial money, but the \u201cripple\u201d or \u201cmutliplier\u201d effect. Government backing often carries the kind of prestige that makes a given organization more desirable to private donors.",
      "The millions of dollars channeled through state arts and humanities councils in turn support local projects. Funding for a theater production helps generate jobs for the cast and crew, brings in business for neighboring restaurants and bars and parking garages and spending money for the babysitter hired by parents having a night out.",
      "Actor Jane Alexander was just beginning her stage career when the endowment helped fund the 1967 Arena Stage production of Howard Sackler's drama about boxer Jack Johnson, \u201cThe Great White Hope,\" which starred Alexander and James Earl Jones and eventually won the Pulitzer Prize. Alexander, who headed the NEA in the 1990s, remembered how Arena co-founder Zelda Fichandler worried that the endowment might hurt business by supporting other theaters in Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd I remember my late husband (Robert Alexander) who was artistic director of the Living Stage Theatre Company at the time, saying to her, 'No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. A rising tide floats all boats,\" she says.",
      "In the short term, organizations are seeking donations from the general public and philanthropists are attempting to fill in fiscal holes. The Mellon Foundation recently announced an \u201cemergency\u201d $15 million fund for state humanities councils. At the Portland Playhouse in Oregon, artistic director Brian Weaver says that donors stepped in after the theater lost a $25,000 NEA grant just a day before they were to open a production of \u201cJoe Turner's Come and Gone,\u201d",
      "But Weaver and others say private fundraising alone isn't a long-term solution, if only because individuals incur \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d and philanthropists change their minds. Jane Alexander remembers when the Arena theater in Washington founded a repertory company, supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was like the National Theatre in Britain,\" she says. '\"We felt so proud that we can have a repertory company of 30 players rotating players through the season. It was very, very exciting. And we had, you know, voice lessons, we had fencing lessons. We were going to become the great company. And guess what happened? Rockefeller\u2019s priorities changed.\u201d",

      "No one on \u201cAndor\u201d undergoes more trauma than Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona.

      "Sharing online was second nature for Kim Kardashian, an extension of her fame",
      "PARIS -- The ring gleamed in Instagram posts. So did the diamond necklace and the luxury Paris address. For Kim Kardashian, sharing online was second nature, an extension of her fame. But in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, that openness was turned against her.",
      "Five masked men posing as police officers stormed the residence where she was staying during Fashion Week. They bound her with duct tape and plastic cable ties, locked her in the bathroom and fled with an estimated $6 million in stolen jewelry.",
      "The robbery sent shock waves far beyond Paris. It was the latest moment when celebrity exposure \u2014 fueled by social media updates and glamour on display \u2014 collided with real-world risk.",
      "The late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld offered a characteristically blunt assessment in the days that followed. Speaking to The Associated Press, he criticized Kardashian\u2019s hyper-visibility in an era when fame can come with serious vulnerabilities.",
      "\u201c(She is) too public, too public \u2014 we have to see in what time we live,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot display your wealth then be surprised that some people want to share it,\u201d he added, questioning why she was in a hotel with no security.",
      "On Tuesday, Kardashian takes the stand in a trial that began last month, nearly a decade after the robbery. She will finally face the men accused of carrying out one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history.",
      "What made the robbery extraordinary was not just its high-profile victim but how investigators believe she was targeted. Kardashian had posted real-time updates from her hotel suite. She showed off a 20-carat diamond ring, gifted by her then-husband Kanye West, hours before it was stripped from her hand.",
      "The attackers used no digital trackers or hacking tools. Instead, investigators believe they followed Kardashian\u2019s digital breadcrumbs \u2014 images, timestamps, geotags \u2014 and exploited them with old-school criminal methods.",
      "It was, some suggested at the time, a blueprint built from her own broadcast.",
      "The men dressed as police, spoke only French and overpowered the concierge, who was forced to act as a translator during the break-in.",
      "\u201cI thought it was terrorists,\u201d Kardashian later told a French magistrate in 2017. \u201cThat they were going to kill me.\u201d",
      "The robbery forced Kardashian to consider how she lived, posted and protected herself. Her brand had been built on access, her life broadcast to millions. But that strategy had collapsed.",
      "\u201cI learned to be more private,\u201d she later said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d",
      "Kardashian enhanced her security detail by hiring people with backgrounds in elite protective services, reportedly including former members of the U.S. Secret Service and CIA. She stopped posting her location in real time. Lavish gifts and jewelry all but vanished from her feed.",
      "\u201cI was definitely materialistic before \u2026 but I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me,\" she reflected on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017.",
      "Later, Kardashian acknowledged that constant sharing had made her a target.",
      "\u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Her retreat set off a ripple effect across Hollywood and the fashion world.",
      "Model Gigi Hadid increased her private security detail in the months after the heist. She was spotted at Paris fashion shows flanked by multiple guards. Kendall Jenner, Kardashian\u2019s sister, reportedly took similar steps ahead of the 2016 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show in Paris, following new protocols on personal protection and digital discretion. Publicists and managers began advising clients to delay posts, remove location tags and think twice before flashing luxury online.",
      "Visibility remained currency, but for some the rules had changed.",
      "Surveillance footage helped French police reconstruct the timeline of the robbery, but the breakthrough came from a trace of DNA left on the plastic ties used to bind Kardashian.",
      "It matched Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, a veteran criminal whose DNA was in the national database. Phone taps and surveillance led police to others, including Yunice Abbas and Didier Dubreucq, known as \u201cYeux bleus.\u201d Most of the accused have long criminal records.",
      "Abbas later claimed he was unaware of Kardashian\u2019s identity during the heist.",
      "But investigators say the men acted with detailed planning and discipline. Prepaid phones were activated the day before the heist and abandoned immediately afterward. But in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough.",
      "Kardashian, once mocked by some of the French press as a reality TV sideshow, is now at the center of a case with deep cultural resonance.",

      "Cibella also noted that although documents have indicated that Weinstein and Sokola knew each other by 2006, no witnesses or documents corroborate her account of meeting the then-influential movie producer four years earlier at a Manhattan nightclub. She was 16 at the time and alleges he first sexually assaulted her days after they met.",
      "Sokola is the second of three accusers to testify at Weinstein's rape and sexual assault retrial, and she's the only one who wasn\u2019t part of the onetime Hollywood honcho\u2019s first trial in 2020.",
      "Weinstein is being retried because an appeals court overturned his landmark #MeToo 2020 conviction, saying the judge at the time allowed prejudicial testimony. After the reversal, prosecutors added Sokola\u2019s allegation to the case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist who had a jet-setting modeling career as a teen. She testified earlier this week that Weinstein exploited her youthful interest in an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Another alleged incident, in 2006, is the basis for a criminal sex act charge against Weinstein. Sokola, who was 19 at the time, says he lured her to a hotel room by saying he had a script for her to see, then pinned her down on a bed and performed oral sex on her as she implored him not to.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Haley, Mann and Sokola have given their permission to be identified.",

      "Historian Ron Chernow\u2019s latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant",
      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century.",
      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",
      "De Niro is to receive the award in the festival's opening ceremony on May 13.",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted the defense lawyers' request to delay the last step in jury selection until Monday, when both sides will narrow down the pool of 45 people to 12 jurors and six alternates. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel.",
      "The defense said striking prospective jurors could take as little as 10 to 15 minutes, so why not do it on Monday when they will be present. The jurors weren\u2019t required to be in the Manhattan courtroom on Friday, but Combs was there.",
      "Prosecutors objected, saying the whole process could get gummed up if several jurors panic after being chosen and decide they don\u2019t want to take part in a high-profile trial that's expected to last two months.",
      "Would-be jurors were asked questions earlier this week to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts \u2014 even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. The process is expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers say prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors told the judge they'd seen the video and some were deemed too affected by it to be impartial.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",

I keep coming back.\u201d",
      "Though Daltrey didn\u2019t write songs, he was able to channel Townsend\u2019s many and complicated moods \u2014 defiance and rage, vulnerability and desperation.",

      "Pre-sales will run from May 13 ahead of the general sale beginning May 16.",

      "Kali Uchis wrote the album that she knew her future self would need to listen to",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kali Uchis wrote the album she knew her future self would need to listen to. The Grammy-winning artist unknowingly was crafting her own audible remedy.",
      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California's governor called upon the state's cities and counties to ban homeless encampments this week, even providing blueprint legislation for dismantling the tents lining streets, parks and waterways throughout much of the state.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, made homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019. It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",
      "Still, he has repeatedly called out cities and counties to do their part, and on Monday, he unveiled draft language that can be adopted by local governments to remove encampments. Here is what to know:",
      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "Here\u2019s what you need to know:",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",

      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",

      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",

      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",

      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "Cancer before age 50 is rare, but increasing, in the United States and researchers want to know why.",
      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",
      "Explanations will take more research. The big databases used for the study don't include information on risk factors or access to care. Theories abound and a big meeting is planned later this year to bring together experts in the area.",
      "\u201cSeveral of these cancer types are known to be associated with excess body weight and so one of the leading hypotheses is increasing rates of obesity,\u201d said lead author Meredith Shiels of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "Advances in cancer detection and changes in screening guidelines could be behind some early diagnoses.",
      "For breast cancer, the trend toward women having a first child at older ages is a possible explanation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are known to reduce risk.",
      "This isn't happening across the board. Cancer rates in people under 50 are going down for more than a dozen types of cancer, with the largest declines in lung and prostate cancers.",
      "Cigarette smoking has been declining for decades, which likely accounts for the drop in lung cancer among younger adults.",
      "The drop in prostate cancer is likely tied to updated guidelines discouraging routine PSA testing in younger men because of concerns about overtreatment.",

      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",

      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said. Thanks to the funds, Subianto said Biofarma, a state-run pharmaceutical company, now can produce two billion doses of its polio vaccine every year, benefiting more than 900 million people in 42 countries.",

      "BANGKOK -- Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.",
      "Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region\u2019s township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.",
      "The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military rule",
      "A member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.",
      "The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.",
      "Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People\u2019s Defense Forces. The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army\u2019s 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.",
      "A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.",
      "The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.",
      "About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village\u2019s clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.",
      "A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People\u2019s Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.",

Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law.\u201d",

      "Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar\u2019s devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.",

      "\u201cAs god is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,\" Myatt read from the statement. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me. I am not angry, I am not bitter.\"",
      "Sullivan, 68, was convicted in 1987 of killing Diane Sindall in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England. He spent 38 years behind bars.",
      "Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of fuel, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.",
      "Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.",

      "\u201cThe prosecution case is that it was one person. It was one person who carried out a sexual assault on the victim,\u201d Pitter said. \u201cThe evidence here is now that one person was not the defendant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson did not challenge the appeal and said that if the DNA evidence had been available at the time of the investigation it was inconceivable that Sullivan would have been prosecuted.",
      "Merseyside Police said it reopened the investigation as the appeal was underway and was \u201ccommitted to doing everything\u201d to find the killer.",
      "The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines possible wrongful convictions, had declined to refer Sullivan\u2019s case to the appeals court in 2008, and the court turned away his appeal in 2019.",
      "But the CCRC took up the case again when the new DNA evidence was available.",
      "\u201cIn the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellant\u2019s conviction as safe,\u201d Justice Timothy Holroyde said.",

      "The PKK, designated as a terrorist organization by several, announced the historic decision on Monday months after its imprisoned leader called for the group to formally disband and disarm \u2014 a move that could bring an end to one of the Middle East\u2019s longest-running insurgencies.",
      "In making the call, the PKK leader stressed the need for securing Kurdish rights through negotiation rather than armed struggle.",

Over time, it moderated its objectives toward autonomy and greater Kurdish rights within Turkey. The conflict, which has spilled into neighboring Iraq and Syria, has claimed tens of thousands of lives since it began in the 1980s.",
      "The latest peace effort, which the government has labeled \u201cTerror-Free Turkey\u201d was launched in October, after a key ally of President Recep Tayyip suggested parole for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan if the PKK renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Officials have not disclose details about the process that will follow the PKK\u2019s decision.",
      "Media close to the government have reported that the PKK\u2019s disarmament process is expected to take three to four months, with weapons being collected at designated locations in northern Iraq under official supervision.",

      "Erdogan said Monday the PKK\u2019s declaration should apply to all PKK-affiliated groups, including Kurdish groups in Syria.",
      "The Kurdish fighters in Syria have ties to the PKK and have been involved in intense fighting with Turkish-backed forces there. The leader of the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces previously said Ocalan\u2019s call for a dissolution does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "The group then reached an agreement with the central government in Damascus for a nationwide ceasefire and its merger into the Syrian army. Despite the deal, Kurdish officials in Syria later declared their desire for a federal state, sparking tensions with the Syrian government.",
      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan\u2019s government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",

      "Al-Sharaa took power after leading a lightning rebel offensive that unseated his predecessor, Bashar Assad, in December. Since then, he has positioned himself as a statesman aiming to unite and rebuild his country after nearly 14 years of civil war, but his past as a Sunni Islamist militant has left many \u2014 including Shiite groups in Iraq \u2014 wary.",

      "The clashes were the latest bout of violence in the largely lawless Mediterranean country, which has been plunged into chaos and division since 2011. Amid the chaos, militias grew in wealth and power, particularly in Tripoli and the western part of the country.",
      "Libya has been divided for years between rival administrations in the east and west, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments. Currently, it is governed by Dbeibah\u2019s government in the west and by the administration of Prime Minister Ossama Hammad in the east.",

      "A report from a London-based environmental group says illegal overfishing and destructive practices by foreign vessels are responsible for increased irregular migration to Spain from Senegal in West Africa",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Overfishing by foreign vessels is decimating fish stocks in the West African country of Senegal, which is in turn fueling migration to Spain, according to a report released Tuesday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said illegal overfishing and destructive practices by foreign vessels are responsible for increased irregular migration to Spain. It based its conclusions on interviews with fishermen in Spain and Senegal and its prior research on foreign overfishing.",
      "The group found that 57% of fish stocks in Senegal are in a \u201cstate of collapse,\u201d with foreign vessels playing a significant role in declining numbers. Its analysis showed 43.7% of licensed vessels in Senegal are foreign-controlled, predominantly of Spanish and Chinese origin.",
      "As fish populations dwindle, local fishermen are facing income loss, and many have turned to migration as a last resort. Fishing is an important economic sector in Senegal that employs 3% of the workforce.",
      "Irregular migration to the Canary Islands almost doubled in 2024, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry, reaching 46,843. While exact figures aren\u2019t known due to a lack of information on departures from West Africa, Senegal is one of the top three nationalities of arrivals to the Spanish islands.",
      "The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. The Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims were in the thousands last year.",
      "Migrants and former fishermen in the Canary Islands told the Environmental Justice Foundation that the treacherous journey to Spain was a last resort, a way to provide for families when fishing in Senegal could no longer put food on the table.",
      "\u201cIf I was able to gain enough money in fishing, I would never have come to Europe,\u201d said Memedou Racine Seck.",
      "Local activists in Senegal have voiced their frustration with foreign overfishing and its contribution to the migration crisis. Karim Sall, President of AGIRE, a Senegalese organization operating in the Joal-Fadiouth marine protected area, condemned foreign nations for their role in the crisis.",
      "\u201cI get so angry when (foreign nations) complain about immigration because they are the real pirates and what they did is worse than clandestine immigration. It\u2019s theft, plundering our resources to feed their own inhabitants while we suffer,\u201d said Sall.",
      "Industrial foreign fleets, many of which use bottom trawling techniques, are exacerbating the crisis. These vessels drag heavy nets across the seafloor, indiscriminately catching young fish and destroying marine ecosystems like seagrass and coral reefs, which are vital for fish reproduction. As a result, fish stocks are unable to recover, deepening the hardships of local fishing communities and eaters. Fish plays an important role in food security in Senegal, especially for protein consumption. Due to declining fish stocks, consumption per capita in Senegal has fallen from 29 kilograms per year to 17.8 kilograms per person.",
      "The report also pointed to a lack of transparency in fishing licenses and inadequate government management of fisheries as contributing factors. Despite efforts by the Senegalese government to address the crisis, experts warn that without stricter regulations on industrial foreign fleets, the situation will worsen.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization on Tuesday found Russia responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives more than a decade ago, in a ruling that raises the prospect of victims\u2019 families being paid compensation.",
      "A Dutch-led international investigation concluded in 2016 that the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur airliner was shot down on July 17, 2014, from Ukrainian territory held by separatist rebels using a Buk missile system delivered from Russia. Moscow denies any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.",
      "The Netherlands and Australian governments brought the case against Moscow before the Montreal-based global aviation agency in 2022, and on Tuesday welcomed the verdict.",
      "The International Court of Justice wasn't an option, because Russia doesn't recognize The Hague, Netherlands-based court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
      "The council found that Russia had violated the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, which requires that states \u201crefrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.\u201d",
      "It's the first time that the council, which represents 193 member states, has decided a dispute between governments.",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said that the council would consider the question of reparations within weeks.",
      "\u201cIn that context, the Netherlands and Australia are requesting that the ICAO Council order the Russian Federation to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands and Australia, and that the Council facilitate this process,\u201d Veldkamp said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe latter is important in order to ensure that the negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to specific timelines, and that they will yield actual results,\u201d he added.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged the council to move swiftly to \u201cdetermine remedies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe call on Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for its horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,\u201d Wong said in a statement.",
      "The Russian Embassy in Australia didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "Australian National University international law expert Don Rothwell said that the council had yet to publish the reasons for its decisions.",
      "\u201cOne of the consequences for this process will be that the council will probably make some recommendations that Russia pay what are called reparations, which is an international term for damages, as a result of its violation of international law,\u201d Rothwell said.",
      "\u201cSo we have to wait and see exactly what the council finds on that particular point,\u201d Rothwell added.",

    "story": [
      "In Senegal\u2019s gold-rich Kedougou region, women and children face serious health risks from mercury exposure used in gold processing",
      "KEDOUGOU, Senegal -- The quickest way to separate gold from rock, Sadio Camara says, is with a drop of mercury. She empties a dime-sized packet of the silvery liquid into a plastic bucket of muddy sediment outside her home in southeastern Senegal. With bare hands and no mask, she swirls the mixture as her children look on.",
      "\u201cI know mercury isn\u2019t good for your health \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink the water it comes into contact with,\u201d she said. \u201cI only process small amounts of gold, so there\u2019s no danger.\u201d",
      "But even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks.",
      "Across West Africa, mercury \u2014 a potent neurotoxin \u2014 remains the dominant method for extracting gold from ore in the region\u2019s booming informal mining sector, much of it illegal and unregulated. In Senegal\u2019s gold-rich Kedougou region, women like Camara use the metal regularly, often without protective gloves and masks, to make a living.",
      "Mercury exposure can cause irreversible brain damage, developmental delays, tremors and loss of vision, hearing and coordination. Once released, it spreads easily through air, water and soil. Particularly after heavy rains, it contaminates rivers, poisons fish and accumulates up the food chain.",
      "A 2018 Duke University-led study found mercury levels in soils, sediments and water near artisanal gold mining villages in southeastern Senegal that exceeded safety thresholds set by the World Health Organization and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by 10 to 100 times.",
      "In artisanal mining, mercury is prized for its ability to bind quickly and easily to gold. Miners mix the liquid metal into crushed ore, and the mixture is then heated \u2014 often over open flames \u2014 to evaporate the mercury and leave behind a lump of gold. The process is cheap, effective and dangerous.",
      "\u201cIf it hurt right away, like a knife, people would stop. But the issue is that it takes years for the dangers to manifest,\u201d said Doudou Dram\u00e9, president of the Observatoire Territoriale du Secteur Extractif, an organization that advocates for safer conditions for gold miners in Kedougou. \u201cPeople are dumping it directly into the river. They\u2019re burning it in the open, releasing toxic smoke into the air. It\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining is the largest global source of mercury emissions, even more than the burning of coal, according to the UN Environment Programme. In Senegal alone, artisanal mines are estimated to release between 12 and 16 metric tons of mercury each year.",
      "\u201cKedougou has rich land \u2014 very rich land,\u201d Dram\u00e9 said. \u201cNow mercury is everywhere. Our animals consume it, and it comes back to us. Even the soil is no longer fertile.\u201d",
      "Along the muddy banks of a rust-colored pond, dozens of women wade knee-deep as they rinse piles of sediment in search of gold. Children dart between mounds of earth while the runoff pools around their feet. With little access to clean water, many women spend long hours in local waterways to work, bathe their children, wash clothes and clean dishes.",
      "\u201cWomen are much more exposed than men,\u201d said Modou Goumbala, the monitoring and evaluation manager at La Lumiere, an NGO that supports community development in southeastern Senegal.",
      "That exposure can be especially dangerous for pregnant and nursing women. Mercury can cross the placenta, putting fetuses at risk of developmental delays and birth defects. Infants may also absorb the toxin through contaminated breast milk.",
      "Inside her kitchen hut not far from the stream, Camara heats a nugget of mercury-laced sediment with a metal spoon over an open flame. The toxic metal evaporates and leaves behind a kernel of gold. There\u2019s no mask, no gloves \u2014 just the raw materials and her bare hands. Her children stand just a few feet away, watching and breathing the fumes.",
      "Camara said she doesn\u2019t usually handle the burning herself; that task is typically left to men. But she and other women regularly mix and shape the mercury amalgam with no protection. One of her children suffers from frequent stomachaches, though she hasn\u2019t noticed any other symptoms. Still, the risks loom.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to earn money today is gold mining,\u201d Camara said. \u201cSubsistence agriculture will not provide you enough for food or other needs.\u201d",
      "In Senegal, gold processors like Camara typically process between 5 and 10 grams of gold per month, earning the equivalent of $370 to $745 \u2014 more than double the national average salary of about $200.",
      "Senegal ratified the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2016, pledging to reduce mercury use and pollution. But the substance remains widely accessible. Most of the country\u2019s supply comes from Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana, with smaller amounts smuggled from dental clinics in Dakar, according to a 2022 report by the Institute for Security Studies.",
      "In 2020, the government promised to build 400 mercury-free gold processing units. So far, only one has been constructed \u2014 in Bantaco, about 15 miles from Camara\u2019s home. The facility uses gravity to separate gold from ore, eliminating the need for mercury by relying on sluices and shaking tables.",
      "During a recent visit, the rusting slab of metal sat unused beneath a corrugated roof.",
      "\u201cPeople used it for a while, but then they stopped, because one single unit can\u2019t cover an entire community,\u201d Goumbala said. \u201cNaturally, those who were nearby could use it. But for those who are very far away, they can\u2019t afford to transport the ore all the way, process it and then go back. It\u2019s extra work. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Camara said she tried the unit, but in addition to being far away, it was less effective at isolating gold \u2013 some was lost in the process.",
      "Repeated efforts to schedule an interview with Senegal\u2019s director of artisanal and small-scale mining were unsuccessful. The director later said the department had been suspended. He did not provide a reason.",
      "Senegal swore in a new president in 2024, but residents say the problems remain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new administration in place, but promises are still just promises,\u201d Goumbala said. He believes the lack of progress is due to limited funding.",
      "In an effort to curb pollution, authorities temporarily suspended mining within 500 meters (1,640 feet)of the Faleme River, which cuts through Senegal\u2019s gold belt and forms part of the border with Mali.",
      "But enforcement is weak as officials struggle to stem the influx of informal miners, many of whom arrive from neighboring countries. Critics say the measure barely scratches the surface of the problem.",
      "\u201cThe solution is to install the gold processing units within the communities \u2014 at least one per village,\u201d Goumbala said.",
      "Even so, he acknowledged the challenges: The machines are expensive, difficult to maintain and require replacement parts that are only available abroad.",
      "There\u2019s also resistance among miners, who say mercury is more efficient and profitable.",
      "\u201cWe need to convince communities that even if they make more money using mercury, in the end, they\u2019ll spend that profit on treating illnesses caused by it,\u201d Goumbala said. \u201cThe long-term consequences are far worse.\u201d",

      "A leading economist has been telling EU finance ministers that Russia\u2019s economy is under growing strain as its invasion of Ukraine drags on",
      "BRUSSELS -- Russia\u2019s economy is under growing strain as its invasion of Ukraine drags on and Western sanctions are undermining President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to sustain his war, a leading European economist said after briefing finance ministers on Tuesday.",
      "The economist, Torbj\u00f6rn Becker, Director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, warned that should Russia prevail, European Union governments would have to spend 2-3 times more than they currently do on defense for several years.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cfinancial system, their macroeconomic performance, is under pressure. It\u2019s not in balance. Risks are mounting. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we can sit back and relax,\u201d Becker told reporters at EU headquarters in Brussels.",
      "He spoke after briefing the bloc\u2019s finance ministers to help provide a picture of \u201cthe actual condition of Russia\u2019s economy, which significantly contrasts with the narrative promoted by Russian propaganda,\u201d the EU\u2019s Polish presidency said.",
      "It said that discussion would help \u201cus to better shape punitive, financial and economic sanctions against Russia.\u201d",
      "Becker said Russia\u2019s economy only accounts for about 12% of the economies of the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. He underlined that it is highly dependent on oil and natural gas revenue, and on imports of high-tech equipment to sustain the war effort.",
      "Still, Russia\u2019s economy has outperformed predictions. High defense spending has propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation. At the same time, wages have gone up to keep pace with inflation, leaving many workers better off.",
      "Large recruiting bonuses for military enlistees and death benefits for those killed in Ukraine have also put more income into the country\u2019s poorer regions.",
      "Over the long term, inflation and a lack of foreign investments remain threats to the economy. The question is how long Russia\u2019s militarized economy can keep going before those issues bite and whether it can hold out for longer than Ukraine and its Western backers.",
      "To hit its economy harder, EU envoys have drafted a new set of sanctions that would target more ships in the shadow fleet of tankers that Russia has deployed to evade a price cap of $60 per barrel imposed on Russian oil by the Group of 7 democracies.",
      "They could also freeze the assets of the Nord Stream II gas pipeline consortium. The pipeline is not in use, but the EU believes the move could help to discourage investment. The sanctions could enter force as soon as Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf we can lower oil prices and gas revenues and put tighter sanctions on what they can import, that\u2019s great,\u201d Becker said. He said U.S. President Donald Trump should press \u201cChina and India about what they are paying for and what they\u2019re exporting to Russia.\u201d",
      "Russia found new markets for its oil in India and China after the EU imposed a near-total ban and continues to earn a substantial part of government revenues from exports of oil and gas.",
      "Becker also urged Trump to hit Russia\u2019s financial system by restricting international transactions. \u201cIf something ruins an economy pretty quickly, it\u2019s a banking crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "In a recent report, his institute said that Russia\u2019s oil revenues decreased dramatically in early 2025, notably due to EU and G7 sanctions on the ghost fleet. This has forced Russia to withdraw from its sovereign wealth fund.",
      "The institute estimates that the liquid part of the fund is now equivalent to less than 3% of GDP. \u201cIf oil prices stay as they are, they will certainly run out of these funds in a year,\u201d Becker said.",

      "A U.S. budget airline has begun making deportation flights out of an Arizona airport, an unusual and controversial move for a company that depends heavily on its consumer brand",
      "PHOENIX -- A budget airline that serves mostly small U.S. cities began federal deportation flights Monday out of Arizona, a move that's inspired an online boycott petition and sharp criticism from the union representing the carrier\u2019s flight attendants.",
      "Avelo Airlines announced in April it had signed an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to make charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport outside Phoenix. It said it will use three Boeing 737-800 planes for the flights.",
      "The Houston-based airline is among a host of companies seeking to cash in on President Donald Trump's campaign for mass deportations.",
      "Congressional deliberations began last month on a tax bill with a goal of funding, in part, the removal of 1 million immigrants annually and housing 100,000 people in U.S. detention centers. The GOP plan calls for hiring 10,000 more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "Avelo was launched in 2021 as COVID-19 still raged and billions of taxpayer dollars were propping up big airlines. It saves money mainly by flying older Boeing 737 jets that can be bought at relatively low prices. And it operates out of less-crowded and less-costly secondary airports, flying routes that are ignored by the big airlines. It said it had its first profitable quarter in late 2023.",
      "Andrew Levy, Avelo's founder and chief executive, said in announcing the agreement last month that the airline's work for ICE would help the company expand and protect jobs.",
      "\u201cWe realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" said Levy, an airline industry veteran with previous stints as a senior executive at United and Allegiant airlines.",
      "Avelo did not grant an interview request from The Associated Press.",
      "Financial and other details of the Avelo agreement \u2014 including destinations of the deportation flights \u2014 haven\u2019t publicly surfaced. The AP asked Avelo and ICE for a copy of the agreement, but neither provided the document. The airline said it wasn\u2019t authorized to release the contract.",
      "Several consumer brands have shunned being associated with deportations, a highly volatile issue that could drive away customers. During Trump's first term, authorities housed migrant children in hotels, prompting some hotel chains to say that they wouldn't participate.",
      "Many companies in the deportation business, such as detention center providers The Geo Group and Core Civic, rely little on consumer branding. Not Avelo, whose move inspired the boycott petition on change.org and drew criticism from the carrier's flight attendants union, which cited the difficulty of evacuating deportees from an aircraft in an emergency within the federal standard of 90 seconds or less.",
      "\u201cHaving an entire flight of people handcuffed and shackled would hinder any evacuation and risk injury or death,\u201d the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said in a statement. \u201cIt also impedes our ability to respond to a medical emergency, fire on board, decompression, etc. We cannot do our jobs in these conditions.\u201d",
      "In New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo flies out of Tweed New Haven Airport, Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker urged Avelo\u2019s CEO to reconsider. \u201cFor a company that champions themselves as \u2018New Haven\u2019s hometown airline,\u2019 this business decision is antithetical to New Haven\u2019s values,\u201d Elicker said in a statement.",
      "Protests were held outside airports in Arizona and Connecticut on Monday.",
      "In Mesa, over 30 protesters gathered on a road leading up to the airport, holding signs that denounced Trump\u2019s deportation efforts. In Connecticut, about 150 people assembled outside Tweed New Haven Airport, calling on travelers to boycott Avelo.",
      "John Jairo Lugo, co-founder and community organizing director of Unidad Latina en Acci\u00f3n in New Haven, said protesters hope to create a financial incentive for Avelo to back out of its work for the federal government.",
      "\u201cWe need to cause some economical damage to the company to really convince them that they should be on the side with the people and not with the government,\u201d Lugo said.",
      "Mesa, a Phoenix suburb with about 500,000 people, is one of five hubs for ICE Air, the immigration agency's air transport operation for deportations. ICE Air operated nearly 8,000 flights in a 12-month period through April, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border.",
      "ICE contracts with an air broker, CSI Aviation, that hires two charter carriers -- GlobalX and Eastern Air Express -- to do most of the flights, said Tom Cartwright, who tracks flight data for Witness at the Border.",
      "Cartwright said it was unusual in recent years for commercial passenger carriers to carry out deportation flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been with an air broker who then hires the carriers, and the carriers have not been regular commercial carriers, or what I call retail carriers, who are selling their own tickets,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cAt least since I have been involved (in tracking ICE flights), they\u2019ve all been charter companies.\u201d",
      "Avelo will be a sub-carrier under a contract held by New Mexico-based CSI Aviation, which didn\u2019t respond to questions about how much money Avelo would make under the agreement.",
      "Avelo provides passenger service to more than 50 cities in the U.S., as well as locations in Jamaica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Avelo does not operate regular commercial passenger service out of Mesa Gateway Airport, said airport spokesman Ryan Smith.",
      "In February 2024, Avelo said it had its first profitable quarter, though it didn't provide details. In an interview two months later with the AP, Levy declined to provide numbers, saying the airline was a private company and had no need to provide that information publicly. ___ Associated Press writer Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a new software update prevented a third radar outage over the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend",
      "A new software update prevented a third radar outage in the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday.",
      "At a news conference, Duffy also said the recent problems that have led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in Newark could have been avoided had action been taken by President Joe Biden's administration to better equip the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia \u2014 particularly after issues with the hardware in October and November that should have set off alarms.",
      "Duffy said the update the Federal Aviation Administration installed Friday night helped ensure the backup system worked on Sunday when there was another problem with the primary line coming into the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia. When a similar issue happened Friday and on April 28, the radar and communications systems went offline briefly, leaving controllers unable to see or talk to the planes.",
      "The FAA restricted traffic into Newark Liberty International Airport after the first incident, partly because several air traffic controllers went out on trauma leave afterward, worsening the already short staffing. Those limits, designed to keep flights safe, combined with an ongoing runway construction project in Newark, led to all the cancellations and delays. Later this week, the FAA will meet with all the airlines to discuss making those limits last into the summer.",
      "Even though the radar system stayed online Sunday, controllers were worried because of the two previous outages, so Duffy said they stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution.",
      "Duffy said he will request an investigation into last year's move of Newark air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia to determine why more wasn't done to ensure there wouldn't be problems. Philadelphia is about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Newark.",
      "\u201cThe Biden-Buttigieg FAA bungled this move without properly hardening the telecom lines feeding the data, which was already well-known to be error-prone,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWithout addressing the underlying infrastructure, they added more risk to the system.\u201d",
      "Duffy also said the FAA should have set up a new radar system for Newark in Philadelphia instead of piping the signal in from New York for controllers.",
      "Duffy and President Donald Trump have said that the problems in Newark are a prime example of why they developed a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul that nation's air traffic control system, unveiled last week. Duffy blames the Biden administration for failing to do that, but those problems go back decades, even before the first Trump administration.",
      "An advisor to former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Duffy should spend more time trying to deal with the nation's problems, and he defended the Biden administration's efforts to bolster air traffic controller hiring and make a down payment on dealing with some of the infrastructure problems.",
      "\u201cSecretary Duffy has a tough job. But he needs to spend more time doing what the American people are paying him to do \u2014 fix problems \u2014 and less time blaming others,\" said Chris Meagher.",
      "Duffy laid out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system last week, including installing 4,600 new high-speed data connections and replacing 618 radars, but didn't put a price tag on the plan other than to say it will cost billions.",
      "The FAA has installed new fiber optic lines at Newark airport and New York's Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports to replace old copper wires since the first outage, but plans to spend the next two weeks testing those new lines out before switching over to them.",

      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to lower its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods by 115 percentage points, while China agreed to lower its retaliatory 125% rate on U.S. goods by the same amount. The two sides plan to continue negotiations on a longer-term trade deal.",

      "Jeremy Rice, the co-owner of a Lexington, Kentucky, home-d\u00e9cor shop that specializes in artificial flower arrangements, said the limited pause makes him unsure how to approach pricing.

      "\u201cOur vendors are still kind of running around juggling, not knowing what they\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe ordered in what we could pre-tariff and so there\u2019s stock here, but we\u2019re getting to the point now where there\u2019s things that are gone and we\u2019re going to have to figure out how we\u2019re gonna approach it.\u201d",

      "Before Trump started the latest U.S. tariff battle with China, Miami-based game company All Things Equal was preparing to launch its first electronic board game. Founder Eric Poses said he spent two years developing The Good News Is..., a fill-in-the-blank game covering topics like politics and sports. He plowed $120,000 into research and development.",
      "When the president in February added a 20% tariff on products made in China, Poses started removing unessential features such as embossed packaging. When the rate went up to 145%, he faced two options: leave the goods in China or send them to bonded warehouses, a storage method which allow importers to defer duty payments for up to five years.",
      "Poses contacted his factories in China on Monday to arrange the deferred shipments, but with his games still subject to a 30% tariff, he said he would have to cut back on marketing to keep the electronic game priced at $29.99. With other businesses also in a rush to get their products, he said he is worried he won't be able to his into shipping containers and that if he does, the cost will be much more expensive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to plan because if you want to go back to production in a couple of months, then you\u2019re worried about what will the tariff rate be when it hits the U.S. ports after that 90-day period,\u201d Poses said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",

    "story": [
      "House Republicans have unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump's \u201c big, beautiful bill \u201d late Sunday, at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks.",
      "Tallying hundreds of pages, the legislation is touching off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump's first term in 2017 \u2014 which ended in failure.",
      "While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "\u201cSavings like these allow us to use this bill to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep Republicans\u2019 promise to hardworking middle-class families,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles health care spending.",
      "But Democrats said the cuts are \u201cshameful\u201d and essentially amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare.",
      "\u201cIn no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel. He said \"hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.\"",
      "As Republicans race toward House Speaker Mike Johnson's Memorial Day deadline to pass Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, they are preparing to flood the zone with round-the-clock public hearings this week on various sections before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.",
      "The politics ahead are uncertain. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that residents back home depend on. Trump himself has shied away from a repeat of his first term, vowing there will be no cuts to Medicaid.",
      "All told, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package as Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the 2017 tax breaks, which were approved during Trump\u2019s first term and are expiring at the end of the year.",
      "But the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee has been among the most watched. The committee was instructed to come up with $880 billion in savings and reached that goal, primarily with the health care cuts, but also by rolling back Biden-era green energy programs. The preliminary CBO analysis said the committee's proposals would reduce the deficit by $912 billion over the decade \u2014 with at least $715 billion coming from the health provisions.",
      "Central to the savings are changes to Medicaid, which provides almost free health care to more than 70 million Americans, and the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded in the 15 years since it was first approved to cover millions more.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. People would also have to verify their eligibility to be in the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "This is likely to lead to more churn in the program and present hurdles for people to stay covered, especially if they have to drive far to a local benefits office to verify their income in person. But Republicans say it\u2019ll ensure that the program is administered to those who qualify for it.",
      "Many states have expanded their Medicaid rosters thanks to federal incentives, but the legislation would cut a 5% boost that was put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal funding to the states for immigrants who have not shown proof of citizenship would be prohibited.",
      "There would be a freeze on the so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that creates abuse in the system.",
      "The energy portions of the legislation run far fewer pages, but include rollbacks of climate-change strategies President Joe Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "It proposes rescinding funds for a range of energy loans and investment programs while providing expedited permitting for natural gas development and oil pipelines.",

      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an executive order that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he'll sign an executive order on Monday that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications \u2014 reviving a failed effort from his first term on an issue he's talked up since even before becoming president.",
      "The order Trump is promising will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the president posted Sunday on his social media site, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "His proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring significant savings to the government, although the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post may be an exaggeration.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "Under the planned order, the federal government would tie what it pays pharmaceutical companies for those drugs to the price paid by a group of other, economically advanced countries \u2014 the so-called \u201cmost favored nation\" approach.",
      "The proposal will face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "It was a rule that Trump tried to adopt during his first term, but could never get through. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under the Biden administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",
      "Only drugs on Medicare Part B \u2014 the insurance for doctor's office visits \u2014 are likely to be covered under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor's visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump's post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn't related to trade or the tariffs he has announced imposing on much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies' powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to do the right thing,\u201d he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A new study shows that people Zepbound lost about 50% more weight than those using Wegovy",
      "People taking Eli Lilly's obesity drug, Zepbound, lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in the first head-to-head study of the blockbuster medications.",
      "Clinical trial participants who took tirzepatide, the drug sold as Zepbound, lost an average of 50 pounds (22.8 kilograms) over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). That's according to the study funded by Lilly, which was published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Both drugs are part of a new class of medications that work by mimicking hormones in the gut and brain that regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. But tirzepatide targets two such hormones, known as GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets GLP-1 alone, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.",
      "\u201cTwo drugs together can produce better weight loss,\u201d said Aronne, who led the study and presented the findings Sunday at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain.",
      "While tirzepatide won out in what Aronne said many view as \u201ca drag race of efficacy,\u201d both are important tools for treating obesity, which affects about 40% of American adults.",
      "\u201cThe point of these medications is to improve health,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people won't need the most effective medication.\u201d",
      "The trial included 751 people from across the U.S. who were overweight or had obesity and at least one other weight-related health problem, but not diabetes. Participants received weekly injections of the highest tolerated doses of Zepbound, either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or Wegovy, 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams.",
      "By the end of the trial, those who took Zepbound lost about 20% of their body weight on average, compared with a nearly 14% loss for those who took Wegovy. The tirzepatide group trimmed about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) from their waist circumference, compared to about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) with semaglutide. In addition, nearly 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy, the study found.",
      "Weight loss was about 6% lower in men than in women in both groups, the authors noted. As participants in both groups lost more weight, they saw improvements in health markers such as blood pressure, blood fat and blood sugar levels.",
      "More than three-quarters of patients taking both drugs reported at least one side effect, mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. About 6% of participants taking Zepbound left the trial because of adverse events, compared with 8% of those taking semaglutide.",
      "The GLP-1 drugs have become increasingly popular, with at least 1 in 8 U.S. adults reporting their use, according to a 2024 survey by KFF, a independent health policy research organization. Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in global sales last year. Wegovy brought in nearly $8.8 billion (58.2 billlion Danish kroner).",
      "Access and affordability have limited wider use of the drugs. Tirzepatide and semaglutide were removed recently from a list of drug shortages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both manufacturers recently released programs that cut costs to about $500 per month or less, depending on the dose.",
      "Other factors can affect access. This week, CVS Health said Wegovy will become the preferred option on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "It's important to have a range of drugs to treat a disease as widespread as obesity in the U.S., said Dr. Angela Fitch, chief medical officer of knownwell, an obesity care company. Wegovy has been found to cut the risk of serious heart problems by 20%, she noted. A drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.",
      "\u201cWe're going to need to use them all just because we have so many patients who need treatment,\u201d she added.",

      "Fresh & Ready voluntarily recalled several products, which can be identified by \u201cuse by\u201d dates ranging from April 22 to May 19 of this year under the brand names Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away.",

      "A global trade war is offering Puerto Rico hope as the island attempts to strengthen its fragile economy",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A global trade war is offering Puerto Rico hope as the U.S. territory attempts to strengthen its fragile economy.",
      "Government officials are jumping on planes to try and convince international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, where they would be exempt from tariffs.",
      "Any relocation would be a boost to Puerto Rico\u2019s shaky economy as the government emerges from a historic bankruptcy and continues to struggle with chronic power outages. The island also is bracing for potentially big cuts in federal funding under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, with federal funds currently representing more than half of Puerto Rico\u2019s budget.",
      "\u201cThe tariff issue is a controversial one, but for Puerto Rico, it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d said Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "Manufacturing remains the island\u2019s biggest industry, representing nearly half of its gross domestic product. But the government wants to recapture Puerto Rico\u2019s heyday, when dozens of big-name companies, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, were based here and kept the economy humming.",
      "So far, officials have identified between 75 to 100 companies that might consider relocating operations to Puerto Rico given the ongoing trade war, said Ella Woger Nieves, CEO of Invest Puerto Rico, a public-private partnership that promotes the island as a business and investment destination.",
      "The companies identified work in sectors including aerospace, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.",
      "Officials also have welcomed site selectors to Puerto Rico and organized tours to show them the island\u2019s available infrastructure and stress how tariffs wouldn\u2019t apply here.",
      "\u201cThis is the moment to plant those seeds,\u201d Woger Nieves said.",
      "She said officials with Invest Puerto Rico and various government agencies are expected to make almost 20 more trips this year in a bid to attract more manufacturing to the island. The government praised an executive order that Trump signed Monday that aims to reduce the time it takes to approve construction of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the U.S.",
      "In the mid-1900s, needlework was one of Puerto Rico\u2019s largest industries, employing about 7,000 workers who labored on handkerchiefs, underwear, bedspreads and other items, according to a 1934 fair competition code signed by President Theodore Roosevelt.",
      "Manufacturing later shifted to chemicals, clothes and electronics. By the late 1970s, a growing number of pharmaceutical companies began moving their operations to Puerto Rico, lured by a federal tax incentive created in 1976 to help boost the island\u2019s economic growth. However, in 1996, the U.S. government began phasing out the incentive, which exempted the subsidiaries of U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico from federal taxes on local profits.",
      "From 1995 to 2005, overall manufacturing employment fell by nearly 30%, but employment in the sectors of pharmaceuticals, medicines and chemicals increased by at least 10%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Puerto Rico continues to lead U.S. exports of pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, representing nearly 20% of total U.S. exports in 2020, according to the bureau.",
      "In 2024, the island exported nearly $25 billion worth of goods, including $11 billion worth of vaccines and certain cultures; $7 billion worth of packaged medicaments; $1 billion worth of hormones; $984 million worth of orthopedic items; and $625 million worth of medical instruments, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.",
      "Sergio Marxuach, policy director and general counsel for the Center for a New Economy, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank, said the push to attract more companies makes sense, especially recruiting those in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors.",
      "\u201cIf I were advising the government, begin there because you already have a footprint,\u201d he said.",
      "Marxuach noted that outside of those areas, Puerto Rico could have an advantage when it comes to national defense and security contracts, including the manufacturing of drones or underwater surveillance systems.",
      "\u201cThey need a place to manufacture in scale,\u201d he said, adding that doing so in a U.S. jurisdiction is key.",
      "Puerto Rico\u2019s government also is meeting with university officials to potentially change curriculums if needed to ensure students are graduating with the skills required by companies.",
      "Puerto Rico touts its U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives and skilled workforce as reasons international companies should relocate to the island.",
      "But it cannot escape its well-known energy problems.",
      "Chronic power outages continue to plague Puerto Rico, with two island-wide blackouts occurring on Dec. 31 and April 16.",
      "Crews are still repairing the power grid after it was razed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already fragile following a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico needs more reliable energy for the economic growth to improve,\u201d said Robert F. Mujica, executive director of a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",
      "Woger Nieves, the CEO of Invest Puerto Rico, said that when officials meet with company leaders, they explain the state of the island\u2019s energy infrastructure and offer alternatives including cogeneration and renewables.",
      "\u201cPower doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be an impediment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marxuach, with the Center for a New Economy, said Puerto Rico\u2019s energy system is costly and inefficient, and noted that alternatives can be expensive.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has to address some issues that actually create additional costs for investors to come here,\u201d he said.",
      "One those costs is that any goods sent to the U.S. from Puerto Rico must by law be sent aboard a U.S.-flagged vessel with a U.S. crew.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of the Newark Liberty International Airport for the \u201cnext several weeks,\u201d as New Jersey\u2019s largest airport struggles with radar outages and numerous flight delays and c...",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of the Newark Liberty International Airport for the \u201cnext several weeks,\u201d as New Jersey's largest airport struggles with radar outages and numerous flight delays and cancellations due to a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "Speaking on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Duffy said he will convene a meeting with all the airlines flying out of Newark this week to determine the reduction, adding that it will fluctuate, with a larger reduction coming in the afternoons when international flight arrivals make the airport busier.",
      "\u201cWe want to have a number of flights that if you book your flight, you know it\u2019s going to fly, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the priority. So you don\u2019t get to the airport, wait four hours, and then get delayed.\u201d",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday, similar to an April 28 incident.",
      "There has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.",
      "The Trump administration proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the U.S. air traffic control system Thursday that includes six new air traffic control centers and technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation\u2019s air traffic facilities over the next three or four years.",
      "Duffy said Sunday that he also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61, as he tries to navigate a shortage of about 3,000 people in that specialized position.",
      "He plans to give those air traffic controllers a 20% upfront bonus to stay on the job. However, he says many air traffic controllers choose to retire after 25 years of service, which means many retire around the age of 50.",
      "\u201cThese are not overnight fixes,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cBut as we go up \u2014 one, two years, older guys on the job, younger guys coming in, men and women \u2014 we can make up that 3,000-person difference.\u201d",
      "Adding more air traffic controllers is in contrast to a top priority of the Trump administration \u2014 slashing jobs in nearly all other federal agencies. However, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Duffy deserves credit for putting \u201ccaution tape\u201d around FAA safety functions and separating those personnel from DOGE cost-cutting.",
      "Kirby said United has already reduced its schedule at Newark, and will meet with Duffy later this week. He expects a deeper cut in capacity to last until June 15 when construction to one of Newark's runways is expected to be complete, though he thinks some reductions will last throughout the summer.",
      "\u201cWe have fewer flights, but we keep everything safe, and we get the airplane safely on the ground,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cSafety is number one, and so I\u2019m not worried about safety. I am worried about customer delays and impacts.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway Tuesday in the South of France",
      "Nowhere is the border-crossing nature of cinema more evident than the Cannes Film Festival, which kicks off Tuesday in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to enact tariffs on international films.",
      "Cannes, where filmmakers, sales agents and journalists gather from around the world, is the Olympics of the big screen, with its own golden prize, the Palme d\u2019Or, to give out at the end. Filmmakers come from nearly every corner of the globe to showcase their films while dealmakers work through the night to sell finished films or packaged productions to various territories.",
      "\u201cYou release a film into that Colosseum-like situation,\u201d says Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, who\u2019s returning to Cannes with \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a thriller set during Brazil\u2019s dictatorship. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really prepare for the whole experience because it\u2019s quite intense \u2014 not very far from the feeling of approaching a roller coaster as you go up the steps at the Palais.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway this week. That\u2019s not just because of the long list of anticipated films set to premiere at the Cote d\u2019Azur festival (including films from Spike Lee, Wes Anderson, Lynne Ramsay, Richard Linklater and Ari Aster) and the extensive coterie of stars set to walk the fabled red carpet (Jennifer Lawrence, Denzel Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart among them).",
      "As the movies, and the Oscar race, have grown more international, the global launchpad of Cannes has become only more central to the larger film ecosystem \u2014 even with the ongoing absence of Netflix. Recent editions of Cannes have produced a string of Academy Awards contenders, including this year\u2019s best-picture winner, \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "At the same time, geopolitics course through Cannes unlike any other festival. The Cannes red carpet can be as much a platform for political protest as it is for glamour. This year\u2019s festival will include a dissident Iranian filmmaker (Jafar Panahi), a Ukrainian filmmaker (Sergei Loznitsa) and the first Nigerian production in the official selection (Akinola Davies Jr.'s \u201cMy Father's Shadow\u201d).",
      "In the run-up to the festival, three filmmakers from different corners of the world spoke about their roads to the Cannes competition lineup. For many directors, reaching the Cannes competition \u2014 this year, that's 22 movies vying for the Palme d'Or \u2014 is career milestone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meaningful for me. It\u2019s meaningful for the country,\u201d says Oliver Hermanus, speaking from outside Cape Town. Hermanus, the South African filmmaker of \u201cMoffie\u201d and \u201cLiving,\u201d is in competition for the first time with \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d a period love story starring Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cI was born here and made movies here for most of my career, so I still see myself as a South African filmmaker who\u2019s interested in the South African perspective on things and South African representation,\u201d adds Hermanus. \u201cThe competition is something I\u2019ve always wanted to be part of.\u201d",
      "Chie Hayakawa, the Japanese filmmaker of 2022's \u201cPlan 75,\u201d is also in competition for the first time. She first came to Cannes with a student film that she never expected to make it into the festival\u2019s shorts program. This week, she\u2019ll debut \u201cRenoir,\u201d a semiautobiographical tale about an 11-year-old girl with a father who has terminal cancer.",
      "\u201cIt gives me a huge encouragement and keeps me motivated to making films,\u201d Hayakawa said from Tokyo. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to compete with other films. But it meaningful. I know how prestigious and meaningful it is to be in competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cFilm is global and easily crosses the borders of any country or culture,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what special about Cannes.\u201d",
      "Cannes' global approach is part of what makes this year more complicated than usual. Trump sent shock waves through Hollywood and the international film community when he announced on May 4 that all movies \u201cproduced in Foreign Lands\u201d will face 100% tariffs.",
      "The White House has said no final decisions have been made. Options being explored include federal incentives for U.S.-based productions, rather than tariffs. But the announcement was a reminder of how international tensions can destabilize even the oldest cultural institutions.",
      "Filho first attended Cannes as a critic. Once he began making movies, the allure of the festival remained. To him, participating in Cannes means joining a timeline of cinema history. \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d marks his third time in competition.",
      "\u201cI have always felt that there was a seriousness that I appreciated,\u201d Filho says. \u201cFor example, I will be attending a 2 a.m. test for sound and picture. This is done with scientist types who will take care of the projection and how everything will go.\u201d",
      "As to the threat of tariffs? He shrugs.",
      "\u201cI have been trained by Brazil, because we had a very strange and weird historic moment under (former president Jair) Bolsonaro,\u201d Filho said. \u201cI used my training to say: This is probably some bad idea or misunderstanding that will be corrected in the coming days or weeks. Even for leaders like them, Bolsonaro and Trump, it makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d",
      "The Cannes Film Festival originally emerged in the World War II years, when the rise of fascism in Italy led to the founding of an alternative to the then-government controlled Venice Film Festival. In the time since, Cannes\u2019 resolute commitment to cinema has made it a beacon to filmmakers. Countless directors have come to make their name.",
      "This year is no different, though some of the first-time filmmakers at Cannes are already particularly well-known. Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d), Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d) will all be unveiling their feature directorial debuts in Cannes\u2019 Un Certain Regard sidebar section.",
      "Many Cannes veterans will be back, too, including Tom Cruise (\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning\u201d), Robert De Niro (who\u2019s to receive an honorary Palme d\u2019Or 49 years after \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d premiered in Cannes) and Quentin Tarantino (to pay tribute to low-budget Western director George Sherman).",
      "Hermanus first came to Cannes with his 2011 film \u201cBeauty.\u201d He went naively optimistic before realizing, he laughs, that a Cannes selection is \u201ca potential invitation to a beheading.",
      "\u201cEven going now with \u2018The History of Sound,\u2019 I\u2019m trying to be realistic about the fact that it\u2019s a gladiatorial arena. It\u2019s everything to lose and everything to gain,\u201d says Hermanus. \u201cWhen Cannes selected us, it came down to me and Paul going, \u2018Oh God, here comes the real stress. Will we survive the intensity of Cannes?\u2019 \u2014 which we both agreed is the reason to go.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- At the biggest jewelry center in the United States, Alberto Hernandez fired up his machine on a recent day and waited until it glowed bright orange inside before shoveling in an assortment of rings, earrings and necklaces weighing about as much as a bar of soap: just under 100 grams, or 3.2 troy ounces.",
      "Minutes later, the bubbling liquid metal was cooling in a rectangular cast the size of a woman's shoe. An X-ray machine determined it was 56.5% gold, making it worth $177,000 based on the price of gold that day.",
      "As gold prices soar to record highs during global economic jitters, hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of gold are circulating through the doors of St. Vincent Jewelry Center in downtown Los Angeles on any given day.",
      "Many of the center\u2019s 500 independent tenants, which include jewelers, gold refiners and assayers, say they have never seen such a surge in customers.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rappers and stuff melting their big pieces,\u201d said Alberto\u2019s nephew, Sabashden Hernandez, who works at A&M Precious Metals. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new customers who are just getting all of their grandfather\u2019s stuff, melting it down pretty much.\u201d",
      "Gold\u2019s current rally comes as President Donald Trump issues ever-changing announcements on tariffs, roiling financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation.",
      "In response, people across the country are flocking to sell or melt down their old jewelry for quick cash, including middlemen like pawn shop owners. Others, thinking their money might be safer in gold than in the volatile stock market, are snapping it up just as fast.",
      "Los Angeles jeweler Olivia Kazanjian said people are even bringing in family heirlooms.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re melting things with their family\u2019s wedding dates and things from the 1800s,\u201d Kazanjian said.",
      "She recently paid a client for a 14-karat gold woven bracelet with intricate blue enamel work that could be turned into a brooch. The customer walked away with $3,200 for the amount of gold contained in the piece measured in troy ounces, the standard for precious metals equivalent to 31 grams.",
      "But Kazanjian doesn't plan to melt the piece. The real artistic and historical value was a lot more, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning \u2026 and you won\u2019t see that kind of craftsmanship again,\u201d Kazanjian said, adding she has persuaded some customers to change their minds about melting items. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to inherit it, it\u2019s a piece of your family.\"",
      "Businesses on the sales side of the action, offering gold bars and other material, also are working hard to keep up with the frenzy.",
      "\u201cStuff comes in and it goes right out,\u201d said Edwin Feijoo, who owns Stefko Cash for Gold in Pennsylvania and receives shipments from customers across the U.S. looking to sell their gold. \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy right now.\u201d",
      "Business hasn't been good for everyone, though.",
      "For some jewelers who source their products from places abroad like Italy, Turkey and China, the combination of high gold prices and added tariffs have cut into profit margins and hurt demand.",
      "\u201cOur profit margins are so razor thin here,\u201d said Puzant Berberian, whose family founded V&P Jewelry inside St. Vincent in 1983. Berberian said he recently paid an extra $16,000 on a package from overseas.",
      "Customers also are feeling \u201csticker shock\u201d when they can't afford the things they used to. A chunky, 14-karat gold bracelet weighing about 10 grams (0.32 troy ounces) might have sold for around $600 last year, but now it\u2019s closer to $900, Berberian said.",
      "Some believe those trends could continue, both for consumers and businesses.",
      "Customers hoping to buy bullion \u201cthink gold will go up\u201d even more, according to Sam Nguyen, whose business, Newport Gold Post Inc., has bought and sold gold and other precious metals at St. Vincent for five years. While gold has cooled from its record high of $3,500 per troy ounce, Nguyen thinks it could reach $4,000 to $5,000 by year\u2019s end.",
      "Jeff Clark agrees. The founder of The Gold Advisor, which provides investment advice, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if gold prices continue rising since the metal is considered a haven for people to park their money when there is anxiety about a possible recession.",
      "\u201cHistory shows it has gone much higher in the past,\u201d Clark said, referring to a frenzy in the 1970s when the average price of gold increased 17-fold amid double-digit inflation rates. \u201cIf the fear and uncertainty continues in the general populace, the prices are going to keep going up.\u201d",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Tiger Woods became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam at age 24 when he crossed the Swilcan Bridge at St. Andrews and marched right into history. No one bothered asking who was next because no one was particularly close.",
      "It's different now.",
      "That was some grand occasion for Rory McIlroy when he won the Masters. There was sheer joy from 17 years of trying to win the green jacket, the last 11 years fully aware that he could join the most exclusive group in golf. \u201cWelcome to the club, kid,\u201d is the text Woods sent him.",
      "That raised the question: Who's next?",
      "The attention immediately falls to Jordan Spieth, who has been trying to complete the Grand Slam at the PGA Championship since 2017, the last time it was at Quail Hollow. He has never finished closer than six shots in those previous eight attempts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a number of years I\u2019ve come to the PGA, and no one\u2019s really asked me about it,\u201d Spieth said Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s been some years where it was a storyline, I guess.

      "\u201cCertainly the incentive is there,\" Palmer said when he arrived at Firestone for the 1966 PGA Championship. \u201cI feel so good there can't be any excuses.\u201d",
      "But there was no Grand Slam, not that year or the next 28 years that followed until Palmer played his last PGA Championship in 1994 at age 64. Lee Trevino, Tom Watson and Raymond Floyd all reached the cusp of golf's greatest feat and never crossed the line.",
      "After Nicklaus, it took 34 years before Woods got his Grand Slam, and then 25 years until McIlroy did it.",
      "\u201cDo I think it will take another 25 years? It\u2019s a good question,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said. \u201cJordan can win the Grand Slam by winning four majors. Rory did it in five. ... The odds would say he\u2019s good enough to do it, for sure.\"",
      "Scheffler has been the dominant player for the last three years, winning the Masters in 2022 and 2024 and spending more consecutive weeks at No. 1 than anyone except Woods.",
      "\u201cI've only one won, technically. That's the other side of the coin,\u201d Scheffler said of his chances at the Grand Slam. \u201cI've been playing some pretty good golf and I'm not even close.\u201d",
      "The PGA Championship, which starts Thursday, and the next two majors at Oakmont (U.S. Open) and Royal Portrush (British Open) could go a long way in shaping the conversation for the next several years.",
      "Jon Rahm winning the PGA Championship or British Open. Schauffele or Collin Morikawa winning at the U.S. Open. Dustin Johnson at the PGA Championship or British Open. Brooks Koepka at the British.",
      "That\u2019s all it would take to add to the list of players on the verge of a feat realized by only Woods and McIlroy over the last 59 years.",
      "But as hard as it is to win two majors, getting the third leg is no small task. That much is evident by the number of players who have two legs of the slam and got no closer.",
      "Nick Price won the PGA Championship in 1992 and the British Open in 1994.",
      "\u201cFrom the time I won the first PGA, I wanted to win that Grand Slam so badly,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt's every golfer's dream. I always struggled at Augusta as a low ball-striker. And then the U.S. Open, I had two or three good chances. It was definitely one of those things on my mind.\u201d",
      "Before him was Sandy Lyle and Nick Faldo, Fuzzy Zoeller and Larry Nelson, Hubert Green and the late Seve Ballesteros. The Spaniard had two legs of the Grand Slam at age 23.",
      "Faldo won six majors \u2014 three apiece at the British Open and Masters \u2014 giving him the most majors of any players in the last century who got only two legs of the Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get on the cusp, but it\u2019s a lot easier to get on the cusp than to actually pull it off,\u201d Scheffler said. He paused before adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to get on the cusp.\u201d",
      "And it doesn't get any easier as time goes on. The modern version of the Grand Slam didn't start until Palmer mentioned it in 1960. Gene Sarazen (1935) and Ben Hogan (1953) won the career slam retrospectively. It still counts.",
      "Player (29), Nicklaus (26) and Woods were all in their 20s when they captured the last leg. McIlroy was 35 when he finally got the Masters, perhaps another reason he was so emotional that day at Augusta National, and still looks to be floating on air.",
      "Johnson turned 40 last year and his game in the majors has dropped substantially since joining LIV Golf. Koepka turned 35 last month and has gone seven straight majors without a top 10 since winning the 2023 PGA Championship, the longest such streak of his career.",
      "Spieth is 31, winless in three years but still in his prime. If he isn't next, perhaps the focus shifts to who joins the line.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Jannik Sinner is still regaining his focus on the tennis court after his three-month doping ban.",
      "The top-ranked player overcame a brief lapse during the first set of a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Dutch qualifier Jesper De Jong in his second match back on tour at the Italian Open on Monday.",
      "Sinner jumped out to a 4-1 lead but then lost his serve twice as the 93rd-ranked De Jong evened the first set at 4-4.",
      "There were poor drop shots, an inopportune double-fault and other errors from Sinner. But the Italian regained control in front of his home crowd with his powerful groundstrokes and big serve and extended his winning streak to 23 matches, dating back to October.",
      "\u201cI felt like I started the match very well and then I had a big drop,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cI tried to understand what was going on. Then fortunately I broke him on 4-all again, which then gave me the confidence to continue.\u201d",
      "Sinner is into the last 16 of his first tournament since he won his third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.",
      "In February, Sinner agreed to the three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency that raised some questions, since it conveniently allowed him not to miss any Grand Slams and come back at his home tournament.",
      "The Italian Open is the last big warmup before the French Open starts on May 25.",
      "Just like in his opening win over Mariano Navone on Saturday, the fans at the Foro Italico were fully behind Sinner \u2014 Italy\u2019s first No. 1.",
      "Yelling \u201cVai Jannik\u201d (\u201cGo Jannik\u201d) and singing his name, the crowd provided encouragement whenever Sinner needed it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to have him back,\u201d 12th-ranked Tommy Paul said of Sinner after beating Tomas Machac 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4. \u201cHe\u2019s such a big figure in the sport. He kind of sets the bar right now.\u201d",
      "The last Italian man to win the Rome title was Adriano Panatta in 1976.",
      "Sinner led De Jong 22-16 in winners and had fewer unforced errors than his opponent, 16-25 \u2014 after trailing in that category against Navone.",
      "Sinner also served better, producing four aces.",
      "Sinner will next face 17th-seeded Francisco Cerundolo, who beat Austrian qualifier Sebastian Ofner 6-2, 6-4.",
      "Cerundolo is coming off a run to the Madrid Open semifinals and beat Nicolas Jarry \u2014 last year\u2019s Rome finalist \u2014 in straight sets in the opening round.",
      "\u201cLast time I played here, I lost against him here on this court,\u201d Sinner said, referring to a three-set loss to Cerundolo in the round of 16 two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. For sure I have to raise my level if I want to play even. \u2026 I\u2019m trying to understand where my game is so it\u2019s going to be a good challenge, good test for me.\u201d",
      "De Jong fell to the clay when he lost his footing trying to reach a passing shot from Sinner in the second set and the Italian came across the net to check on him. Sinner fetched a towel for De Jong and wiped off the Dutchman\u2019s racket handle.",
      "De Jong then needed medical attention for his right wrist before resuming play.",
      "Also reaching the fourth round was seventh-seeded Alex De Minaur, who beat Bolivian qualifier Hugo Dellien in a match that was interrupted twice during the first set \u2014 first when a spectator got sick and then because of a flyover by the Italian Air Force\u2019s acrobatic team.",
      "De Minaur was visibly frustrated by the flyover.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t handle it very well, because I got broken straight away,\u201d De Minaur said. \u201cI did well to bounce back and get the break back, but I\u2019ve got to be a little bit better mentally to not let those things, outside factors affect me.\u201d",
      "In the women\u2019s round of 16, Coco Gauff routed Emma Raducanu 6-1, 6-2 in a matchup of former U.S. Open champions.",
      "Peyton Stearns eliminated Naomi Osaka 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (4) after 2 hours, 41 minutes. Stearns also edged Australian Open champion Madison Keys in a third-set tiebreaker in her previous match.",

      "NEW DELHI, India -- India great Virat Kohli retired from test cricket Monday after playing 123 matches in his glorious 14-year red-ball career.",
      "Kohli made his test debut in 2011 against West Indies and has been India's standout batter since Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s retirement in 2013.",
      "\u201cAs I step away from this format, it\u2019s not easy \u2014 but it feels right,\u201d Kohli posted on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It\u2019s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I\u2019ll carry for life.\u201d",
      "The 36-year-old Kohli\u2019s retirement comes only days after Rohit Sharma stepped down from test cricket, taking two senior batters out of selection contention for India's tour to England. India will need to select a new skipper and reshape its batting order for the five-test series starting June 20.",
      "Kohli scored 9,230 runs including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries at a test batting average of 46.85. He also led India in 68 test matches and was India\u2019s most successful captain with 40 test wins.",
      "The former India captain is one of the highest-profile people in cricket, with 271 million followers on Instagram and almost 68 million on X, and he owns batting records in the longest and the limited-overs formats. He's expected to continue playing one-day international cricket, and he's still heavily involved in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League, which was suspended last Friday for a week following the escalating military tensions with Pakistan.",
      "Kohli said the traditions and ebbs and flows of the five-day format were special to him, including \u201cthe quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am walking away with a heart full of gratitude \u2014 for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,\u201d he wrote. \"I will always look back at my test career with a smile. #269, signing off.\u201d",
      "Kohli finished as India\u2019s fourth highest scorer in tests after Tendulkar (15,921), Rahul Dravid (13,265) and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122). He also scored the most double centuries for India in tests \u2014 seven \u2014 one more than the legendary Tendulkar.",
      "His crowning glory in test cricket, though, came as captain. His 40 test wins set a record for an India captain, surpassing MS Dhoni (27 from 60 tests) and Sourav Ganguly (21 from 49 tests).",
      "He finished fourth in the all-time list of most wins as test captain, behind South Africa\u2019s Graeme Smith (53 from 109 tests), and Australia\u2019s Ricky Ponting (48 from 77 tests) and Stephen Waugh (41 from 57 tests).",
      "Kohli also led India to the International Cricket Council's No. 1 ranking in test cricket after taking over from Dhoni in 2014-15, and helped his side maintain a stronghold on that position for five years.",
      "In 2018, he guided India to its first ever test series victory against Australia in Australia.",
      "Speculation over Kohli\u2019s test future has intensified since India's five-test tour of Australia finished in January. After scoring a 30th test hundred in Perth, Kohli\u2019s series tapered off and he finished it with 190 runs in nine innings at average 23.75. Still, his impact on the game in India and around the cricket world has been huge.",
      "\u201cThank you, Virat Kohli. An era ends in test cricket but the legacy will continue forever,\" the Board of Control for Cricket in India posted in a statement on X. \"His contributions to team India will forever be cherished!\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "\u201cIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law.\" Paxton said in a statement. \u201cFor years, Google secretly tracked people\u2019s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.\u201d",

      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",
      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to best handle the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom. Even before Pelkey\u2019s family used AI to give him a voice for the victim impact portion \u2014 believed to be a first in U.S. courts \u2014 the Arizona Supreme Court created a committee that researches best AI practices.",
      "In Florida, a judge recently donned a virtual reality headset meant to show the point of view of a defendant who said he was acting in self-defense when he waved a loaded gun at wedding guests. The judge rejected his claim.",

      "Experts say using AI in courtrooms raises legal and ethical concerns, especially if it's used effectively to sway a judge or jury. And they argue it could have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities facing prosecution.",
      "\u201cI imagine that will be a contested form of evidence, in part because it could be something that advantages parties that have more resources over parties that don\u2019t,\" said David Evan Harris, an expert on AI deep fakes at UC Berkeley\u2019s business school.",
      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",
      "In the Arizona case, the victim's sister told The Associated Press that she did consider the \u201cethics and morals\u201d of writing a script and using her brother's likeness to give him a voice during the sentencing hearing.",

      "Chimpanzees drum with regular rhythm when they beat on tree trunks, a new study shows.",
      "Chimpanzees and humans last shared a common ancestor around 6 million years ago. Scientists suspect this ancient ancestor must have been a drummer \u2014 using beats to communicate.",
      "\u201cOur ability to produce rhythm \u2014 and to use it in our social worlds \u2014 that seems to be something that predates humans being human,\u201d said study co-author Cat Hobaiter, a University of St Andrews primatologist.",
      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "It's well-known that chimps use tools such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to \u201cfish\u201d termites from their mounds. Tree roots can also be tools, the researchers say.",
      "Chimps are selective about which roots they pound, said co-author Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France. Certain shapes and wood varieties create sounds that travel well through dense jungle.",
      "The drummings are likely \"a very important way to make contact,\" she said.",

      "Built to land on the solar system's hottest planet, the titanium-covered spacecraft may survive its fiery, uncontrolled plunge through Earth's atmosphere, predicted to occur on Saturday. But experts said it likely would come down over water, covering most of the world, or a desolate region.",

      "\u201cWhile we can anticipate that most of this object will not burn up in the atmosphere during reentry, it may be severely damaged on impact,\" Pilinski said in an email.",
      "By Friday, all indications pointed to a reentry early Saturday morning, U.S. Eastern Time, give or take several hours. While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down. That uncertainty was due to potential solar activity and the spacecraft\u2019s old condition. Its parachutes were expected to be useless by now and its batteries long dead.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek estimated the impact speed at 150 mph (242 kph) if the spacecraft remains intact.",
      "The Soviets launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, intending to send it to Venus to join other spacecraft in their Venera program. But a rocket malfunction left this one stuck in orbit around Earth. Gravity kept tugging on it and was expected to finally cause its doom.",
      "Spherical in shape, the spacecraft \u2014 3-foot (1-meter) across and packing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms) \u2014 will be the last piece of Kosmos 482 to fall from the sky. All the other parts plummeted within a decade.",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",

      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

      "\u201cI remain open-minded because progress has been made based on our forceful efforts to force change. But we cannot continue down the path we\u2019ve been going down - and we will need SIGNIFICANT additional changes to garner my support,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "Asked on Tuesday if he was worried about members like Roy getting behind the bill,\" Johnson responded, \"No one is going to get 100 percent of what we want. Chip is one of my best friends. We communicated within the last hour, and we'll talk again today. I think we get everybody to yes.\"",
      "Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail and in the White House to not cut Medicaid and he and Republicans said they'll come up with savings by cutting waste and fraud in the program.",
      "Before heading off on a four-day trip to the Middle East on Monday, he urged Republicans to \"UNIFY\" around the bill and said the executive order he signed Monday that would \"slash the cost of prescription drugs\" and the \"hundreds of billions of tariff money coming in\" should be factored into the bill's scoring.",
      "With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, they are using a process called reconciliation that only requires a simple majority for passage to fast-track their legislation.",
      "Republicans unveiled legislative text over the weekend that outlined their plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements for recipients, make more frequent eligibility checks, and penalize states like New York and California that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie that the proposal met its lofty target for $880 billion of savings over the next decade.",
      "The Energy and Commerce committee resisted pressure from hardliners like Roy who demanded GOP leaders propose lowering the percentage the federal government pays to states\u2019 Medicaid programs or include per-capita caps on federal Medicaid payments to states.",
      "The health portions would save about $715 billion, according to CBO. However, at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured.",
      "Some culture war issues were addressed in the bill, including a provision to strip Medicaid funding from organizations that offer abortion services such as Planned Parenthood.",
      "The legislation has already received pushback from Republicans in the Senate who will have to go along with it, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times Monday warning against moves to cut Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThis wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor. But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal,\u201d Sen. Hawley wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the Ways and Means Committee, which is marking up the tax portion of the bill, outlined a permanent extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, as well as making good on his campaign promises like no tax on tips and no tax on overtime.",
      "The plan would temporarily increase the child tax credit, create a MAGA savings account for children and temporarily increase the standard tax deduction. It also calls for a $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, which Congress must address by mid-July to avoid default.",
      "Some moderate Republicans have been adamant about not cutting into Medicaid, a benefit many of their constituents rely on.",
      "The legislation also includes one of the most controversial components -- a tax proposal that would hike the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT) from $10,000 to $30,000 for those earning less than $400,000, which some moderate Republicans from states with higher taxes say is not enough.",
      "New York Rep. Nick LaLota said he is \u201cstill a hell no\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told Bloomberg TV the proposal was \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d adding that he will vote against the bill if it comes to the floor.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to work in good faith with leadership, with the administration to get this done, but we need to have an honest and serious discussion about the issue,\u201d he added.",
      "Here's what's in the bill:",
      "Medicaid cuts",
      "Medicaid work requirements: The bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.",
      "More frequent eligibility checks: The legislation would require states to conduct more frequent eligibility determinations -- from every 12 months to every six months.",
      "Prohibits Medicaid funds for gender transition for minors: The measure would ban federal Medicaid funds from going to gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "Blocks Medicaid funding for non-citizens: Federal funding would be blocked from going to states that provide health care coverage under Medicare for migrants in the country without authorization.",
      "Targets Medicaid funding for organizations that provide abortions: The measure includes language that would essentially prohibit health care providers who offer abortion services from receiving Medicaid funds.",
      "Drug pricing: The bill makes a change to the Inflation Reduction Act and allows drugs to be exempt from Medicare\u2019s drug price negotiation if they are approved to treat multiple diseases.",
      "Cuts energy programs in Inflation Reduction Act: The proposal would cut Inflation Reduction Act programs like spending on electric vehicles, claw back climate-related federal funding and phase out clean energy credits.",
      "Tax provisions",
      "No tax on tips: A huge tax break for the service industry and a provision that was also trumpeted by Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president, though she tied the tax break to an increase for the federal minimum wage. This is temporary and would expire at the end of 2028.",
      "No tax on overtime: Would relieve millions of Americans who work overtime. This is temporary and would also expire at the end of 2028.",
      "Extension of 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act: Makes tax from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent; does not include a tax increase on the wealthiest earners. Trump posted last week that the proposal shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on high-earners, \u201cbut I'm OK if they do!!!\"",
      "Creation of MAGA savings account for children: The contribution limit for any taxable year is $5,000. It includes a pilot program to start the accounts with $1,000.",
      "SALT: Lifts state and local tax deduction cap to $30,000 with an income phase-down above $400,000. Married couples filing taxes separately are subject to a $15,000 cap and phase-down above $200,000 income.",
      "Debt limit increase: The measure calls for increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week lawmakers must address the debt limit by mid-July to avoid a default.",
      "Enhanced tax deduction for seniors: Seniors would get a $4,000 higher standard tax deduction subject to income limits. This is temporary and would also expire at the end of 2028.",
      "Hikes excise tax on colleges: Those with endowments over $2 million per student would increase from 1.4% to 21%, targeting Ivy League schools. Religious schools would be exempt.",
      "Child tax credit: A temporary increase from $1,000 to $2,500 through 2028 and to $2,000 after that. Recipients will be required to have a Social Security number.",
      "Deduction for qualified business: The bill would increase the deduction for qualified business income from 20% to 22%.",
      "Extends increased estate and gift tax exemption: Would increase the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million.",
      "Elevates standard tax deduction: The measure includes some new tax cuts like temporarily elevating the standard deduction by $2,000 to $32,000 for 2025 for joint filers and by $1,000 to $16,000 through 2028.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 06:54:41 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has tapped a roster of ambassadors with more personal and financial ties than any recent president, former diplomats and policy experts told ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Among his nominees are family members and high-profile media backers.",
      "As the Trump administration pushes its \"America First\" agenda, cutting foreign aid agencies and challenging longtime allies, President Donald Trump has tapped a roster of ambassadors with more personal and financial ties than any recent president, former diplomats and foreign policy experts told ABC News.",
      "Trump has, in just over 100 days in office, selected family members, wealthy members of his clubs, and high-profile media backers to carry out his \"America First\" mission at key outposts across the globe. Nearly all have lengthy records of publicly and vocally supporting the president, while only a handful have diplomatic backgrounds or experience in foreign services.",
      "Trump's diplomatic nominees have also collectively poured tens of millions of dollars into his political operations, with the so-called \"donor to ambassadorship pipeline\" -- where major political fundraisers secure plush ambassadorial appointments -- becoming more pronounced under the second Trump presidency.",
      "\"It's the sale of diplomatic posts in return for campaign money, and both sides have been playing that,\" said Anthony Gardner, a former ambassador to the European Union under the Biden administration. \"Indeed, it's been happening across the aisle for a long time, for decades even, and it's gotten much more pronounced in this term, the second Trump term, than ever before.\"",
      "At least 38 of the 50 individuals announced or confirmed to diplomatic positions so far have either donated to or helped fundraise for Trump-connected political entities, directing at least $46 million to his presidential campaigns, various pro-Trump super PACs, or to Trump's record-breaking second inaugural committee, disclosure records show. Those figures do not account for additional contributions bundled by those individuals.",
      "By comparison, according to government ethics advocacy group Campaign Legal Center's analysis from 2023, former President Joe Biden's ambassador appointees together gave a total of $22 million to various Democratic candidates and groups, including to the Biden campaign, in the ten years prior to their nomination.",
      "Trump has also tapped several members of his extended family for diplomatic roles, nominating Charles Kushner, his eldest daughter's father-in-law, as ambassador to France, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, his eldest son's ex-fianc\u00e9e, as ambassador to Greece.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Ed McMullen, a prolific Republican bundler and Trump's former ambassador to Switzerland, says that a close personal relationship with the president can be a key strength as an ambassador, noting Guilfoyle as an example.",
      "\"Since the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin serving as our first ambassadors were close to the president,\" McMullen said. \"There are supporters, they're donors, they're hard-working advocates, they're friends. This is the case with every ambassador.\"",
      "\"When you're in Europe or anywhere in the world, and you're an ambassador representing the president of the United States and you can pick up the phone and call him and have a one-on-one relationship with the president, the president and the government of the country you're hosted in will be extremely appreciative of that timely efficacy that occurs from that,\" McMullen said, recounting his experience as an ambassador under the first Trump presidency.",
      "\"That's the whole purpose of having political appointees and not career people in critical countries with allies and friends,\" he said.",
      "But Campaign Legal Center\u2019s Senior of Direct of Ethics Kedric Payne told ABC News that if nominees have no prior diplomatic experience beyond their personal relationship with the president, it can leave the impression that \"qualifications don't matter as much as who you know.\"",
      "\"When you have something as critical as foreign policy based on who you know, it does diminish trust in government that these decisions are not based on the greater public interest,\" Payne said.",
      "Trump's diplomatic nominees, like his cabinet picks, also include a high number of high-worth individuals. For the G7 alliance of the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the U.K., Trump has assembled one of the wealthiest group of ambassadors to hold those spots, with three billionaires out of the five nominees that have been named so far.",
      "The three billionaires -- Kushner, GOP megadonor and financier Warren Stephens, and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta -- together disclosed assets that could be worth a combined value of more than $8 billion. Kushner -- who disclosed the extent of his private wealth for the first time -- reported owning assets potentially worth more than $3.6 billion, boasting a vast real estate portfolio across the United States, and reporting earnings as high as half a billion dollars in income last year.",
      "The two other G7 ambassadors -- George Glass and Pete Hoekstra -- are returning diplomats from Trump's first term.",
      "Others who Trump has tapped as ambassadors this time around include Herschel Walker, the former NFL star who unsuccessfully ran for Georgia Senate in 2022; Bill White, Trump's longtime friend and Palm Beach neighbor who rallied conservative LGBTQ votes in support of Trump during the last presidential election; and Leandro Rizzuto, a Conair heir who was picked as an ambassador during Trump's first term but failed to get confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Among the campaign surrogates and allies who have received ambassadorships are Mayor Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, Michigan, who helped bring together Muslim voters in Michigan for Trump; CatholicVote.org co-founder Brian Burch, a vocal critic of late Pope Francis; and ex-border patrol union leader Bradon Judd, who often spoke about immigration and border security at Trump rallies.",
      "Several of those nominees have already faced a tough confirmation process as critics have questioned their qualifications.",
      "Last week, Kushner, who pleaded guilty to 18 charges related to illegal campaign contributions and tax evasion in 2004 and was pardoned by Trump a month before he left the White House in his first term, was pressed by Senate Democrats about his past legal woes during his confirmation hearing.",
      "During the hearing, Kushner acknowledged that his past run-in with the law was \"a very, very, very serious mistake\" but maintained his experience has helped him make better judgments and has made him \"more qualified\" for the ambassador role.",
      "Other ambassador nominees who have faced legal troubles include White, the ambassador nominee to Belgium and former head of New York's Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, who paid a $1 million settlement for his alleged role in an alleged illegal pay-to-play state pension fund scheme in New York, for which he denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's former inaugural committee chair Tom Barrack, who was charged for alleged illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates in 2021, was acquitted when a jury found him not guilty on all his charges. Barrack has been nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to Turkey, a key diplomatic position that until recently was held mostly by career diplomats, and he touted his experience dealing with \"business, governmental, legal and cultural issues in Europe, the Middle East and Asia\" in his Certificate of Competency submitted through the State Department.",
      "Walker, who lost his Senate race to incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the runoff election, faced allegations of violent behavior and forcing multiple women to have abortions -- allegations he denied.",
      "For Rizzuto, his nomination to become the ambassador to the Organization of American States is the second time he's vying for an ambassadorship, after facing bipartisan opposition during Trump's first term for his ambassador nomination to Barbados, largely due to his now-deleted social media posts about Trump's political rivals during the 2016 election in which he called Mitt Romney a \"Dumb A--\" and Hillary Clinton a \"terrorist with amnesia,\" while accusing Sen. Ted Cruz's wife Heidi of being a leader in the North American Union movement, \"whose goal is to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.\"",
      "Trump, during his first term, eventually appointed Rizzuto to head the U.S. consulate in Bermuda, which does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "Amid diplomatic challenges that include the conflict in the Middle East and high stakes tariff negotiations, only a handful of ambassadors have been confirmed and sworn in so far -- including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as the ambassador to Israel, former Georgia Sen. Davie Perdue as the ambassador to China, and Trump's campaign surrogate and former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker as ambassador to NATO.",
      "Huckabee, who is the father of Trump's former press secretary and now Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has had a lucrative year in 2024, earning more than $6 million from his various private ventures, including millions from his television and radio host work and nearly half a million each from Substack subscriptions and dozens of speaking engagements, according to financial disclosures.",
      "Numerous other ambassador nominees, including Walker and Guilfoyle, have yet to publicly release their financial disclosures through the Office of Government Ethics, nor have they released their Certificates of Competency through the State Department -- both of which must be filed before Senate confirmation.",
      "Payne, of the Campaign Legal Center, said that without those disclosures, it's difficult to know a nominee's financial interests and qualifications.",
      "\"It is not a problem that a person simply contributes to the president and becomes an ambassador,\" Payne told ABC News. \"The problem is when that person is not qualified for the position.\"",
      "Payne stressed that it's too early to make overarching observations about the qualifications of Trump's ambassador picks -- but he said that, no matter who the president is, diplomats must be qualified for their role.",
      "\"What's happening in the Trump administration now, where foreign policy is so critical and so delicate based on issues that are happening with tariffs and other administrative policies, it's the worst time to have unqualified representatives of United States in these countries,\" Payne said.",

    "story": [
      "The solicitor general called the migrants \"especially dangerous to maintain.\"",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has requested the Supreme Court's permission to deport nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, asking the court to lift the injunction it issued last month that temporarily blocked the deportation of the migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In a filing on Monday, the Trump administration said that the 176 alleged members of Tren de Aragua \"have proven to be especially dangerous to maintain in prolonged detention.\"",
      "According to a sworn declaration, an official for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that a group of 23 migrants \"threatened to take hostages and injure facility contract staff and ICE officers.\"",
      "\"The detainees failed to comply with orders to dismantle the barricades and were barricaded in the housing unit for several hours,\" said Joshua Johnson, the ICE official.",
      "In the declaration, Johnson said the group of migrants were moved from Bluebonnet Detention Facility to Prairieland Detention Center last week.",
      "\"Relocating the detainees to Prairieland was necessary because the organized and coordinated nature of the detainee misconduct threatened the security, safety, and order of the Bluebonnet facility and posed a risk to other detainees, staff, contractors, and any visitors within the facility,\" Johnson said.",
      "In the filing on Monday, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that SCOTUS should not block the removal of detainees \"who have been endangering others while in detention.\"",
      "\"One of the key reasons the government has decided to use the more expeditious procedures of the AEA to remove the putative class members in the first place is because of the dangers posed by TdA members while in detention,\" Sauer said in the filing.",
      "The solicitor general also said that the migrants have received \"adequate notice\" and the opportunity to pursue habeas petitions.",
      "\"The three weeks afforded here are more than adequate to pursue habeas,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet as far as the government is aware, no members of the putative class who have received notice of removal pursuant to the AEA have filed habeas petitions in the Northern District of Texas while the administrative injunction has remained in place.\"",
      "Sauer said the court should modify its recent temporary block to \"clarify\" that the order only bars removal of the class members under the AEA.",
      "\"The vast majority of putative class members,\" according to Sauer, are eligible for \"prompt\" removal under Title 8 authorities.",
      "\"The difficulty of detaining the putative class members discussed above has now made it imperative for the government to pursue removal under authorities other than the AEA while the Court's administrative injunction remains in place,\" Sauer's court filing said.",

    "story": [
      "At least six separate lawsuits have targeted President Trump's use of tariffs",
      "In an obscure courthouse in downtown Manhattan on Tuesday, a group of small businesses will take on one of President Donald Trump's boldest uses of executive authority.",
      "A panel of judges on the Court of International Trade will hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging Trump's sweeping tariffs, as the president's trade war continues to disrupt the international economy and raise the specter of a recession.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last month by a group of small businesses, including a New York liquor distributor, Utah pipe company, Virginia electronics store, Pennsylvania-based tackle shop, and Vermont cycling company. Each company argued they rely on imports from countries like China and Mexico and would be irreparably harmed by what they called Trump's \"unprecedented power grab illegal.\"",
      "The small business argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the power to unilaterally impose tariffs like Trump did last month with a blanket tariff rate and higher rates for certain countries. They described the national emergency Trump used to justify the tariffs as a \"figment of his own imagination\" because the United States has operated with massive trade deficits for years without causing economic harm.",
      "\"If actually granted by statute, this power would be an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the executive without any intelligible principle to limit his discretion,\" they argued.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice have pushed back on the lawsuit, saying that Congress permits the president to impose some tariffs, and Trump's invoking of a national emergency makes his power \"broader,\" justifying the sweeping tariffs. They have also argued that a court order blocking the tariffs would unlawfully encroach on the president's authority.",
      "\"Plaintiffs' proposed injunction would be an enormous intrusion on the President's conduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security under IEEPA and the Constitution,\" they argued.",
      "At least six separate lawsuits have targeted Trump's use of tariffs, including a case filed by the state of California and a coalition of twelve state attorneys general. While some of the cases were filed in district courts, the cases have gradually been transferred to the Court of International Trade, making Tuesday's argument the first time a panel of judges hears a challenge to Trump's tariffs.",
      "Last month, the court rejected an emergency request for a temporary order to block the tariffs, finding that the businesses failed to prove that an \"immediate and irreparable harm\" would stem from the tariffs.",
      "Tuesday's argument will be heard by a panel of three judges \u2013 Gary S. Katzmann, Timothy M. Reif, and Jane A. Restani \u2013 who were appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump and Reagan respectively.",
      "Tucked away in a corner of New York's Foley Square, the Court of International Trade has nationwide jurisdiction on trade disputes and has recently focused its energy on more niche issues, like honey customs disputes and mattress imports. Tuesday's oral argument is set to provide the most high-profile hearing for the court in recent memory.",

    "story": [
      "The 220 top crypto coin holders have won tickets to a dinner gala with Trump.",
      "The race to win tickets to an exclusive crypto dinner gala with President Donald Trump at his private golf club in Virginia on May 22 ended with top 220 holders of the Trump meme coin winning invitations to the black tie gala, the coin's official X account announced Monday.",
      "A \"leaderboard\" of the top 220 holders appearing on the website did not display the identities of the winners, but it listed numerous wallets that some crypto experts have linked to possible foreign individuals and entities, heightening concerns about potential conflicts of interest arising from the Trump family's businesses and foreign interests.",
      "According to the meme coin's website, the top 25 \"VIP holders\" were also invited to what it described as an \"Exclusive Reception before Dinner\" and a \"Special VIP Tour.\"",
      "As the Trump family stands to potentially take in tens of millions of dollars from the coin's transactions and possibly even more from its ownership of the coin, the price of Trump's meme coin has been in constant fluctuation over the past three weeks, with numerous supporters and crypto enthusiasts flocking to purchase the coin to secure a seat at the gala while numerous others sell the coin to profit off the hype.",
      "The coin's price dropped rapidly on Monday as the competition ended, and was priced at $12.59 as of 4 p.m. ET. When the gala competition was first announced last year, the coin's price jumped by more than 55% and later reached a high of nearly $16.42, according to Coinbase.com.",
      "While fluctuations in the Trump coin's price have resulted in massive profits for a fortunate few, hundreds of thousands of investors have reportedly lost money on the coin. According to CNBC's reporting of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis' data, roughly 764,000 crypto wallets have lost money on Trump meme coin investments, while 58 wallets have made millions from their Trump coin investments.",
      "A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Asked about the Trump meme coin and concerns over potential conflicts of interest at a press briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president is \"abiding by all conflict of interest laws.\"",
      "\"The president has been incredibly transparent with his own personal financial obligation throughout the years,\" Leavitt said. \"I can assure you the president acts with only the interests of the American public in mind, putting our country first and doing what's best for our country. Full stop. That's his intention, and that's what he's focused on.\"",
      "Although the coin's website had earlier advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 coin holders, as of Monday afternoon it simply said \"Special VIP tour,\" without mentioning the White House. Additionally, the website included a disclaimer saying the tour is being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself is appearing as a \"guest.\"",
      "In its social media announcement about the conclusion of the contest, the post also announced a \"rewards points program\" and the awarding of \"exclusive NFTs\" for the winners.",
      "According to crypto experts, the wallet of the top coin holder -- nicknamed \"Sun\" and currently holding roughly $16.6 million worth of the Trump meme coin -- is owned by a foreign crypto exchange advised by Chinese billionaire Justin Sun, who recently moderated a panel discussion between Eric Trump and Zack Witkoff at a crypto conference in Dubai, where Witkoff announced the other Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, had partnered in a $2 billion business deal with an Abu Dahbi state-backed investment firm. Justin Sun did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Sun is also one of World Liberty Financials' biggest investors, purchasing $75 million worth of its coin the day before Trump's inauguration earlier this year. A month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun, who along with his companies has denied wrongdoing.",
      "The second top holder, a Singaporean entity identified by crypto experts as likely being MemeCore, and nicknamed \"MeCo,\" has been more vocal about their race to secure a VIP ticket -- publicly soliciting followers to send Trump coin to their wallet so they can achieve \"#1 on the $TRUMP leaderboard\" and \"conquer the entire meme space,\" with the promise of returning the tokens after the event.",
      "In all, the top 220 folders hold a total of 13.7 million Trump coins, valued at nearly $14 million as of 4 p.m. ET Monday, according to Coinbase.com.",
      "Notably, 17 out of the top 220 coin holders on the leaderboard, including one in the top 25, appeared to hold zero Trump coin as of Monday afternoon -- possibly meaning that they sold their holdings before the contest ended.",
      "Experts say this is possible because the top 220 holders were chosen based on \"time weighted holdings,\" which were calculated based on \"both the amount and duration\" of one's holdings from April 23 through May 12. \"The longer you hold, the higher your weighted score becomes,\" the website says.",
      "It's not clear if the zero Trump coin holders will get invited to the event.",

      "During remarks at the White House on Monday, before embarking on a four-day trip to the Middle East, Trump called the donation a \"very nice gesture\" when pressed by reporters if Qatar had asked for anything in exchange.",
      "\"I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. Appreciate it very much,\" Trump said. \"I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.' But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.\"",
      "\"I think it was a gesture because of the fact that we help, have helped, and continue to, we will continue to all of those countries, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and others,\" he continued.",
      "Trump said he doesn't plan to use the plane after he leaves office.",
      "Further pressed by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott on what he would say to people who view the luxury plane as a personal gift to him, Trump said it was not a gift to him but \"a gift to the Department of Defense.\"",

      "A trade agreement between the U.S. and China on Monday slashed tit-for-tat tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies and triggered a surge in the stock market.",
      "The U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China committed to reduce tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. The lowered tariffs will remain in place for 90 days while the two sides negotiate a wider trade deal.",
      "Still, the agreement appeared to leave key sticking points unresolved as the two countries work through a newly established mechanism for further discussions.",
      "In a joint statement, the U.S. and China touted the agreement as evidence that both sides recognize the \u201cimportance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new trade framework:",
      "The trade agreement temporarily reduces tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement last month.",
      "The previous set of sky-high tariffs had threatened a surge in prices and a possible U.S. recession, experts told ABC News.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in 90 days,\u201d Wei said.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump acknowledged that verbal commitments made by both sides must be \u201cpapered,\u201d meaning the broad accord has yet to be formalized through detailed agreements.",
      "Trump has previously said he would like to narrow a $300 billion U.S. trade deficit with China, and roll back what he describes as non-tariff barriers to U.S. trade. The framework announced on Monday did not detail steps toward those efforts, Wei said.",
      "The agreement also appeared to lack final resolution for a key sticking point centered on U.S. access to important materials largely controlled by China.",
      "China imposed export restrictions on some rare earth elements and magnets that make up critical inputs in some U.S. auto, energy and defense products.",
      "For now, Chinese companies can still export to U.S. customers, though the Chinese firms must receive approval from the Chinese government.",
      "After the agreement, U.S. buyers are expected to have an easier path for such approval, but the restrictions are not expected to be fully removed, Reuters reported.",
      "Rare earths are vital for a range of defense technologies, including F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles and radar systems, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, said last month.",
      "The U.S. will likely also seek guarantees from China about the purchase of U.S. products, including agricultural goods, Wei said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wei added, China will want to safeguard its access to U.S. markets, ensuring such exports continue to help drive the Chinese economy.",
      "\u201cChina probably wants to adjust to reduce its dependence on U.S. markets,\u201d Wei said. \u201cBut it wants to make sure those markets don\u2019t go right away.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans want to set aside up to $5 billion a year for scholarships to help families send their children to private and religious schools, an unprecedented effort to use public money to pay for private education.",
      "The proposal, part of a budget reconciliation bill released Monday, would advance President Donald Trump's agenda of establishing \u201cuniversal school choice\u201d by providing families nationwide the option to give their children an education different from the one offered in their local public school. Nearly all households would qualify except those making more than three times the local median income.",
      "Supporters of private school vouchers say they want to give families assigned to low-performing schools more choices.",
      "\u201cGiving parents the ability to choose the best education for their child makes the (American Dream) possible,\u201d said Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who sponsored a similar proposal in the Senate.",
      "The program would be funded by donors who could contribute money or stock. In turn, they would receive 100% of the contribution back in the form of a discount on their tax bills. It would allow stock holders to avoid paying taxes that would be levied if they donated or transferred the stock.",
      "Critics decried the proposal, saying it would aid the wealthy at the expense of the public school systems that serve the overwhelming majority of students. They said it would set up a tax shelter allowing savvy investors to make money under the guise of a donation.",
      "All of this comes as the Trump administration downsizes the Education Department and cuts resources to public schools, including $1 billion in mental health grants and funding for teacher training.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant threat,\u201d said Sasha Pudelski of AASA, the School Superintendents Association. She added that states that have voucher programs often end up assisting families that were already paying for private school. \u201cIt\u2019s opening the door even wider to what has already plagued voucher programs around the country, which is rampant waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d",
      "Similar tax-credit scholarship and private school voucher programs have proliferated in red-leaning states like Texas, which just passed a $1 billion program. Public school advocates worry the programs hurt enrollment and per-pupil funding, ultimately leaving fewer resources for families that choose public schools.",

Mikie Sherrill, one of the Democrats running for governor in next month\u2019s primary.",
      "Liberal strategists, organizers and some politicians are urging Democrats to focus on the economy in this year's elections rather than on immigration. Some argue a broad economic message would be more effective with the wide range of nationalities and experiences in the Latino community rather than customized efforts based on perceived cultural or political interests.",
      "Last year, Trump, a Republican, made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania and turned South Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley while improving his numbers along Florida\u2019s Interstate 4 corridor.

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs was sworn in to a new term on Tuesday after the Democrat won a monthslong fight against her Republican rival\u2019s challenges to thousands of ballots.",
      "The State Board of Elections on Tuesday issued an election certificate to Riggs based on a 734-vote victory over GOP rival Jefferson Griffin from over 5.5 million ballots cast. The board was complying with a federal judge's order last week against Griffin, who conceded rather than appeal.",
      "Associate Justice Anita Earls, the other Democrat on the seven-member court, delivered the oath to Riggs at the old Capitol building. While The Associated Press declared over 4,800 winners in the 2024 general election, the Supreme Court election was the last nationally that was undecided.",
      "\"Thank you for your trust and unwavering support,\" Riggs told family and supporters after she was sworn in to an eight-year term. \"You chose a path forward where power stays in the hands of the people, not politicians.\"",
      "The victory builds Democratic hopes that they can take over the highest court in the ninth-largest state later this decade. Earls is seeking reelection in 2026. The conservative majority in place since early 2023 has issued opinions favoring Republicans on redistricting, photo voter identification and even this race.",
      "After two recounts, the result remained in the air for months, as Griffin protested the eligibility of over 65,000 ballots. Court decisions whittled the potential ballots at issue down to roughly 7,000.",
      "Riggs' Democratic allies said Griffin and the state Republican Party were trying to overturn a fair and legal election by removing legally-cast ballots. Some of Griffin's challenges only applied to a handful of Democratic-leaning counties.",
      "The State Board of Elections dismissed Griffin's protests in December.",
      "But by April state appeals courts \u2014 including the high court \u2014 ruled against counting votes from people who never lived in North Carolina but whose parents had. And they declared ballots ineligible if they were cast by military and overseas voters who didn\u2019t provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form.",
      "A Republican majority of justices said that those people who cast ballots without an ID or form \u2014 perhaps several thousand \u2014 should have 30 days to provide additional information so their choices could still count.",
      "Riggs, who recused herself from her court's deliberations, went to federal court to block these decisions. U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, an appointee of President Donald Trump, sided with Riggs on May 5, agreeing the \u201dretroactive invalidation\u201d of ballots cast by military and overseas voters would violate the due process rights of voters. And Myers wrote the lack of a process for people mistakenly declared nonresidents also was unconstitutional.",
      "Griffin's challenges in part had been about \u201cmaking sure that every legal vote in an election is counted,\u201d he said last Wednesday as he announced he wouldn\u2019t appeal.",
      "Republican officials contend the six-month challenge brought to light errors by the State Board of Elections that threatened election integrity. But many voters whose ballots were challenged saw Griffin's efforts as a disturbing attempt to steal an election.",
      "Myers\u2019 order, however, did not invalidate for future North Carolina elections the state courts' decisions on military and overseas voters who don't provide ID information as well as those who have never been residents in the state. They can vote in North Carolina elections for federal offices only, the State Board of Elections said this week.",
      "Riggs' term lasts through late 2032. Griffin remains a state Court of Appeals judge.",

In recent years, she has worked as a middle school resource officer and was the department\u2019s employee of the month a year ago in March. After the shooting she requested and was granted personal leave and also reassigned from her post at the school.",

      "BOSTON -- Harvard University responded Monday to recent threats from the Education Department to halt its grant funding, highlighting reforms it was undertaking but warning it won't budge on \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation.",
      "A letter from Harvard President Alan Garber detailed how the institution had made significant changes to its leadership and governance over the past year and a half. Among the reforms, Garber said, was a broad \u201cstrategy to combat antisemitism and other bigotry.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Department of Education threatened a grant freeze in a major escalation of Trump\u2019s battle with the Ivy League school. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status.",

      "Illinois is getting set to close on property that officials want to buy to keep invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes",
      "A stalemate between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker that threatened a $1.2 billion plan to keep invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes appears to have been settled after the Trump administration offered assurances it will cover its share of the costs.",
      "After a delay that has stretched on since February, Illinois officials are set to resume closing on property they need to continue work on a project that will generate vast bubble curtains to deter the carp, stun them with electrical fields and play sound frequencies to disorient them.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along with state officials in Illinois and Michigan have been planning since 2020 to install a gantlet of technologies in the Des Plaines River near Joliet, Illinois, to deter invasive carp from entering Lake Michigan.",
      "The Corps and the states signed a deal in 2024 to work together on the project using $226 million allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And elements of the Water Resources Development Act adopted last year call for the federal government to cover 90% of operating and maintenance costs.",
      "Construction on the project began in January. Pritzker's administration was set to close in February on a parcel of property for the project and transfer it to the Corps.",
      "Everything appeared on track until late January, when the Trump administration froze federal grants and loans as it reviewed whether spending aligned with Trump's priorities on issues such as climate change and diversity. The administration rescinded the freeze less than two days later but questions persist about the federal government's spending commitments.",
      "Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire and a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics. He has described the early months of the Trump administration as \u201ctrue villainous cruelty by a few idiots.\u201d",
      "Days before Illinois was to finalize a property deal for the carp project, Pritzker hit pause and demanded assurances that the federal government would honor its spending commitment. Site preparation has continued since then, but substantial work to install technology has been on hold.",
      "The White House issued a memo late Friday saying the Trump administration recognized the threat invasive carp pose to Great Lakes recreation and fishing and that it's committed to protecting the lakes.",
      "The federal government is prepared to do its part so long as states cooperate, according to the memo, which calls on Illinois to complete the property deal by July 1 and promises the federal government will streamline permitting and environmental reviews.",
      "\u201cMy Administration fully supports preventing the spread of invasive carp,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThe State of Illinois, where the (project) is located, must cease further delay in cooperating with this effort, for the sake of its own citizens and economy and for the sake of all of the Great Lake States.\u201d",
      "Pritzker's office issued a news release late Friday evening saying the governor was satisfied.",
      "Work on the project isn't slated to finish until 2032, but Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Alliance for the Great Lakes, said Monday that prospects suddenly look dramatically better than they did last week.",
      "\u201cWe're back to business as usual. That's a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Four species of carp were imported to the U.S. from Asia in the 1960s and 1970s to clear algae from sewage ponds and fish farms in the Deep South. They escaped into the Mississippi River and have moved north into dozens of tributaries in the central U.S.",
      "Government agencies, advocacy groups and others have long debated how to prevent the fish from reaching the Great Lakes, where scientists say they could out-compete native species for food and habitat in waterways where the fishing industry is valued at $7 billion.",
      "A shipping canal that forms part of the link between the Mississippi and Lake Michigan has a network of fish-repelling barriers, which the Corps says is effective, but critics consider inadequate.",
      "The new project at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River near Joliet will provide another layer of protection at a downstream choke point between the Illinois River, which is infested with invasive carp, and Lake Michigan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful everyone is taking this project seriously now and we\u2019re not going to see any more delays,\u201d Brammeier said.",

      "But there are constitutional prohibitions against the president receiving gifts from foreign entities or even domestic ones. It's a conversation over emoluments, territory that Trump has been forced to navigate, and litigate, in the past.",
      "Simply, an emolument is compensation for services, from employment or holding office, that can take the form of a salary, fee or profit.",
      "There are separate emoluments delineations in the U.S. Constitution. Both are aimed at preserving the independence of the president from influence from outside entities, including Congress, states and foreign governments.",

      "Trump has reportedly been offered a Boeing 747-8 by Qatar in an arrangement that could be formalized as he travels to the Middle East this week. The Qatari government has said a final decision hasn't been made. But Trump has defended the idea as a fiscally smart move for the country, even as critics argue it would amount to a president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government.",
      "\u201cIf we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they\u2019re building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House.",
      "The luxury 747 \u2014 currently parked at Palm Beach International Airport, close to Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago resort \u2014 would be donated to a future presidential library. Trump has said that he wouldn\u2019t use it for personal travel after leaving office, suggesting that it would be decommissioned like the Boeing 707 that Ronald Reagan flew on in the 1980s, and which is currently on display at Reagan's presidential library in Simi Valley, California.",
      "There are other Trump-related deals with Qatar. Last month, the Trump family company struck a deal to build a luxury golf resort there, in a sign it has no plans to hold back from foreign dealmaking during a second Trump administration.",
      "The project, which features Trump-branded beachside villas and an 18-hole golf course to be built by a Saudi Arabian company, marked the first foreign deal by the Trump Organization since Trump resumed office.",
      "In his first term, Trump faced lawsuits from Maryland and the District of Columbia, as well as high-end restaurants and hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., that accused him of illegally profiting off the presidency through his luxury Washington hotel.",
      "In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court brought an end to the cases, ruling them as moot since Trump was no longer president. The justices threw out Trump\u2019s challenge to lower court rulings that had allowed lawsuits to go forward alleging that he violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel and patronize other businesses owned by the former president and his family.",
      "They've tried.",
      "Last year, congressional Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit U.S. officials from accepting money, payments or gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent. It was their response to a yearslong probe into Trump's overseas business dealings.",

Richard Blumenthal would enforce the Constitution\u2019s ban on emoluments, which prohibits the president from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress\u2019 permission.

      "Georgia has become the second state to provide a legal protections to the manufacturer of a popular weed killer",
      "In a victory for global agrochemical maker Bayer, Georgia has become the second state to shield pesticide manufacturers from some lawsuits claiming that they failed to warn customers of potential dangers.",
      "The legislation signed Friday by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is designed to protect Bayer from lawsuits claiming that it failed to tell customers that its popular weed killer Roundup could cause cancer. It's written broadly enough to provide legal protection in Georgia to any pesticide manufacturer that follows federal labeling requirements.",
      "North Dakota's governor signed the first such law last month, and similar measures have been considered this year in at least nine other states.",
      "Bayer, based in Germany, acquired Roundup with the 2018 purchase of St. Louis-based Monsanto. But it quickly was hit with an onslaught of lawsuits alleging that Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More than 67,000 of a total 181,000 claims involving Roundup remain outstanding, but a Bayer spokesperson said Monday that he didn't have specifics about how many of those are in Georgia.",
      "Though some studies associate glyphosate with cancer, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.",
      "Bayer insists glyphosate is safe. But it has stopped using the ingredient in its residential version of Roundup and has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. It continues to use glyphosate in its agricultural version of Roundup but has warned that it might have to stop doing so if the legal costs keep mounting.",
      "The new Georgia law is to take effect Jan. 1. That means it won't effect existing cases, such as a March decision by a Georgia jury to award nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who alleged Roundup caused his cancer.",
      "Bayer has teamed up with a coalition of agricultural industry groups to mount a multiprong campaign. In addition to pursuing legislation in states and Congress, it also has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and has run ads on billboards, newspapers, TV and radio stations and internet sites touting the importance of glyphosate in agriculture.",
      "Glyphosate has for decades been used an efficient way to control weeds with less tilling, which helps prevent soil erosion. For some crops, such as corn, soybeans and cotton, Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist glyphosate\u2019s deadly effect.",
      "Without glyphosate, weeds could become harder to control, crop yields could decline and groceries could become more costly, Bayer said.",
      "The new law \u201cdemonstrates that Georgia stands with its farmers, who work tirelessly to produce safe and affordable food,\u201d said Brian Naber, president of Bayer's crop sciences in North America, Australia and New Zealand.",

      "\u201cIn Iowa, we know it\u2019s not about right versus left, but right versus wrong,\" Sand said in his announcement. \u201cAs governor, I will always do what\u2019s right for Iowans.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an uphill battle in a state that Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2024 and Reynolds by 18 percentage points in 2022. The state has shifted dramatically in favor of Republicans since 2006, the last time there was a governor\u2019s race without an incumbent candidate.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday urged California cities to clear homeless encampments, escalating once again his efforts to address an intractable issue of his time in office: the makeshift tents that line underpasses, parks and local streets up and down the state.",
      "Newsom's administration drafted a local law that counties, cities and towns can directly adopt or modify to achieve the Democratic governor's goals. He's also releasing $3.3 billion in voter-approved funds to expand housing and treatment options for homeless residents.",
      "\u201cThe time for inaction is over. There are no more excuses,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, made tackling homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019 and since then, Democratic leaders in the state have also moved toward cracking down on encampments. The state accounts for a quarter of the homeless population in the United States, with more than 187,000 Californians in need of housing.",
      "With tents lining streets and disrupting businesses in cities and towns across the state, homelessness has become one of the most pressing public health and safety issues in California and one sure to dog Newsom if he runs for national office.",
      "His declaration comes a year after the U.S. Supreme Court made it easier for officials to ban homeless people from camping outside. It was a ruling welcomed by many Democratic leaders, including Newsom, despite pushback from advocates for homeless people who objected to the decision by the conservative court as cruel.",
      "The key provisions of the model ordinance announced Monday include prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location, a ban on encampments that block sidewalks and a requirement that local officials provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter prior to clearing an encampment.",
      "Providing a ready-made local law could bring uniformity to how cities and counties deal with encampments though Newsom is urging local officials to modify his proposal as needed.",
      "Major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have already started clearing out encampments, saying they are not fair to children, seniors and disabled people who need access to parks and sidewalks.",
      "San Francisco's new mayor, Daniel Lurie, pledged to clean up city sidewalks while in San Jos\u00e9, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times. Both cities have ramped up the number of shelter beds available so more people have somewhere to go.",
      "In Los Angeles, first-term Democratic Mayor Karen Bass has made clearing encampments a priority but sagging tents, makeshift shelters and rusting RVs remain an all-too-common sight in just about every neighborhood. An annual tally last year estimated that more than 45,000 homeless people were living in the city.",
      "Efforts to reduce homelessness are facing increased stress, as the city contends with a nearly $1 billion projected budget gap along with the massive and costly job of rebuilding the Pacific Palisades neighborhood that was destroyed in a January wildfire.",
      "A message was sent Monday to Bass\u2019 office seeking comment on Newsom\u2019s announcement.",
      "Critics say there is no evidence that punitive policies reduce homelessness and camping bans make it harder to link people up with stable housing and employment. People may lose critical documents or contact with a case manager, forcing them to start all over again, says the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "In 2024, California voters approved a measure that imposes strict requirements on counties to spend on housing and drug treatment programs to tackle the homelessness crisis. It was a signature proposal for Newsom, who campaigned for the measure\u2019s passage.",
      "Under the measure, counties are required to spend about two-thirds of the money from a voter-approved tax enacted in 2004 on millionaires for mental health services on housing and programs for homeless people with serious mental illnesses or substance abuse problems.",
      "The governor has also pushed for laws that make it easier to force people with behavioral health issues into treatment. And he has repeatedly threatened to withhold state money from cities and counties that do not step up to address homelessness.",
      "But despite the roughly billions of dollars spent on more than 30 homeless and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal years, California does not have reliable data needed to fully understand why the problem didn\u2019t improve in many cities, according to a 2024 state audit.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",

      "Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is wading into one of Washington\u2019s most contentious and intractable political problems",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is wading into one of Washington's most contentious and intractable political problems as he puts forward a plan Monday aimed at reforming the country's immigration system and beefing up border security.",
      "The plan by Gallego, who beat Republican Kari Lake in last fall's tight Senate race, calls for hiring more Border Patrol agents; using technology to stop fentanyl smuggling; reforming the asylum system; adding more ways for people to come to the U.S.; and a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants.",
      "Gallego's plan comes three months into President Donald Trump's administration as Trump seeks to deliver on campaign promises of carrying out mass deportations. His plan \u2014 or any other from Democrats \u2014 is unlikely to get much traction with Trump in the White House, but it illustrates that the debate about legislative solutions carries on.",
      "Many members of Congress have tried and failed to change the immigration system. A small group of senators, led by Gallego's predecessor, Krysten Sinema, negotiated for months in 2023 and 2024 over a border bill that would have toughened asylum protocols for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border; hired more officers to evaluate asylum claims and Border Patrol agents; and given money to local governments seeing influxes of migrants.",
      "That effort ran into a wall of opposition just hours after the bill was released.",
      "The last time Congress even came close to a breakthrough on immigration reform was in 2013, when a bipartisan group of senators pushed forward legislation creating a pathway to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally and expanding work visas while tightening border security and mandating that employers verify workers\u2019 legal status. The Senate approved that proposal, but it was rejected by the House.",
      "Gallego's plan includes some elements that likely will find bipartisan support, such as his calls to beef up border security. But other parts \u2014 like efforts to legalize anyone already in the country illegally \u2014 will prove much more contentious.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to choose between border security and immigration reform. We can and should do both,\" Gallego said in a news release Monday. He said \u201cfor decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It\u2019s time to push forward and enact a plan that works.\u201d",
      "Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, replaced Sinema, a Democrat-turned Independent from Arizona who often was on the forefront on immigration and border security legislation.",
      "Here's a look at the 21-page plan:",
      "Gallego argues that tougher immigration enforcement alone isn\u2019t the answer and that it should be paired with more ways for people to come to the U.S. legally.",
      "The plan calls for increasing the annual allotment of some visas and Green Cards and removing or significantly increasing \u201carbitrary per-country caps.\u201d He also wants to create new visa categories, boost refugee resettlement and expedite the naturalization process for immigrants who serve in the military.",
      "He also calls for gradually implementing E-Verify, which makes it easy to check if potential employees can legally work in the U.S. E-Verify has often faced resistance over concerns it would lead to widespread labor shortages.",
      "Arguing on moral and economic grounds, Gallego calls for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "There\u2019s no exact number of how many people this would encompass, although some estimates put the number as high as 3.4 million people.",
      "Gallego\u2019s plan also calls for a pathway to citizenship for spouses of U.S. citizens who are in the country illegally. President Joe Biden tried something similar last year in a program that would have covered an estimated 550,000 people, but it was swiftly held up by a judge.",
      "Noting that migrant border arrivals started dropping back in June of last year, Gallego warns that a surge can come at any time so investments should be made now. The senator calls for better pay and addressing issues like workforce safety to help hire and retain Border Patrol agents; investments in technology and infrastructure to detect drugs or human smuggling; and focusing efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on removing people who pose a safety threat.",
      "Gallego, who often speaks about the toll of migrant surges on Arizona's border towns, also is proposing money to help affected communities.",
      "Instead of having asylum cases decided in backlogged immigration courts, Gallego wants to hire more asylum officers and give them the power to decide those cases. He also is proposing making the asylum standard higher and cutting back on asylum access during border surges.",
      "Gallego argues the U.S. needs to figure out why migrants are leaving their home countries in the first place and address those problems.",

      "ATLANTA -- Single mother Priscilla Grim lost her job. Aspiring writer Julia Dupuis frequently stares at the bedroom ceiling, numb. Geography and environmental studies researcher Hannah Kass is worried about her career prospects after she graduates from her Ph.D. program.",
      "The three are among 61 defendants accused by Republican Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr of participating in a yearslong racketeering conspiracy to halt the construction of a police and firefighter training facility just outside Atlanta that critics pejoratively call \u201cCop City.\u201d",
      "Their cases are at a standstill, 20 months after being indicted under Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, which is likely the largest criminal racketeering case ever filed against protesters in U.S. history, experts say.",
      "Trial for five of the defendants was supposed to start last year but got bogged down in procedural issues. The judge overseeing the case then moved to another court. A new judge has set a status hearing for Wednesday.",
      "The delays have left people in limbo, facing charges carrying up to 20 years behind bars for what they maintain was legitimate protest, not domestic terrorism. The case also has suppressed a movement that brought together hundreds of activists to protect a wooded patch of land that ultimately was razed for the recently completed $118 million, 85-acre (34-hectare) project.",
      "Officials say the project is sorely needed to replace outdated facilities and boost officers' morale. Opponents say it will be a training ground for a militarized police force and its construction has worsened environmental damage in a poor, majority-Black area.",
      "Protests escalated after the fatal 2023 shooting of Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, known as Tortuguita, who was camping near the site when authorities launched a clearing operation. Officials said they killed Tortuguita, 26, after the activist shot and wounded a trooper from inside a tent.",
      "A family-commissioned autopsy concluded Tortuguita was killed with their hands in the air, but a prosecutor found the officers' use of force was \u201c objectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "Chris Timmons, a former Georgia prosecutor who has handled numerous RICO cases, said it\u2019s understandable such a large case would take a long time to be scheduled. But Timmons said he is surprised prosecutors don\u2019t seem to be aggressively pushing for a trial date.",
      "\u201cCases age like milk, not like wine,\u201d Timmons said. \u201cThe longer we go, memories fade, witnesses become unavailable. If I were in the prosecutors' shoes, I\u2019d want this case tried as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Michael Mears, a professor at Atlanta\u2019s John Marshall Law School who studies RICO cases, said prosecutors \u201cboxed themselves in by charging so many people at one time instead of going after the leadership.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors\u2019 decision last year to drop money laundering charges against three of the movement\u2019s alleged leaders was a sign of the case\u2019s weakness. And with the movement having faded from the public consciousness, there is less political appetite for cracking down on the protesters, he said.",
      "\u201cProsecutors can\u2019t just walk away from it, but I think you\u2019ll probably see it die a slow death,\u201d Mears said, predicting charges would slowly be dismissed.",
      "That is cold comfort for those who say their lives are on hold.",
      "\u201cI think most of our lives are just completely frozen in one way or another,\u201d said Dupuis, 26, who lives in Massachusetts.",
      "Dupuis was charged with felony intimidation of an officer in 2023 for distributing anti-police flyers near the home of one of the troopers who killed Tortuguita, Dupuis\u2019 friend. The trooper called authorities after learning the flyers, which called him a \u201cmurderer,\u201d were placed on his neighbors' mailboxes.",
      "Now banned from Georgia, Dupuis struggles to find the motivation to complete freelance copywriting projects that pay for their $650 rent.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot I want to do, a lot of hopes and dreams that I feel like are just kind of stuck,\u201d said Dupuis, who dreams of joining New York City\u2019s creative writing scene.",
      "But most of all, Dupuis misses the activist community that once thrived in the South River Forest.",
      "\u201cThe charges have ripped me away from my community and the people that I love so much. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been longing for every single day: to be back with my people,\" Dupuis said.",
      "Grim, 51, is tired of waiting and recently filed for a speedy trial. It's unclear whether her motion will be granted, since the speedy trial deadline passed long ago.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\" Grim said. \"If you think you have something on me, let\u2019s do it \u2014 which you don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "Besides the couple hundred dollars she gets each month from donors she doesn't know, Grim cobbles together funds through freelance work for activist-oriented causes and is focused on helping her daughter get through college.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had such a hard time finding employment,\u201d said Grim, who previously held marketing jobs. \u201cI do really well until the final interview and then everybody goes ghost on me. I think it's because that's when they look my name up.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say Grim was among a throng of black-clad activists in March 2023 who left a music festival, walked through the woods and overtook the construction site, torching equipment and throwing rocks at retreating officers before returning to blend in with festivalgoers.",
      "Grim said she was in her tent, having woken up from a nap, when officers arrived at the festival and began making arrests. Grim said she began to run before falling due to her knee injury.",
      "\u201cI heard men screaming at me,\" Grim said, describing what prompted her to run. \"That's scary as a woman. They didn't say they were police or anything.\u201d",
      "Authorities, however, said Grim ran upon spotting the officers and tried to hide.",
      "After her arrest, Grim lost an email marketing contract with Fordham University, which had been about to give her a full-time position.",

      "On May 12, 2022, a group of protesters gathered in suburban Atlanta outside the offices of Brasfield & Gorrie, the training center's primary contractor. Some set off fireworks as others broke windows and spray-painted \u201cTrees not cops,\u201d causing an estimated $30,000 in damage, authorities said.",
      "Kass, 32, attended the protest but said she never vandalized anything and was engaging in a research method called \u201cparticipant observation,\u201d which involves immersing oneself in the community being studied.",

      "He applied only to U.S. schools and was accepted by some. But after the initial excitement, he began seeing reasons for doubt.",
      "First, there was President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Then, China's Ministry of Education issued a warning about studying in America. When he saw the wave of legal status terminations for international students in the U.S., he realized he needed to consider how American politics could affect him.",
      "The recent developments soured some of his classmates on studying in the U.S., but he plans to come anyway. He is ready \u201cto adapt to whatever changes may come,\" he said.",
      "American universities, home to many programs at the top of their fields, have long appealed to students around the world hoping to pursue research and get a foothold in the U.S. job market. The durability of that demand faces a test under the Trump administration, which has taken actions that have left international students feeling vulnerable and considering alternate places to study.",
      "\u201cAll of the Trump administration's activities have been sending a message that international students are not welcome in the U.S.,\u201d said Clay Harmon, executive director of AIRC, a professional association for international enrollment managers at colleges.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the U.S. last year. A large decline in their ranks could cripple school budgets that rely on tuition from foreign students, who are ineligible for federal student aid and often pay full price to attend.",
      "It's too early to quantify any impact from the administration's crackdown, which has included new scrutiny of student visas and efforts to deport foreign students for involvement in pro-Palestinian activism. But many fear the worst.",
      "\u201cStudents and their families expect and need certainty,\u201d said Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. \u201cAnd they do not function well in a volatile environment like the one we have currently.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has been rebounding from a decline in international enrollment that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As top competitors such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom rolled back recruiting efforts and made immigration policies less welcoming, the U.S. appeared ready to bring in far more students.",
      "Now, a few months into the Trump administration, industry experts say it's unlikely the U.S. will be able to capitalize.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was so perfectly positioned to become the far and away, clear first-choice destination for international students,\u201d said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services. His company works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. \"Then it just went out the door.\"",
      "In Canada, where colleges saw enrollment increases during the first Trump administration, they are hoping for another bounce.

      "\u201cThis is a moment of real opportunity for the country to attract international talent,\u201d said Gabriel Miller, president of Universities Canada.",
      "The U.S. holds strong appeal for students prioritizing career outcomes, in part because of the \u201coptional practical training\u201d program, which allows foreign students to stay on their student visas and work for up to three years, said Lindsey L\u00f3pez of ApplyBoard, an application platform for students seeking to study abroad.",
      "Graduates earning this post-college work experience were among the foreigners whose legal status or visas were terminated this spring.",
      "Still, the diversity and size of the U.S. job market could help American schools stay ahead of the competition, L\u00f3pez said.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the largest economy in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the vastness and also the economic diversity that we have in the U.S., with a whole variety of different industries, both public and private, for students to choose from.\u201d",
      "William Paterson University, a public institution of 10,000 students in New Jersey, typically has around 250 international students. It expects an increase in foreign students in the fall, according to George Kacenga, vice president for enrollment management. The school has focused on designing programs around STEM majors, which appeal to international students because they open access to OPT programs.",
      "Students have expressed concern about securing visas, but most of the school\u2019s international students are from India and report they are getting appointments, he said.",
      "In Shanghai, many students in Austin Ward\u2019s 12th grade class have either committed to attending U.S. colleges or are considering it. Ward teaches literature in a high school program offering an American Common Core curriculum for Chinese students.",
      "Ward said he avoids discussing politics with his students, but some have asked him about the U.S. government's termination of students' legal statuses, signaling their concern about going to the U.S.",

      "WASHINGTON -- He was special, Albert Votaw's daughter remembers all these decades later.",
      "Cathy Votaw is 70 now, more than a dozen years older than her father lived to be. She describes a man with a larger-than-life personality and a love of fun \u2014 as if you couldn't tell that from the photos, which show an outrageous handlebar mustache and a penchant for bowties sewn by his wife.",
      "Each year on April 18, the anniversary of the 1983 bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that took the lives of her father and 62 others, a persistent sense of loss awakens in Cathy. Some years, she writes an email to her family, telling them about Albert, a public-housing expert for the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "He was, she writes, dedicated to public service \u2014 and to USAID. And she is so sorry, she tells Albert Votaw's grandchildren and great-grandchildren, that his death at the hands of an anti-American attacker driving a truck packed with explosives means they never got to meet him.",
      "Yet Albert Votaw's influence echoes down across the generations. Four decades later, as the agency that worked to promote American security through international development and humanitarian work disappears at the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two things are abundantly clear:",
      "Service to USAID shattered the Votaw family. And service to USAID reshaped it as well.",
      "In a way, the requiem of the now-dismantled agency can be told through its people \u2014 including some entire families, like the Votaws. Albert\u2019s work for USAID, and his death while on the job, steered the work of two generations of his family after him.",
      "It led his daughter, Cathy, to dedicate part of her life to working on behalf of the families of Americans killed by extremist attacks.",
      "It led his granddaughter, Anna, to work as a contractor for USAID, with a willingness to take on dangerous assignments \u2014 a proclivity that she ties directly to his death.",
      "\"When my father talked about his work, he talked about ... how he was proud of the fact that he was an American, coming over here to help people,\u201d Cathy Votaw says.",
      "Her father's time at USAID began in the first years after the aid and development agency's 1960s founding by Congress and President John F. Kennedy, who believed the United States needed more than troops and diplomats to protect its interests and advance global stability.",
      "Cathy and her sisters as children followed him on his initial postings in a career that took him to countries including Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Thailand and, finally, Lebanon.",
      "One thing Albert and his wife, Estera, a Jewish survivor of the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, loved best in his first post for USAID, in Ivory Coast, was driving deep into the countryside to where Albert and USAID were working to expand rural housing. He had a big white station wagon that Ivorians came to recognize. They nicknamed it the Bateau - the Boat.",
      "A treasured family photo captures one of those moments. Albert and Ivorian elders are deep in animated discussion, surrounded by community members craning to hear every word. Estera watches, smiling.",
      "Ivory Coast\u2019s leaders gave Albert one of their country\u2019s highest medals for his work. When he was killed decades later, Ivorian officials traveled across the Atlantic for his memorial.",
      "Back then, \u201cyou feel like you were recognized as a country for trying to do the right thing and trying to help, and in fact, contributing lives and resources to help people overseas,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful thing to have seen. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever see it again.\"",
      "After the 1983 bombing, President Ronald Reagan eulogized Albert and the 16 other Americans killed. The Reagan administration had directed USAID workers to Lebanon just before the attack, hoping their work to restore a more normal life for civilians there could help lead the country out of civil war.",
      "Days after the bombing, Reagan spoke in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base over newly returned bodies.",
      "\u201cThe best way for us to show our love and respect for our fellow countrymen who died in Beirut this week is to carry on with their task,\" Reagan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\"",
      "Over the years, the names of 98 USAID and other foreign assistance colleagues were placed on a memorial wall inside USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "One of those names was Albert Votaw.",
      "After her father died, Cathy Votaw switched from private legal practice to working as a federal prosecutor. It paid tribute, she felt, to his government service. She also became an advocate for better treatment for federal workers and other American victims of extremist attacks and their families.",
      "The embassy suicide bombing that killed her father was one of the first of its kind, though it was overshadowed by another that hit a U.S. Marines barracks and killed 241 service members that October.",
      "The Votaws and others lobbied the State Department to beef up efforts to work with families in future attacks. It worked: They won a victory in federal court designating Iran responsible as a sponsor of militants involved.",
      "And in the biggest achievement of all, survivors of attacks and relatives of victims, including Cathy, successfully pushed Congress to set up a fund for them and future victims, using billions of dollars in fines paid by entities that did business with countries the U.S. deems state sponsors of terror. That helped spur compensation for victims and family members in attacks on the U.S. since, including 9/11.",
      "Somehow, Albert\u2019s death in the Beirut bombing gave one of his granddaughters, Anna Eisenberg, a deep sense that because the worst had already happened to her family, it wouldn\u2019t happen to her.",
      "After growing up hearing of her grandfather's life and death in public service, she started work as a contractor for USAID almost as soon as she got out of college.",
      "Teaching communication skills to communities in war zones and telling the story of USAID, her assignments took her through Boko Haram territory in Nigeria, where she profiled Nigerian teachers as they schooled young children orphaned in attacks. And she worked in Afghanistan, coaching female government communication workers to speak up loudly enough to be heard.",
      "In northern Nigeria, \u2018\u2019they were like, \u2018Are you sure you want to do this? ... You're not in an armored car. You don't have any weapons,''' Anna, now 37, recounted of her trips through militants' territory. \u201cI just felt like I was able to go places ... because nothing bad would happen: 'Yeah, my grandfather got blown up \u2014 we're good.\"'",
      "In some ways, Anna was looking forward to Trump's second term for her agency. She believed that Trump, in his first term, had done a better job than most presidents at promoting how USAID built jobs at home. He'd do that again in his second term, she figured, increasing public support for an agency few Americans cared about.",
      "As it turned out, her job ended when USAID's life as a functioning independent agency did \u2014 in form-letter terminations.",
      "Albert had been jittery about his assignment to Beirut in a way he'd never been before. Still, he reassured his family, the U.S. government knew what it was doing.",
      "Just before he left, Cathy recalls, Albert's mother asked him if he would be OK.",
      "\u201c'Mother,\u201d he assured her, \u201cthey would not send me anywhere that was not safe.\u201d",
      "Eleven days after Albert arrived, the truck bomb exploded at the front of the U.S. embassy there. Many of those killed, including Albert, were in the embassy cafeteria. His family likes to think he was in his element, chatty and at a table holding forth on some story, when the bomb exploded.",
      "This year\u2019s anniversary of his death was nothing like the ones before. This year, USAID itself sat in ruins.",
      "Trump and Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency crews are slashing staffing and programs across federal government, made USAID an early target. They said most American foreign assistance was a waste and advanced liberal agendas. They shut USAID headquarters, terminated the majority of its development and humanitarian programs abroad and fired most staff and contractors.",
      "A Feb. 3 post by Musk on social media became a death notice for USAID itself: \u201cSpent the weekend feeding USAID into a woodchipper.\"",
      "A few weeks ago, at the now-closed and barricaded USAID headquarters in Washington, a crew pried off the memorial to those who died in Beirut, including the name of a gregarious public-housing expert who had a handlebar mustache and lived for, and died for, his work.",
      "The State Department said it would find a permanent home for the memorial.",

    "story": [
      "Thames Water's survival as a private company depends on the industry regulator Ofwat being lenient over fines and penalties, its boss Chris Weston has said.",
      "Speaking to MPs, Mr Weston said the firm would not get new investment if money leaked out of the business, leading to some form of nationalisation.",
      "Thames Water would struggle and fail to hit performance targets on pollution while it tried to turn the company around, he added.",
      "The troubled company is currently in talks with Ofwat in an effort to persuade it to give some leeway on fines, but the regulator has told the BBC there is a \"high bar\" for flexibility within its regulations.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "The firm is in discussions with Ofwat to put in place a \"turnaround regime\" designed to let it escape a loop where fines lead to further fines because it has not got the money to improve.",
      "Thames has estimated it could be fined up to \u00a3900m over the next five years for leaks and sewage spills which would hinder efforts to attract new investment.",

      "In addition to talks with Ofwat, Thames Water is in discussions with private investment group KKR about a cash injection of up to \u00a35bn.",
      "That deal being completed is also dependent on lenders to the company accepting a discount on the nearly \u00a320bn they are owed. Some junior lenders could see their entire loan being written off.",
      "On Tuesday, heated exchanges broke out between MPs on the Environment Select Committee and Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague, Mr Weston, and chief financial officer Steve Buck.",
      "Questions were asked about why the water company had whittled down potential bidders from five to just one, and why Thames had pressed ahead with an additional, high-interest loan earlier this year of \u00a33bn when cheaper options seemed available.",
      "Sir Adrian insisted that in both cases, those were the most credible options when the company faced completely running out of cash and being forced into a government-sponsored administration.",
      "Thames originally appealed a decision by Ofwat to limit bill rises to 35% above inflation over the next five years, insisting it needed 53% to deliver the investments needed to improve services.",
      "However, it paused its appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority partly because the process could take several months and also because it hoped to reach an agreement with Ofwat to water down fines, which would make further bill increases unnecessary.",
      "Some have bristled at the idea of Thames being given special treatment after getting into financial distress of its own making.",
      "\"Customers will have little sympathy for a company with such a poor track record on service delivery and complaints,\" said Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW).",

      "Thames Water is not alone. Heavily indebted Southern Water is also in gritty conversations with its lenders to accept a discount on what they are owed in order to attract an injection of new equity (money that doesn't need to be paid back).",

      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",

    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.",
      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",
      "However, talks between both governments are set to continue, so a further deal might be struck.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both countries was that \"neither side wants a decoupling\", while China's commerce ministry said the agreement was a step to \"lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen co-operation\".",
      "So relations between the US and China are sounding more friendly, but as we've seen so far during this Trump presidency, things can change quickly.",
      "What goods do the US and China trade with each other?",
      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones Apple iPhones made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",
      "Has either side won?",
      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",
      "The US will argue its tariff rate on Chinese imports, although lower, is still hefty at 30%.",
      "\"This trade deal is a win for the United States, demonstrating President Trump's unparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people,\" a White  House statement said.",
      "Economists at Deutsche Bank have suggested the lowering of tariffs, and last week's UK-US deal on them, means there's both \"a likely cap and floor\" to Trump's rates.",

    "summary": "How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

    "summary": "Sir Ian Diamond is stepping down due to health issues, at a time when the ONS faces a crisis of confidence in its work.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS), Sir Ian Diamond, has resigned with immediate effect due to health reasons, at a time when the ONS faces a crisis of confidence in its work.",
      "\"Due to ongoing health issues, Sir Ian has decided he is unable to give the full commitment he would like to drive the organisation forward,\" the ONS said.",
      "Last month, a report from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) laid out its concerns about the quality of the ONS's data.",
      "These concerns focused on, but were not limited to, the widely recognised problems with the Labour Force Survey which is used to measure the unemployment rate in the UK.",
      "Dr Sarah Cumbers, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, said: \"Sir Ian Diamond showed outstanding leadership of the ONS and the wider statistical system during the pandemic, helping to make the UK a world leader in delivering timely data in a rapidly changing environment.\"",
      "Dr Cumbers also acknowledged the OSR report.",
      "\"Given the recent scrutiny of the system, we look forward to engaging with the Cabinet Office and the UK Statistics Authority to consider how the National Statistician role should evolve, and to working with Sir Ian's successor to address the ongoing challenges,\" she said.",
      "The report looked at concerns around business surveys and found that ONS staff were not always being listened to when flagging emerging problems to senior managers.",
      "A lack of confidence in the quality of data makes it more difficult for the government and companies to make fully informed decisions.",
      "Since the pandemic, statistics agencies around the world have struggled to get good enough response rates to ensure their data is of the quality they would like.",
      "The regulator said it would like more assurance that the ONS has sufficient steps in place to regularly review and improve sample design and representativeness, tackling bias, survey methodology, and imputation.",
      "Under fire",
      "Sir Ian took the top job at the Office for National Statistics in October 2019.",
      "This meant he was soon thrown into the spotlight in the early days of 2020, as a key member of SAGE, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.",
      "But the challenges since the pandemic have in some ways been even harder to navigate; the ONS came under fire as the quality of official data slipped.",
      "The ONS's flagship jobs survey has struggled to gather enough responses, as fewer and fewer people completed its questionnaires.",
      "Its data became so unreliable that the UK's statistics regulator removed its kitemark of quality and MPs and the Bank of England worried they could not use its figures.",
      "The online replacement for the employment survey has been repeatedly delayed.",
      "Then, a highly critical internal report laid bare a torrid experience for those working on the replacement project that \"affected wellbeing and confidence at all levels\".",
      "Originally scheduled for September 2024, the replacement employment survey has been put back until at least next year, with Sir Ian warning MPs that it may not be fully ready before 2027.",
      "Criticisms",
      "This was not the only problem the ONS faced in 2024.",
      "ONS statisticians went on strike over the reversal of one of the most generous work-from-home policies in the civil service.",
      "The Office for Statistics Regulation - the regulator - criticised the ONS for its \"defensiveness\" when responding to questions about a new analysis of gender identity.",
      "And repeated upward revisions undermined the credibility of the ONS's estimates of the levels of migration.",
      "In April, the Cabinet Office announced a rapid review, to be overseen by Sir Robert Devereux, a retired senior British civil servant.",
      "The review will look into the ONS's delivery of core statistics and major programmes, its organisational culture, structure and leadership and its relationships with the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury."

    "summary": "The two nations have announced a deal to reduce tariffs - here's what you need to know.",
    "story": [
      "The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries.",
      "President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US.",
      "But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium.",
      "Here's an at-a-glance look at what's in the deal.",
      "This isn't a trade deal",
      "Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a \"major trade deal\" - it's not.",
      "He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress.",
      "Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs.",
      "This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods.",
      "It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.",
      "Car tariffs cut to 10%",
      "Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%.",
      "This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year.",
      "But any cars exported above that quota will be subject to a 27.5% import tax.",
      "Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US - worth about \u00a39bn last year.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover, which exports almost a quarter of its cars to the US,  said the deal \"secures greater certainty for our sector\".",
      "But car industry leaders have told the BBC the quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively.",
      "The UK currently imposes a 10% levy on US car imports, but it is not clear if there is any change to this.",
      "The US has previously demanded the tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves had indicated she is open to such a cut.",
      "Trump also announced that Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts will be able to be exported from the UK to the US tariff-free.",
      "No tariffs on steel and aluminium",
      "A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has been scrapped.",
      "This is good news for firms such as British Steel which was brought under government control as it struggled to stay operational.",
      "However, the White House said it would impose a quota on the \"most favoured nation rates for UK steel and aluminium and certain derivative steel and aluminium products.\"",
      "It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more.",
      "It is also unclear whether the scrapping of tariffs will apply to steel derivative products and whether only steel melted and poured in the UK will benefit.",
      "The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, about \u00a3700m in total.",
      "However, the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery.",
      "These are worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year.",
      "Industry body Steel UK said there were \"a number hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal\".",
      "It said firms needed to know what supply chain conditions need to be met, what the quotas are and when they take effect.",
      "Pharmaceuticals still the big unknown",
      "What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The US said both countries would \"promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals\".",
      "Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade \u2013 last year sales of these products were worth \u00a36.6bn making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US.",
      "It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at \u00a34bn last year.",
      "Most countries, including the US, imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, as part of an agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",

      "No change on digital services tax",
      "There was no change to the UK's 2% digital services tax in this deal and it appears to be a sticking point.",
      "Businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces have to pay it if they receive more than \u00a3500m in global revenues and \u00a325m from UK users annually.",
      "But this threshold is easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple.",
      "The UK reportedly netted nearly \u00a3360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year.",
      "The UK government said it had \"agreed to work on a digital trade deal\".",
      "But the US government said it was \"disappointed that the UK was unwilling to agree to fully address the tax.",
      "\"It is discriminatory, unjustified, and should be removed promptly,\" it said.",
      "No drop to food standards",
      "US beef exports to the UK had been subject to a 20% tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons. The UK has scrapped this tariff and raised the quota to 13,000 metric tonnes, according to the White House document.",
      "In return, the UK has been given the same quota at a lower rate in line with other countries.",
      "Crucially, there will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports as part of this deal, the UK government statement said, insisting that American hormone-treated meat will not seep onto the UK market.",
      "Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.",
      "The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.",
      "This is an area where the UK has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming \"Brexit reset\" with the EU - over the US.",
      "The tariff on ethanol coming into the UK from the US has also been scrapped.",

      "It was a ransomware attack",
      "There has been silence from M&S on what or who was behind the attack on its systems, but we now know it was a ransomware attack.",

      "But anyone hoping the White House will either significantly roll back its tariffs - or win major concessions abroad - seem bound for disappointment.",
      "Under the outline presented on Thursday, the 10% import tax that Trump announced last month on most UK goods will remain intact.",
      "Otherwise, the plans mostly amounted to the White House agreeing to walk back some of the import taxes it has unveiled on strategic sectors, such as cars and steel.",
      "In exchange, the White House said it had won changes - which were unspecified - that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK.",
      "\"The actual substantive items that they negotiated are pretty narrow,\" said Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"In some sense you could say they basically took the status quo, made marginal changes and called it a deal.\"",

      "US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "What tariffs has Trump announced and why?",
      "The Trump administration, which has seen markets panic at its tariff announcements, was eager to sell the announcement as significant, describing it as a \"breakthrough\".",
      "In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, who also has incentive to want to be seen as a solid negotiator, called it \"historic\", while noting there was more work to be done.",
      "Steelmakers and car firms in the UK did express relief, saying the tariff rollback would help save jobs.",
      "But it was hardly missed on anyone that despite progress, goods from the UK are still facing higher tariffs than they were a few weeks ago.",
      "In the US, most analysts agreed that substantive benefits would be limited, despite the two sides discussing trade on and off for nearly a decade.",
      "Mr Veuger noted that Trump in his first term was similarly willing to declare victory on deals with China, Mexico and Canada that experts likewise said would have narrow impact.",
      "\"I think for Trump the goal really is to have a deal and it doesn't really matter what it looks like in the substance, \" he said. \"It tells me it's not that hard to get to a deal but it also tells me there's not that much room to make changes.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements drew an unusually sharp rebuke from American carmakers, which noted that the plans made UK-made cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.",
      "Other analysts pounced on the irony of the president dismissing concerns that tariffs are driving up prices for dolls while he agrees to lower taxes on imported cars for the ultra-wealthy like Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, which are UK companies.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said it welcomed the deal but other groups representing farmers, a key part of Trump's political base, were notably muted.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation called it an \"important first step\", while noting \"more work is needed\".",
      "\"This is a good deal for American farmers ... but it is at the end of the day a fairly narrowly-focused framework,\" said Lewis Lukens, former acting US Ambassador to the UK and deputy chief of mission to the US embassy in London during part of Trump's first term.",
      "\"It gives Trump a political victory with not too much really to show behind it.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally a free-trade party, were quick to celebrate the achievement.",
      "Rep Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska, who chairs a subcommittee on trade, told the BBC he was \"pleased\" over the initial trade pact.",
      "\"This is a significant step toward eliminating barriers to American products in foreign markets and friendshoring supply chains,\" he said, commending the administration for the swift negotiations, though noting he was happy to see details of the deal were still being negotiated \"to address additional concerns\".",
      "In a note to clients after the press conference, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the announcement indicated \"rising desperation\" in the White House to ease its tariffs before they caused significant economic damage.",
      "But those economic risks are coming not from the UK, but America's relationship with China, which sent more than $400bn worth of goods to the US last year, more than six times that of the UK.",
      "Trump has hiked import taxes on Chinese products to at least 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own duties on American goods.",
      "Trade traffic between the two countries has dropped precipitously since last month, raising fears that the tariffs will lead not only to price rises, as had been widely predicted, but shortages as well.",
      "The two sides are set to have their first talks this weekend, but what will come out of them remain unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on a 90-day pause that Trump placed on some of the highest tariffs he had announced last month on partners such as the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump appeared testy when asked by reporters about his trade negotiations.",
      "\"Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?'\" he said. \"I wish they'd ... stop asking.\"",

      "The key diplomatic win here is that it leaves the UK open to do a full EU deal on, for example, food standards.",
      "Economically this US deal is relatively small, although important to very specific sectors.",
      "It rolls back on some of the trade damage done by Trump's original announcement, in particular to the car industry. An insider told me the move from 27.5% to 10% would effectively save UK car exporters over \u00a31bn from what was an \"existential threat\" to the industry.",
      "While no longer existential, this remains painful. It is unclear how the quota will function, how it will account for foreign parts, for example, Chinese batteries, and is limited to 100,000 cars. JLR's much heralded new Jaguar was launched in the US with the hope of growing this number.",
      "The flip side of this is agricultural access for the US, for example, for beef, which is also subject to a quota. Other things were notable by their absence. There was no move on the digital service tax, or on tariffs for US cars.",
      "The biggest single decision, however, is the fact that the 10% so-called reciprocal tariff stays, even though the UK buys more from the US than the other way around. This confirms that the tariff is not negotiable for anybody, and could have wider consequences.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's White House slideshow appeared to point to a rather one sided \"deal\" where the UK had offered the US \"unprecedented access\" in order to save its car industry.",
      "The US had trebled tariffs on the UK from 3.4% to 10%, and the UK has cut its tariffs by two-thirds from 5.1% to 1.8%. It does not seem very \"reciprocal\".",
      "There is an important \"but\" here. The UK and US view these numbers through very different lenses.",
      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",
      "The Governor Andrew Bailey told me that he hoped the deal would mark the first of many which would calm global trade tensions.",
      "The real win here could be that this agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet whilst leaving the door open to a substantive deal with the European Union.",
      "By maintaining UK food standards and not, for example, accepting hormone treated beef or chlorinated chicken, a \"full fat\" food and farm export deal with the EU, similar to Switzerland's, is now clearly on the cards in the next fortnight. This could slash post Brexit red tape for key exporters both ways.",
      "Then you have an overall picture of a growing economy, with good trade relations with the US, EU, India and soon the Gulf too, with rates being cut.",
      "The Government will try to project the UK as an oasis of trade and political stability in a tumultuous world, after years of turmoil. It is a world away from the recessionary negativity at the turn of the year, and it might just work.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",

      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",

    "summary": "The BBC's Emma Simpson gets a rare glimpse behind the scenes of how the fashion brand operates.",
    "story": [
      "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll.",
      "That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.",
      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",
      "But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.",
      "\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.",
      "The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.",
      "It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries.",
      "\"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season.",
      "He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema\u00a0 as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created.",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting.",
      "Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production.",
      "\"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says.",
      "Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop.",
      "In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later.",
      "Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week.",
      "Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.",
      "As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks.",
      "More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.",
      "Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands.",
      "\"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\"",
      "In other words, getting the right products to the right shops.",
      "At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand.",
      "Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales.",
      "But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year?",
      "\"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein.",
      "Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu.",
      "Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex.",
      "Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price.",
      "\"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\"",
      "Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business.",
      "The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group.",
      "Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\""

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",

    "story": [
      "French film star G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was accused by the two women of groping them during work on a film in 2021. Depardieu had denied the allegations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal.",
      "A court in Paris found that one of the women, a set dresser named Am\u00e9lie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time.",
      "She told reporters afterwards she was \"very moved\" and satisfied with the verdict, which for her was \"a victory, a major step forward\".",
      "Depardieu was also convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah, which was not her real name.",
      "The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.",
      "Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer acting for the two women, said she hoped the verdict marked the end of impunity for an artist in the film industry.",
      "\"It's a victory for two women on a film set but it's a victory for all the women behind this case and I'm thinking of all of Depardieu's other victims,\" she told reporters.",
      "The lawyer also noted the case had come to an end hours before the Cannes film festival was due to start.",
      "The judge said there was no reason to doubt the word of the two women victims, who had told the court how Depardieu had touched them on intimate parts of the body, using lewd language.",
      "He placed Depardieu on a list of sex offenders and ordered him to pay compensation of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3840) each to Am\u00e9lie and Sarah for \"secondary victimisation\", a recent innovation covering the additional suffering for the women from the trial itself.",

      "This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.",
      "After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores.",
      "At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: \"It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.",
      "\"You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge G\u00e9rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.\"",
      "Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a \"misogynist\" and a \"case-study in sexism\".",
      "Depardieu's lawyer had demanded an acquittal and called the plaintiffs' team \"more militants than lawyers\".",
      "\"They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,\" he told the court.",
      "The first plaintiff - 54-year-old set decorator Am\u00e9lie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.",
      "The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.",
      "Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.",
      "At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: \"My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.",
      "\"A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.\"",
      "He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. \"These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.",
      "However earlier this month it was reported that he had begun working on a film directed by Fanny Ardant. Depardieu is playing a magician on a mysterious island, according to media reports.",
      "Ardant appeared with Depardieu in Les Volets Verts and spoke in his defence at the trial.",
      "\"Genius - in whatever form it takes - carries within it an element of the extravagant, the untamed, the dangerous. (Depardieu) is the monster and the saint,\" she said.",
      "Another veteran French actress took Depardieu's side on Monday. In a rare interview with French television, Brigitte Bardot, 90, deplored how \"talented people who touch the buttocks of a girl are consigned to the deepest dungeon.\"",
      "\"Feminism isn't my thing,\" Bardot said. \"Personally, I like men.\""

    "story": [
      "The BBC has opened its defence in a libel case brought by Gerry Adams, who claims he was defamed in a broadcast and article which alleged he sanctioned the murder of a British agent.",
      "Eoin McCullough SC, acting for the broadcaster, told the High Court in Dublin the allegation had been \"thoroughly investigated\".",
      "He also stated it would have been \"irresponsible\" for the information to be ignored.",
      "Mr Adams denies any involvement in the 2006 killing of Denis Donaldson \u2013 who for 20 years was a spy for the police and MI5 inside Sinn F\u00e9in.",
      "A 2016 programme by Spotlight included an anonymous source called Martin making the claim against Mr Adams.",
      "Martin was interviewed by the programme, but his identity was hidden and his words were spoken by an actor.",
      "He was described by Spotlight as an informer within the IRA.",
      "Addressing the 12-person jury, Mr McCullough said the programme had multiple sources for Martin's central claim.",
      "\"Martin gave her (reporter Jennifer O'Leary) information it would have been irresponsible to ignore.",
      "\"She didn't just take him at face value. The allegations he made were thoroughly investigated,\" Mr McCullough stated.",

      "\"The article and broadcast don't mean that Mr Adams sanctioned and approved the murder,\" Mr McCullough said.",
      "\"You'll see the BBC reported that Martin had made that allegation, but it made clear it was an allegation only and it made clear Mr Adams said it was nonsense.\"",
      "He also explained the idea behind fair publication \"is a simple one\".",
      "\"A journalist is entitled to publish material as long as the material is in the public interest and as long as he or she is doing so in good faith and acts fairly and reasonably.\"",
      "He said \"great care\" was taken around gathering responses to the allegation and that the editorial processes had been \"painstaking\".",
      "Crucially, he said, it is wrong for Mr Adams to suggest the story was based on a single anonymous source.",

      "She had met the source Martin while making a different Spotlight film.",
      "While his identity is known to her, she said to publicly reveal it would likely led to him being killed.",

      "Throughout her evidence, she read from notes she had taken during her dealings with them.",
      "Ms O'Leary said she could not name any of her republican sources \"because they fear recriminations\".",
      "Referring to her notes of a meeting with one republican source, she told the court it said: \"Donaldson would have come from the top. Adams would have been aware.\"",
      "Earlier, the jury was played a video of news extracts from the 1990s onwards, which showed Mr Adams' involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process.",
      "It was put together by his legal team.",

      "Mr Loverman and Mr Bates vs the Post Office were among the big winners at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards, in a night which threw up several surprise winners.",
      "ITV's dramatisation of the post office scandal, which led to widespread public outcry about the false convictions of sub-postmasters, was named best drama series, while ITV was given a special award to recognise the show's impact.",
      "Producer Patrick Spence said: \"This story only had the impact it did because the people that watched it stood up and demanded action with rage.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr Loverman, about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed, won two major acting prizes.",

      "A wedding dress, party plans and Alan Cumming's four suits",
      "Accepting the prize for limited series on behalf of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, Spence said the response to the show proved that the public \"cannot abide liars and bullies\".",
      "He added that \"maybe it is a warning to those who are supposed to have our backs, that they'd better not abuse that power\", and said: \"Our show didn't change the law, the people of this nation did that.\"",
      "Managing director of ITV Studios, Kevin Lygo, said it was \"part of a long tradition on TV\" that such dramas \"shine a light on corruption, criminality, miscarriages of justice... but nothing, I think, has had quite the effects Mr Bates has had\".",
      "However, two of the drama's main stars Toby Jones and Monica Dolan missed out on acting prizes.",
      "Instead, best leading actress went to Industry star Marisa Abela, while best leading and supporting actor were won by Mr Loverman's Lennie James and Ariyon Bakare respectively.",
      "\"I didn't think this was coming my way,\" said James, describing his win as a \"fantastic honour\", as he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, including David Tennant, Martin Freeman and Richard Gadd.",
      "James paid tribute to Bernardine Evaristo, who wrote the book the series was based on. \"Thank you for trusting us with your characters,\" he said.",
      "Bakare, who played his lover, said: \"This award stands on the shoulders of those who came before me, those who might have been afraid to come out, to be who what they want to be, and I just say thank you for them.\"",
      "Abela, who has also played Amy Winehouse in the musical biopic Back To Black, described her leading actress win as \"insane\".",
      "She noted that she was cast in the show, about a group of young finance graduates, \"when I was in my final year of drama school, and my agent who signed me in my final year is here tonight - Saskia thank you so much for believing in me\".",
      "\"I've been filming Industry for about six years now, and Bad Wolf and HBO, the fact that they let us carry on after season one, it's mental. They're the best.\"",
      "Ruth Jones won best female comedy performance for her role in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which was broadcast at Christmas and brought the hugely popular sitcom to a close.",
      "She accepted her award in character as Nessa, beginning her speech in her alter-ego's distinctive Welsh accent and saying: \"I'm not gonna lie, this is immense.",
      "\"I've won a Bafta before, course I have, in 1976,\" she continued as Nessa. \"It was the Barry Arcade Fruit Technician Award.\"",
      "She concluded her speech - returning to herself - by thanking her \"dear, talented, lovely, kind, funny friend, James Corden, with whom I have shared this astonishing journey for the past 17 years, and without whom, Nessa Shanessa Jenkins would not exist\".",
      "There was another Gavin & Stacey reference elsewhere in the ceremony, when host Alan Cumming asked Rob Brydon to finally answer the question of what happened on the show's notorious fishing trip.",
      "As Brydon began to speak, Cumming interrupted: \"Oh, sorry, Rob. We've got to go straight on with the next award. We'll pick it up at next year's Baftas.\"",
      "Danny Dyer won best male comedy performance for his role in Mr Bigstuff, in which he played one of two brothers with wildly different personalities who try to patch up their sibling rivalry.",
      "Dyer said he was \"choked up\" by his win, before joking: \"So my acting was so bad, it was funny?\"",
      "In an expletive-laden speech, he said it had been \"an honour to share the screen\" with his co-star Harriet Webb, and thanked writer and co-star Ryan Sampson, who he called the \"best thing to come out of Rotherham\".",
      "\"He's never done the same thing twice, which is not something I can say,\" Dyer joked. \"You wrote this part, you won this for me mate, I really appreciate it.\"",
      "Blue Lights, a police drama set in Northern Ireland, was named best drama series, Alma's Not Normal won best scripted comedy, and EastEnders was named best soap, in the year it celebrates 40 years on air.",
      "The Traitors missed out on the three prizes it was nominated for, with best reality series instead going to Channel 4's Jury: Murder Trial, which restaged a trial of murder in front of two juries of ordinary people.",
      "Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning won best supporting actress, repeating her earlier wins at the Golden Globes, Emmys and SAG Awards.",
      "\"Gosh thank you Bafta, wow,\" she said. \"I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, 'little did we know'.\"",
      "She said she was so proud to be part of this show before saying co-star Richard Gadd \"changed my life\". She concluded by wishing him: \"Happy birthday, nipple.\"",
      "Rylan Clark and Rob Rinder won the factual entertainment prize for their Italian travel series, Rob & Rylan's Grand Tour.",
      "\"We didn't know what we were making when we landed in Venice,\" reflected Clark.",
      "When he saw the programme's edit, \"I said, 'we're either going to get cancelled or we're going to win a Bafta, and I'm so glad it was the latter!\"",
      "Rinder thanked the pair's mothers, \"for allowing us to be our true selves,\" before Rylan joked: \"And BBC Arts, now we won a Bafta, can we have a bigger styling budget?\"",
      "Elsewhere, Would I Lie To You? was named best entertainment programme.",
      "Panelist Lee Mack noted the show had never previously won despite being nominated eight times, and joked that Bafta's change of sponsor to P&O Cruises, which host Rob Brydon used to front adverts for, might have had an effect.",
      "\"The whiff of scandal hangs heavy in the air,\" laughed Brydon, but reassured the audience: \"I stopped those adverts five years ago, there is no connection.\"",
      "Kirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last summer after 30 years, received the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy.",
      "Wark said it was a \"privilege and an honour\" to be recognised.",
      "\"Things have changed so much and so radically since the 70s, not least the shoulder pads, the office drinks trolley, and film crews the size of football teams, but always the chance to learn and go.",
      "\"I've been lucky to interviews politicians to painters, architects to economists, musicians and a few monsters.\" She paid tribute to her colleagues, saying: \"It takes a village to raise a programme.\"",
      "BBC Breakfast's Post Office Special won the news coverage award, while BBC Sport's Paris 2024 Olympics took the sport coverage prize.",
      "Strictly Come Dancing won the memorable moment prize, the only award of the night voted for by the public, for blind comedian Chris McCausland's waltz to You'll Never Walk Alone",
      "His professional dance partner Diane Buswell said it was \"such an honour\" to win, joking: \"Chris is not here tonight, but that's what happens when he insists on driving himself to these kinds of events.\"",
      "\"He told me to say that,\" she laughed, before reading out a message on McCausland's behalf: \"After 22 years in comedy, I win a Bafta for dancing. It hurts, but I'll take it.\"",

      "\"It's definitely in the single digits,\" says singer Holly-Anne Hull, trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home. \"We don't have time for that.\"",
      "Instead, they've been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, meeting fans, filming endless TikToks and performing their song, What The Hell Just Happened, to anyone who'll listen.",
      "If they're tired, it doesn't show. The country-pop trio \u2013 Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele \u2013 are chatty, excited and focused on fun, and for good reason.",
      "They formed at school over a decade ago, and determinedly stayed together during long periods where, in their words, \"no-one was listening\".",
      "Even after a successful turn on The Voice in 2019, Charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher, while Lauren and Holly-Anne appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical.",
      "Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table.",
      "It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live.",
      "Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".",
      "It's eight weeks since you were announced as the UK's Eurovision entry\u2026",
      "Charlotte: No, it can't be. It feels like six years!",
      "How many air miles have you racked up in that time?",
      "Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint.",
      "Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side.",
      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",
      "Charlotte: I was smiling, talking. It's like I was cured!",
      "When I first heard What The Hell Just Happened, I thought it sounded like something from Six: The Musical\u2026 Then I discovered you'd actually been in it.",
      "Lauren: That was me! I was Jane Seymour. She's the one that died, instead of being beheaded.",
      "Was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song?",
      "Lauren: We wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references: Bohemian Rhapsody, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But we also said 'let's not be afraid to write the pop version of Defying Gravity'. We wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the West End tricks you don't get in pop music.",

      "Charlotte: It's so true, and funnily enough, What The Hell Just Happened was the last song we wrote, a day before the deadline. We'd got to the point where we were like 'let's just go 100% on every idea and see where it lands'.",
      "Holly-Anne: We thought we had the Eurovision Song, I would say, four or five times. Then this one came up and we were like 'OK, it's beaten all of them'.",
      "What can you tell me about your performance?",
      "Holly-Anne: We come from theatre background, so it's definitely going to be theatrical. We want to give that a girl-band, concert feeling, like you're stepping into the world of Remember Monday.",
      "There's a line in the song about ripping your dress. Is that a sneaky Bucks Fizz reference?",
      "Lauren: Oh my God! Let's say yes. We didn't write it specifically with that in mind... but if the shoe fits!",
      "Charlotte: There's loads of little Easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship. We've had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow.",
      "Do you remember the first time you met?",
      "Holly-Anne: It's impossible to tell because we were in the same sixth form but for the first year we were in different classes.",

      "Charlotte: We always had Mondays off\u2026 hence the band name.",
      "Holly-Anne: It was so important to us to keep the band alive that we just never let it die.",
      "Charlotte: At one point, Holly went on tour for a year and we flew out to Singapore so we could be together.",
      "Lauren: Then, maybe 18 months ago, we quit our jobs to do this full-time.",
      "Charlotte: We thought, if we don't throw everything in now, we'll always regret it.",
      "Were your resignation letters like, 'I'm off to be a star!'?",
      "Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher.",
      "Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.",
      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",
      "Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together.",
      "Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime.",
      "Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough.",
      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",
      "Holly-Anne: Even if we get zero points, we'll still be singing together, even if it's in my living room.",
      "What's the one memory you'll take away from this?",
      "Lauren: I will always, always remember the feeling of finding out we'd represent the UK. We've been around for a long time, and we've had a lot of 'noes' as a band, so when we auditioned, we assumed this would be another one. 'Thank you so much, but we're going in another direction'.",

      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",

    "summary": "Eurovision songwriters, judges and more discuss crafting the ideal anthem.",
    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "summary": "The city at the crossroads of France, Germany and Switzerland gears up amid global tensions over diversity and inclusion.",
    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",
      "Last year Swiss winner Nemo did wave a non-binary flag during the performance, but said they had to 'smuggle' the flag in. This year LGBTQ+ groups say they are disappointed the EBU has not relaxed the rules.",
      "\"Banning our symbols is a slap in the face for the LGBTIQ community', said Swiss group Pink Cross. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when queer communities across Europe are facing increasing hostility.\"",
      "EBU has said that the guidelines were designed to create clarity and balance explaining: \"Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\"",
      "Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump's administration is actively removing government support for diversity and inclusion measures, and he is asking partnered European institutions (including some Swiss universities) to do the same.",
      "That's why Basel, says Mr Cramer, should take a stand, even if the EBU will not.",
      "\"These are our European values. People and nations are coming together in a friendly championship. Whoever you are, if you are young, if you are not that young, if you are straight, if you are gay, if you are female, male, or if you are non-binary, this is all perfectly fine. And I think this is not just what Basel stands for, this is what Europe should stand for.\"",
      "So if everyone is welcome, how do they get there? The host country being Switzerland, punctual transport is catered for. Swiss railways is laying on hundreds of extra trains. In Basel, the trams will run 24 hours a day.",
      "And, for those who are really in Eurovision mode, there is even a karaoke tram, where passengers can take a free 90-minute journey right across town, all the while singing their hearts out."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 13:31:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The jury in the federal sex trafficking trial will be sworn in on Monday before opening statements are delivered.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of American music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is accused of running a sprawling sex trafficking operation, has heard opening statements.",
      "The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.",
      "Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.",
      "The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.",
      "Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How can I follow the trial?",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors the trial could last around eight weeks.",
      "You can follow BBC's live coverage of the trial straight from the court.",
      "How were jurors selected?",
      "Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court.",
      "The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.",
      "The \"People and Places\" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he \"felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings\".",
      "Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had \"views about hip hop artists\" or \"feelings concerning violence, sexual assault\".",
      "The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.",
      "Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.",
      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",
      "He apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"",
      "'He thought of himself as a king': The parties that led to Diddy's downfall'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",

      "'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music",
      "Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "What has Diddy said about the charges against him?",
      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail if he is found guilty?",
      "If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
      "Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses.",
      "They accused him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".",
      "A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head.",
      "How did 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs become successful?",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.",
      "His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.",
      "In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.",

      "Giving them the targeted drug olaparib before surgery greatly reduced the chances of the cancer coming back.",

      "She was diagnosed with an aggressive breast tumour in 2019 and took part in the trial.",
      "\"When I had the diagnosis I was completely shocked,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"Six years on, I'm well and cancer free. It's amazing.\"",

      "\"For my future generations, if they have got the BRCA gene, it is a new hope,\" Jackie said.",
      "Around one in 400 people carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.",
      "Cancer Research UK estimates about seven in 10 women with changes in these genes will develop breast cancer, compared to about one in seven women without these mutations.",
      "For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.",
      "Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.",
      "The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.",
      "They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.",
      "By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.",
      "Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrookes and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were \"really exciting\".",
      "\"It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer.  We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach.\"",
      "The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic.\"",
      "Prof Abraham said a larger, multinational trial is planned next year, involving some 600 patients. She predicted that if the findings are repeated, it will lead to a major change in clinical practice for more than 1,200 patients a year in the UK.",
      "Currently patients are given olaparib for a year after surgery, whereas on the trial patients took the tablets over 12 weeks pre-surgery, and at half the dose.",
      "Prof Abraham said: \"From a cost perspective, it would save the NHS a considerable amount of money because it's a fraction of the time and dose of the drug.\"",
      "Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"While this research is still in its infancy, it is an exciting discovery that adding olaparib at a carefully-timed stage of treatment can potentially give patients with this specific type of breast cancer more time with their loved ones.\"",
      "Although the trial involved only women, Prof Abraham said the olaparib results would also apply to the much smaller number of men with the BRCA mutation who get breast cancer.",
      "The trial was funded by Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca, and was supported by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT)."

      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce.

      "The mesh, which is usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue.",
      "At the point of his suspension in 2024, the MTPS said Dr Dixon's \"misconduct was so serious that action needed be taken to protect members of the public\".",
      "But, the tribunal considered that a longer period of suspension would be unduly punitive, especially taking into account the period that Dr Dixon had already been the subject of fitness to practise proceedings.",
      "As founder of the Pelvic Floor Society, he drew heavily on claims he had made in medical publications about the success rates of the rectopexy mesh surgery he pioneered.",

      "A BBC Inside Out investigation in 2017 first revealed Dr Dixon had carried out unnecessary operations and raised questions about whether he provided adequate medical follow.",

      "None of them recognise the follow up form which he had claimed to have used in publications for up to five years post operative follow up.",
      "They include Debbie Cooper Jones, a dentist from Gloucester.",

      "The treatment is a six-hour process which he has undergone every week since he was four years old, and over the past year it has increased to twice a week as he has grown.",
      "Finley's case is so rare that doctors have considered presenting it to a medical journal, as they believe he may be one of the only people whose body reacts to lipids in this way.",
      "Dr Manas Datta, a consultant paediatrician at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, who has treated Finley since he was born, said it was \"horrific\" seeing how Finley's body responded to food.",
      "\"Even when he was on breast milk, he was reacting,\" Dr Datta told the BBC.",
      "\"We had never seen this type of case before - I remember many days where Finley came to the hospital so unwell.\"",
      "Finley, from Battlesbridge, Essex, underwent more than 20 operations at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London as doctors tried to understand his condition, and how best to treat it.",
      "His mum, Rhys, 37, said: \"It's heartbreaking at times - people don't see what Finley goes through day-to-day.",
      "\"They see the happy, chirpy young man, but psychologically he goes through a lot.\"",
      "Rhys said she did not try to hide the sociable aspect of food from her son.",
      "\"He's always helped cook, we always go out to restaurants, he's always had a birthday cake,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"He might not be able to eat it, but he's had the same normality in that respect as everybody else.\"",
      "Finley, who is also autistic, said the look and smell of food did not make him hungry or feel like he was missing out.",
      "\"Having my feed is all I know, so I just see other people eating and it doesn't bother me,\" he added.",
      "How does Finley eat?",
      "Finley receives a lipid infusion via a portacath, or tube, which enters his chest and links directly to the central vein in his heart.",
      "\"We have to bypass the gastro-intestinal tract completely,\" Dr Datta said.",
      "\"Not only the fat, but he even cannot tolerate the normal carbohydrates and proteins as well,\" he added.",
      "Finley receives carbohydrates and proteins - along with vitamins, minerals and electrolytes - three times a day into his stomach via a different tube.",
      "\"I can't remember when I had [the infusion] first because it's just my life now - I can't really escape it,\" Finley said.",
      "\"There isn't a name for what Finley has\" said Rhys, adding her son called his condition \"Finley-itis\".",
      "\"There's no-one else that we know that has the lipid element infused directly.\"",
      "\"We are actually thinking about reporting this case to some sort of journal because it's such a rare condition,\" Dr Datta said.",
      "The hope is that Finley will be able to eventually do infusion treatments at home, instead of travelling to Broomfield Hospital twice a week.",
      "\"There might be a time that he is able to tolerate fat,\" Rhys said, \"but if not, we just carry on with what our 'normal' is and go from there.\"",

      "\"The hospital and all the [staff] have given me care through my life, and I just wanted to give back and raise money for them to help other people.\"",
      "Finley's mum - who completed the same abseil on Finley's behalf a couple of years ago as he was too young - said her son was \"remarkable\".",

      "Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk.",
      "BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.",

      "The 37-year-old will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16 June.",
      "Mr Spencer's lawyers say he \"categorically denies the charges\" against him and \"will defend the allegations robustly in court\".",

      "\"On 13 March 2025, a man attended a voluntary interview at a London police station,\" the Met Police said.",
      "\"Patrick Spencer has since been charged with two counts of sexual assault and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, 16 June.\"",
      "'Evidence review'",
      "Frank Ferguson, head of the special crime and counter terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"Following a review of the evidence provided by the Metropolitan Police Service, we have authorised two counts of sexual assault against Patrick Spencer MP.",
      "\"The charges follow two alleged incidents involving two separate women at the Groucho Club in central London in August 2023.\"",
      "The Groucho is a private members' club in Soho's Dean Street. It opened in 1985 and became a well-known haunt of celebrities and media figures.",
      "On his website, Spencer says he lives in Suffolk with his family.",
      "He was not an MP at the time of the alleged attacks, having been elected to Parliament for the Conservatives in July 2024.",
      "A Conservative Party spokesman confirmed that Spencer had been suspended. He is currently listed as an independent on the UK Parliament website.",

      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the language used by Sir Keir Starmer in a speech to unveil plans to cut immigration.",
      "The prime minister said on Monday the UK risked becoming an \"an island of strangers\" without stricter controls.",
      "The phrase has led some Labour MPs to accuse him of divisive language - a claim rejected by Cooper.",
      "She added the PM had been seeking to highlight the impact of rising migration in recent years and \"support for integration,\" including English language tests.",
      "She rejected a comparison made by a small number of Labour MPs, notably former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, to the language of Enoch Powell.",
      "Downing Street also rejected the comparison and said the PM stands by his words and \"the argument he was making that migrants make a massive contribution to our country, but migration needs to be controlled\".",
      "Labour's immigration plans at a glance",
      "Starmer's robust language nods to immigration failures",
      "Cooper said she didn't know whether the PM or his speech writers were aware of any similarity to a line in Enoch Powell's notorious Rivers of Blood speech in 1968, in which the Conservative MP described a future in which Britons \"found themselves made strangers in their own country\" due to immigration.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added that Starmer's speech was \"completely different\", adding: \"I don't think it's right to make those comparisons\".",
      "\"The prime minster said yesterday, I think almost in the same breath, talked about the diverse country that we are and that being part of our strength...",
      "\"I know that everybody always gets caught up in focusing on different phrases and so on, but we do have to be talking about the policies.\"",
      "Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she thought Starmer's language was toxic, she replied: \"I don't agree, no\", adding the PM was \"right to say we need to change\".",
      "Labour Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan said he understood the \"context\" in which the government had announced its new migration measures, but he would not have used the phrase \"island of strangers\" himself.",
      "Speaking to LBC, he added: \"The sort of language I use is different to the language used by others. That's not the sort of words I would use\".",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick echoed the prime minister's comments, adding Sir Keir's warning the UK could become an island of strangers was \"already\" true in parts of the country.",
      "'Shockingly divisive'",
      "The comparison to Powell was made by McDonnell, who lost the Labour whip last year after rebelling on a welfare vote,  when questioning Cooper in the Commons on Monday.",
      "The Hayes and Harlington MP said: \"When legislation of this nature is being introduced that is serious and could be contentious, it's critically important that ministers use careful language.",
      "\"When the prime minister referred to... an island of strangers, reflecting the language of Enoch Powell, does she realise how shockingly divisive that could be?\"",
      "In the same debate, Labour MP Nadia Whittome said immigrants were being \"scapegoated for problems that they didn't cause\" and that \"the rhetoric surrounding this\" risked stirring racial abuse.",
      "The Nottingham East MP asked: \"Why are we trying to ape Reform [UK], when that will do nothing to improve our constituents' lives and just stoke more division?\"",
      "The launch of the government's immigration measures on Monday follows local elections in England earlier this month that saw Labour lose the Runcorn and Helsby seat to Nigel Farage's Reform UK in an historically close by-election.",
      "Reform, which has campaigned heavily on the issue of immigration in recent years, also picked up its first two metro mayors and now controls 10 county councils, challenging the dominance of both Labour and the Conservatives.",
      "Also speaking on the Today programme, Jenrick, who was immigration minister from 2022-2023, said the public was \"sick of rhetoric, they want action\".",
      "Jenrick claimed the Conservatives' failure to reduce net migration over 14 years in power was because of \"catastrophic mistakes\" and claimed Labour's plans were a \"con by Keir Starmer to trick the British public into believing that he's going to take action\".",
      "He added Sir Keir's words \"repudiated everything\" he had previously stood for, claiming the prime minister had stood for the Labour leadership in 2020 on a policy of \"supporting mass migration\".",

    "story": [
      "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things.",
      "Firstly, as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century.",
      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",
      "There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here \u2013 and huge numbers turned up.",
      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",
      "The arguments over immigration are one of them \u2013 and what I have just set out tells you why.",
      "This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch.",
      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\"",
      "It is a phrase some, particularly on the left, regard as repulsive.",
      "Others counter that it is a widely held perception which it is high time those in high office shared.",

      "PM promises tougher visa rules to fix 'broken' migration system",

      "Labour wrestle with the many practical and political trade-offs around immigration policy, just as other parties in government have as well.",
      "In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses \u2013 can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad?",
      "Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth.",
      "The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK.",
      "Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.",
      "Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.",
      "That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now.",
      "And there is another thing going on here too.",
      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",
      "By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan \u2013 meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here.",
      "Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration \u2013 because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited.",
      "But you can be certain there will be a row about it.",
      "These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.",

      "Care providers have said the government is taking away the \"lifeline\" of overseas recruitment without fixing the problems that make it difficult to recruit UK staff.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.",
      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",

      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce.

      "Between April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacancies reached a record high of 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.",
      "By December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnson's Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation, making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.",
      "Recruits had to earn a minimum of \u00a320,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.",
      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

    "story": [
      "Co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Adrian Ramsay has launched a fresh party leadership bid with fellow Green MP Ellie Chowns.",
      "They are hoping to be elected together as co-leaders and join the contest alongside the party's deputy leader, Zack Polanski, after he launched his campaign on 5 May.",
      "Ramsay was elected as co-leader with Carla Denyer in 2021, but Denyer announced on Thursday that she would not be standing when the posts are re-elected later this year.",
      "Nominations for the leadership open on 2 June, with party members voting throughout August before the results are announced on 2 September.",
      "The Greens normally elect co-leaders every two years but Ramsay and Denyer were initially elected for a three-year term.",
      "Members voted not to choose new leaders in 2024 because of the general election.",
      "Under party rules, there can be one leader but if two co-leaders are elected, they must be of different genders.",
      "Denyer won't seek re-election as Green Party co-leader",
      "Who are Green Party leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay?",
      "Chowns, the MP for North Herefordshire, said she and Ramsay were \"ready to lead our party into its most ambitious chapter yet\".",
      "\"We need leaders who are at the heart of national politics in Westminster,\" she said, adding that the pair was \"confident that we can win power right across the country and use it to reshape the political landscape\".",
      "Ramsay said it was \"time to build on our proven and bold Green leadership\", adding that his party \"must be ready to lead - not just to speak up, but to act - and potentially to hold the balance of power\".",
      "\"We've shown we can win seats seen as unwinnable - and now we need to turn those victories into real power,\" the MP for Waveney Valley said.",
      "\"That means electing many more MPs, speaking to and for millions, and putting Green ideas at the heart of the next government.\"",
      "Launching his leadership campaign, Polanski said the party needed to build a \"mass movement\" to counter and provide a \"real alternative\" to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party.",
      "Ramsay and Chowns were two of the four Green MPs elected in last year's general election - the party's highest ever number.",
      "The Green Party also increased its number of councillors for the eighth year in a row in local elections in parts of England earlier this month.",
      "Despite the Greens' electoral success, there have been some internal divisions behind the scenes over issues including the party's stance on gender and trans rights.",
      "The Greens have also faced challenges balancing their coalition of voters, which now encompasses cities like Bristol as well as more rural areas like Ramsay and Chowns's seats.",
      "Ramsay has been vocal in his opposition to new pylons in his constituency, which some have seen as in conflict with the party's support for renewable energy.",
      "Asked about concerns over a rift within the party, Ramsay told the BBC: \"We are very focused on uniting the party.",
      "\"In fact we've done that in our own campaigns [to be elected as MPs]... That involves bringing people together who may have different views on specific issues but are united in our common goal.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former first minister Nicola Sturgeon will not back a proposal to bring in assisted dying in what she described as the \"most difficult decision\" of her career as an MSP.",
      "A new law allowing terminally-ill people to take their own life, put forward by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, will be voted on at the Scottish Parliament on 13 May.",
      "Sturgeon said she would not support the legislation because of fears around the threat of coercion and the definition of a terminal illness being too broad.",
      "The ex-SNP leader will join her successors Humza Yousaf and John Swinney, along with Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, in opposing the legislation.",
      "Life or death decisions as politicians weigh up assisted dying vote",
      "Swinney will not support assisted dying in Scotland",
      "In a post on Instagram, the former first minister said: \"I have come to the conclusion that while some of the misgivings I have about the bill in its current form could be addressed by amendments, some of my concerns are so fundamental that this would not be possible\".",
      "While she praised Mr McArthur's approach to the bill as being one of \"great sensitivity\", Sturgeon added: \"I worry about the change in the doctor-patient relationship that would result from legislating to allow assisted dying and also about how it might profoundly change society's attitude to life and death and in particular to the importance of supporting people through good palliative care to live well before dying well.\"",
      "Sturgeon went on to raise fears over the definition of terminal illness in the bill being too wide and an \"internal coercion\" that some people, especially the elderly, might feel as part of a \"perceived duty to die\".",
      "Third vote in Scotland",
      "If the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill passes, it would allow patients to request medical assistance to end their own life.",
      "However it would only be permitted under strict circumstances - if the person had a terminal illness and had been ruled mentally fit to make the decision by two doctors.",
      "MSPs will be allowed a free vote on the issue at Holyrood, meaning parties will not compel their members to back a particular position.",
      "This assisted dying proposal is the third time MSPs have voted on this type of legislation since the Scottish Parliament was re-established.",
      "A bill to legalise the measure in England and Wales passed its first stage at the House of Commons in November.",
      "The latest Scottish bill has proved divisive, and is opposed by the Catholic Church in Scotland and the Scottish Association of Mosques.",
      "The Church of Scotland is \"partially opposed\" to the legislation becoming law, but says its official position is currently under review.",
      "Last week Liam McArthur said he would raise the minimum age in the proposed legislation from 16 to 18.",
      "The Lib Dem MSP said he had considered the matter \"very carefully\" and the change was in line with legislation in the US, Australia and New Zealand.",
      "He has urged MSPs to vote in favour of the bill and help create \"the most compassionate, safe and suitable law for Scotland\".",
      "Ally Thomson, the director of the Dignity in Dying Scotland pressure group, said she was \"disappointed\" with John Swinney's decision not back the bill but she appreciated that he \"took the time to speak with dying people who are desperate for this choice\"."

    "summary": "Troop numbers are down, morale is weak and some equipment is in a poor state - will the government's Strategic Defence Review be enough to turn that around?",
    "story": [
      "On a March day this year, a British nuclear-armed submarine quietly returned to its base on the west coast of Scotland after a record-breaking 204 days underwater. HMS Vanguard had 130 crew members on board. They had spent nearly seven months without fresh air or daylight, and with little communication.",
      "Patrols of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines are supposed to last no longer than three months. But the last eight patrols have all exceeded five months, as the navy's ageing fleet of submarines requires ever more time in maintenance. It means the submariners on board are spending longer and longer underwater.",
      "A submariner who was on board one of those long patrols described to me a worrying situation in which the crew ran low on food and medicines. Towards the end of the patrol he described how hungry crew members rummaged for tins of food in hidden compartments inside the submarine. He said they even had to make bread out of custard powder, because they'd run out of flour.",
      "The navy has long found it difficult to recruit sailors into its Submarine Service, often known as the \"Silent Service\".",
      "But the case of the 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard raises a wider issue.",
      "Virtually everyone agrees that Britain's armed forces are depleted. Troop numbers are down, morale is weak, and some ageing equipment is in a poor state. And all this comes at a time of greater geopolitical uncertainty, as the threat from Russia looms large across Europe.",
      "Within the next few months, the government will publish its long-awaited Strategic Defence Review - a consultation launched by Sir Keir Starmer shortly after he arrived in Downing Street last summer, designed to identify threats to Britain and recommend how the armed forces can meet them. But there are already doubts over how much it can realistically achieve.",
      "So, as the world becomes more dangerous, what can the government do to reverse the decline - and restore the UK to military readiness?",
      "Dwindling troop numbers",
      "Politicians from all sides, along with military chiefs, admit Britain's armed forces have been \"hollowed out\". It's true for the Royal Navy and the RAF - and perhaps most acutely, in the British army.",
      "In 2010 the regular Army was nearly 110,000 strong. Now, it is struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers - not enough to fill Cardiff's Principality Stadium.",
      "Earlier this year defence minister and former Royal Marine, Al Carns, told a conference at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank, that the entire British Army could be \"expended\" within six to 12 months if it fought a war on a similar scale to the Ukraine conflict.",
      "Last summer the head of the army, General Sir Roly Walker, said the Army needed to be ready to fight a war by 2027 - an admission it isn't ready to fight one in its current state. He said the Army needs to leverage technology, such as drones, new software, and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Justin Crump, an Army Reserve Officer who heads the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, argues that boosts to technology won't make up for the lack of military hardware.  \"We have big gaps and they're not going to get filled overnight,\" he says.",
      "The government is also promising to streamline the bureaucratic process of ordering new kit - trying to learn the painful lessons of past mistakes. By the time they eventually arrive, the delivery of hundreds of new Ajax armoured vehicles will have taken more than a decade.",
      "Weaknesses in its Nato commitments",
      "Speak to any government minister about security, they'll no doubt talk about Nato. It's the cornerstone of the UK's security, the government says, and one that has only become more important since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to its Nato commitments, the UK is supposed to be able to field tens of thousands of troops at short notice to defend any Nato territory \u2013 with a war-fighting division made up of tanks, artillery, and heavy armour.",
      "But a former senior General told the BBC that in a real war it would run out of ammunition, spares and supplies within weeks or even days. Nor does Britain have much in terms of ground-based air defences \u2013 not enough to protect key military bases in the UK, yet alone its towns and cities.",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves",
      "Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground",
      "The weaknesses in Britain's contribution to Nato became starkly apparent in February this year, when a group of British MPs visited a Nato military site in Tapa, Estonia, where British soldiers are deployed (alongside Danish and French troops). The point of the base is to deter or slow down an invasion from Russia - which is just 80 miles away over a land border.",
      "Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army Officer, said the Estonia visit was like going back in time, seeing the same equipment as when he first joined the Army as a reservist in 2004: ageing Challenger 2 tanks and Warrior armoured vehicles. What one former General described to me  as \"legacy kit from the 1980's\" - old and dwindling in numbers.",
      "About 1,000 British troops are stationed at the site. At the time of the MPs' visit they were armed with some drones - though not many. Nor did they have much in the way of systems to block or jam enemy drones, either. They also have a handful of long-range artillery guns - important for land warfare. The British Army currently has a total of just 14. Even tiny Estonia has double that number.",
      "Defence sources say that since the MPs' visit, the Army has now begun to test some of the new technology it wants to introduce. They say it \"will help soldiers see further, and strike faster\".",
      "Talk of thousands of British troops being sent to Ukraine for a lengthy deployment, if there were to be a ceasefire in its war with Russia, would present another huge challenge.",
      "In the recent past the British army has just about managed to sustain a prolonged military campaign. But in Afghanistan, between 2006 and 2014, it was only fighting lightly armed Taliban insurgents. Even then it was stretched - with nine thousand troops being constantly rotated every six months.",
      "Crump says \"Afghanistan was painful enough, and we had 20,000 more people\". While he says  providing a reassurance force for Ukraine \"might be doable \u2013 it would rapidly wear us down\".",
      "Questions over the price tag",
      "The government says it is addressing these challenges with its Strategic Defence Review. John Healey, the Defence Secretary, claims it will lead to the \"biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years\".",
      "But past reviews have rarely lived up to expectation \u2013 not least because the money available rarely matches ambitions. Most reviews are quickly overtaken by events. Harold Wilson's defence review of 1966 was overtaken just three years later by a crisis in Northern Ireland; whilst Tony Blair's review of 1998 came just three years before 9/11.",
      "Indeed, when work on this review began, the US - under President Joe Biden - was still the UK's closest and most reliable military partner. Now that's less clear.",
      "There are also questions over the price tag. The review's terms of reference assumes that defence spending will be capped at 2.5% of the UK's national income, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But few in defence believe that'll be enough.",
      "One of the independent experts leading the review, General Sir Richard Barrons, has already said the UK should be spending at least 3% of GDP on its armed forces. Meanwhile, Nato's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, is pressing allies to increase defence spending to \"north of 3%\". President Donald Trump has gone even higher, urging Nato countries to spend 5%.",
      "The government's \"ambition\" is to boost spending to 3% at some time in the next parliament - which will have the added bonus of boosting growth, ministers say. Just last week Sir Keir said that extra investment will create a \"defence dividend\" for jobs and prosperity.",
      "Others think the review is too narrow in focus. A former military chief told the BBC that a review should first identify threats to the UK, and then work out how to shape the Armed Forces. It was \"bonkers\", they added, to conduct a defence review without it being \"nested\" in a broader cross-government security review.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said that boosts to defence spending \"will make Britain stronger and safer in an insecure world and will help us build a modern and resilient Armed Forces, with cutting-edge capabilities\".",
      "The defence review, they added, is \"wide-ranging and working at pace, looking hard at the threats we face and all the capabilities we need to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century\".",
      "Low morale and cases of harassment",
      "Attempts to broaden the Army's appeal - including high-profile recruitment campaigns targeting the so-called \"snowflake\" generation - have not been enough to reverse the decline. Nor have a series of slick television adverts called \"Belonging\", which aim to highlight the camaraderie of life in the forces.",
      "Last year, the UK's armed forces were losing 300 more full-time personnel each month than they'd been recruiting.",
      "In a MoD survey last year nearly six in ten military personnel rated morale as low. Just four in 10 said they were satisfied with service life \u2013 the lowest since records began.",
      "This government is trying to boost morale by improving military accommodation, plus last year's pay rise of 6% for armed forces personnel was the largest in two decades.",
      "Part of the problem is a broader cultural one: fewer people have an emotional connection with the armed forces, Crump says. The average Briton is now more likely to know someone in jail than serving in the military, he adds.",
      "Last year, the Army apologised to Kerry-Ann Knight, a black female soldier who fronted Army recruitment campaigns, after she described years of racist abuse and bullying that made her life while serving a \"living hell\".",
      "High profile stories of bullying and sexual harassment within the military can't have helped - particularly for women and minorities.",
      "The MoD has set a recruiting goal of 30% women by 2030, but they currently make up less than 12% of the regular armed forces - a figure which has hardly shifted in a decade.",
      "Britain is not alone in struggling to fill its ranks. It's a problem experienced by many western nations relying on volunteers. Some governments have now introduced some form of conscription. In March, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a plan to make all Polish men undergo compulsory military training.",
      "But there appears to be little appetite for conscription among the British public. A YouGov poll in September 2023 found that just 28% of the British public would support a one year military service. Younger people were particularly opposed.",
      "The government wants to get people interested from a young age, by expanding cadet forces in secondary schools. The MoD is also trying to keep better records of those troops who have left, and who could be recalled in a crisis.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said: \"We are committed to fixing Armed Forces recruitment and have already given personnel the largest pay rise in decades, scrapped 100 outdated recruitment policies, and passed legislation through the Commons to introduce a new Armed Forces Commissioner to improve service life.\"",
      "AI on the battlefield?",
      "Whatever comes out of the defence review, there is no expectation that troop numbers will increase in the near future.",
      "Analysts are, however, looking at radical solutions - including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the battlefield. The most obvious example is AI-enabled drones, which are already being used in Ukraine to identify targets on their own, to deadly effect. But some also envisage a future in which machines could collect data on adversaries.",
      "A large land war in Europe is now focusing minds. Senior British military officers, as well as politicians, have repeatedly stated the UK 's armed forces must be ready to fight. But there still appears to be a temptation to use their power and influence much further away from home.",
      "Last month, HMS Prince of Wales - one of the Navy's two aircraft carriers \u2013 left Portsmouth on an eight-month voyage to the other side of the world. It's the biggest UK defence endeavour this year, involving nearly 4,000 personnel, along with the support of allies, sailing to the Pacific and back.",
      "Healey says it will demonstrate the UK's ability to deploy a major military force around the world, while at the same time promoting British trade.",
      "Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a think tank, says the carrier's Pacific deployment holds a powerful symbolic importance. \"It's a message not just of deterrence against Russia, but also against China,\" she says. \"In the world as it is now, we can't look at things geographically. Everything is interconnected. It's linking together our alliances and partnerships on a global scale.\"",
      "But the deployment also highlights the challenges of trying to do more with less. Britain can only afford to have an episodic appearance in the Indo-Pacific. And the Trump administration has warned UK and other European allies to focus on their own doorstep, rather than faraway adventures. The carrier deployment is another strain on finite resources.",
      "Of course, ministers maintain that their soon-to-be published defence review really could reset the dial and restore the UK to military readiness. But so far no government has really been willing to tackle the greatest dilemma for UK defence: do less or spend a lot more.",

    "summary": "Up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled workers will come to the UK under new measures aimed at tackling net migration, the home secretary says.",
    "story": [
      "Care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper said it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\" and rules will change this year - instead requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country.",
      "The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.",
      "Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plans were \"too little\" and called for an annual cap on migration.",
      "Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving.",
      "Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.",
      "The Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week.",
      "Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said the government \"was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration\" but added targets would not be set, saying \"they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do\".",
      "The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.",
      "There will also be a \"narrower\" list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries, Cooper said, but did not give examples.",
      "Currently, roles considered to be in short supply in the UK like carpenters, graphic designers and pharmaceutical technicians can be placed on the Immigration Salary List (ISL), allowing employers to hire overseas workers at discount - set at 80% of the market rate.",
      "Cooper said the government expects those changes will \"lead to a reduction of up to 50,000 fewer lower skilled visas over the course of the next year\".",
      "As well as visa changes, the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments \"to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK\".",
      "Philp - who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - told the same programme the Conservatives would push Parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week.",
      "When asked what the cap would be, he said \"we're working on the detail to specify that number\", but it would be \"a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000\".",
      "He argued that if Labour had stuck with Tory changes net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\".",
      "Cooper also said there would be \"some changes\" to rules around international students and graduates.",
      "\"We will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards,\" she added.",
      "\"We are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, we've had problems where some universities haven't had proper standards in place.",
      "\"They've recruited people to come as international students who then haven't completed their courses, have either overstayed or... other problems with compliance of the system.\"",
      "The government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.",
      "Applications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants.",
      "And on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first.",
      "But the new rules will require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers brought to the UK on visas for jobs that never materialised.",
      "Alongside this Cooper promised \"to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers\" to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand.",
      "Nadra Ahmed, the National Care Association's executive chairman, told the BBC the changes would a \"challenging scenario\" for care homes even \"worse\".",
      "She said providers \"always prefer to have a domestic workforce\" but said it was not available.",

      "While Labour have been reviewing migration policy for months, many have suggested this week's crackdown was triggered by Reform UK's surge in the local elections, where it took the Runcorn and Helsby constituency off Labour and won control of 10 councils.",

      "Ian Lawrence, general secretary of Napo, said a review of sentencing policy by former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke \"may come to little effect\" if the probation service was underfunded.",
      "The union boss said he supported proposals to scrap short sentences for some offenders and toughen up community orders supervised by probation officers.",
      "But he said probation staff were already \"overworked\" and suggested any \"cost cutting\" could increase pressure on the service.",
      "\"I'm struggling to see how a package of sentencing reform can work without the necessary support,\"  Lawrence told the BBC.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said a \"crisis\" in the justice system had \"put a huge strain on the probation service\".",
      "\"We are hiring 1,300 new probation officers, investing in technology to cut back on admin, and increasing focus on those offenders who pose the greatest risk to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"This will ease pressure on the service, help cut reoffending and keep our streets safe.\"",
      "Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review.",
      "The review comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a new high.",
      "In an interim report, Gauke warned that unless radical changes were made, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells by early next year.",
      "Gauke's sentencing review is expected to be published this month, before the government sets out its spending plans for departments in June.",
      "\"Napo would welcome any initiatives to reduce the numbers of people in our prison estate,\" Lawrence said.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has outlined plans for efficiency savings and in her spring statement, said day-to-day government spending would fall by \u00a36.1bn per year by 2030.",
      "But the chancellor has not yet stated which departments will have less money to spend, meaning it's not clear how the probation service will be affected.",
      "The money allocated to government departments for the three years beyond 2025-26 will be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "Lawrence said a reduction in funding for the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the probation service, could mean less funding to support offenders in the community and worse outcomes.",
      "\"In other words, they go out of prison and they've got no option but to commit crime because they have no means of supporting themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"They're back in prison within weeks. And so it goes on and that costs the taxpayer millions.\"",

      "Pay dispute",
      "In a national inspection report, the probation watchdog said there was a high shortfall of officers in some regions and workloads were a problem.",
      "Lawrence said Napo was in dispute with the prison and probation service over pay progression and workloads.",
      "He said the union had submitted a claim for a 12% pay rise for probation staff this year.",
      "That's way above the increases independent pay review bodies have advised the government to give teachers (4%) and NHS workers (3%).",

      "\"We think senior leaders in [the service] have a responsibility to let ministers know the gravity of the situation,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK.",
      "The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January.",
      "But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK.",
      "Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.",
      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",
      "\"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\".",
      "At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance.",
      "\"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said.",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",
      "What's in the deal?",
      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously.",
      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",
      "\"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said.",
      "What's the reaction?",
      "UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector.",
      "\"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said.",
      "Other business groups expressed more uncertainty.",
      "\"It's better\u00a0than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade.",
      "\"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\"",
      "While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.",
      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development.",
      "\"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\"",
      "Win for US ranchers?",
      "The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time.",
      "But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK.",
      "It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes.",
      "The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports.",
      "While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement.",
      "Other issues loom.",
      "Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines.",
      "The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\".",
      "But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\"."

      "A Labour MP has raised fresh concerns over the government's failure to properly monitor whether migrants leave the UK after their visas expire.",
      "The UK does not record all individuals leaving the country through border checks,  relying instead on matching flight, sea, and rail  passenger data with visa records.",
      "The government has promised to set out plans to crack down on record-high levels of migration in the next few weeks.",
      "But former Blair-era minister Clive Betts warned the border system \"continue to fail\" without proper exits checks leaving a risk of people staying illegally and working in \"the black economy\".",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Has the government really 'returned' 24,000 people?",
      "Net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, and then fell to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",
      "But the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has admitted the figures are not completely accurate and are instead an \"experimental\" statistic - which has previously led to the systematic underestimating of EU migrants and overestimating of others.",
      "New rules introduced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a bid to reduce migration levels are thought to have contributed to the latest fall in numbers.",
      "Since April 2024, those apply for a visa have needed a job offer with a salary at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum.",
      "The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales.",
      "During an evidence session of the Public Accounts Committee, Marc Owen, the director for visa status said his team \"were not tracking every single individual\" working in the UK.",
      "Pressed by Betts at the committee, Mr Owen said the government \"can only know\" if someone has left the country by matching airline passenger data with visa records.",
      "Instead of tracking exits, the Home Office relies on employers carrying out visa checks and enforcement squads to catch those overstaying their visas.",
      "\"We use our immigration enforcement services to visit illegal working places on the basis of intelligence and to collect people and to return them as they can,\" he said.",
      "Home Office Permanent Secretary Dame Antonia Romeo said overstaying is \"a problem\" the department is now \"fixing,\" with support from HMRC and local councils.",
      "\"We're not saying it's been solved,\" she said. \"We are identifying the issues and putting in place fixes.\"",
      "The Home Office were also working to modernise border security and boost digital checks, Mr Owen said.",
      "Currently the Home Office do not know who is \"here or not, that is the reality\", Betts said.",
      "Visa holders who have not \"gone through your systems they just disappear and they're in the black economy,\" he warned.",
      "Betts told the BBC the lack of exit checks were the symptom of a \"general failure of the border system over several governments\" leading to a splintered fight against abuse of the system.",
      "Betts urged the government to make visa checks the backbone of its new immigration plan, expected imminently.",
      "Full details of government's immigration plans are due to be published in a new immigration white paper later in May.",
      "A Home Office spokesperson has previously said: \"Under our plan for change, our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system.\"",

      "Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday.",
      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",
      "Could Thursday be 'the new Friday' for Londoners?",
      "Homeworkers get 24 more minutes of sleep a day",
      "Mr Swinney, director of the Centre for Cities think tank, was among various experts giving evidence to a special House of Lords committee set up earlier this year to examine the impact of remote and hybrid working in the UK.",
      "Last month, the think tank published research on the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024.",
      "The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week.",
      "But a similar pattern was not seen in the data for nine other large British cities, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield.",
      "Surveys have shown Friday has become the most popular day for office workers to work from home, with attendance during the middle of the week returning to more similar levels to before the Covid pandemic.",
      "'Shift to weekend'",
      "Explaining the spending data to peers on Thursday, Mr Swinney said that in London \"the Friday night drink hasn't so much gone away, it's just shifted to a Thursday\".",
      "\"But when we looked at other large cities, that wasn't the case,\" he added.",
      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",
      "\"Actually the shift seems to go into the weekend, which seems to be workers coming in from a leisure perspective, rather than going out after work\".",
      "The data analysed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialise than in the capital.",
      "Supermarket spending",
      "Elsewhere in the session, Mr Swinney said a decline in city-centre spending since the rise in remote and hybrid working had not been matched by an equivalent rise in spending on \"local High Streets\".",
      "\"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee.",
      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",
      "He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility.",
      "But he added it could be \"two, three, ten years down the line\" before the long-term impact on economic productivity could be properly assessed.",

      "\"If we had people who went to prison who didn't get drugs and weren't intimidated by serious organised criminals, they'd be far more likely to engage with a sentence and get well enough so that when they leave they don't commit further crime.\"",
      "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister",
      "The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",
      "The total number of people fitted with an electronic monitoring device in England and Wales on 30 June 2024 was 20,893, an increase of 17% on the previous year.",
      "There are three types of ankle tags currently used to monitor offenders: alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.",
      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",
      "\"We inherited a contract with Serco and it's been far from perfect,\" Lord Timpson says. \"We're putting a lot of pressure still on them to perform, but we need to work together to make sure that people are tagged on time in the right way. Things are getting better, but we're not there yet.\"",
      "Anthony Kirby, Serco Group CEO, told the BBC he is pleased the prisons minister has recognised the progress Serco has made since taking over the electronic monitoring service: \"We are proud of the role we have supporting the Criminal Justice System, monitoring record numbers of people in the community and protecting public safety in partnership with HMPPS.\"",

      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",

      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",

      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",

      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",

      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",

      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",

      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",

      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",

      "The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China.",
      "The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them.",
      "Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as \"more precious than gold dust\".",
      "\"Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,\" he says.",
      "After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth.",
      "Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.",
      "China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons R\u00fcmker.",
      "A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia.",
      "It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race.",
      "Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries.",
      "The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe.",

      "Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.",
      "That is the Moon dust.",
      "It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey.",
      "And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total.",

      "In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened.",
      "She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface.",
      "\"I'm extremely excited,\" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade.",

      "After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs.",
      "In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires.",
      "Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases.",
      "This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples.",
      "James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust.",
      "He shows us a test run of what he will do.",
      "\"I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,\" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen.",
      "\"It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,\" he says.",

      "In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows.",
      "\"I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,\" says Prof Anand.",

      "\"It's not very nice if you've got people coming down to visit, and all they can see is rubbish.\"",
      "'Heart-breaking'",
      "Fellow Splott resident Lynne Thomas, who organises monthly volunteer litter picks, said much of the litter was caused by people incorrectly putting their bins out.",
      "\"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said.",

      "She urged people to \"be proactive and help each other out\" by joining litter picks, and reporting dumped waste to the council.",
      "The illegal dumping of waste, known as fly-tipping, is also an issue in the area.",
      "\"[This] is obviously an illegal fly-tip of what looks like domestic waste,\" explained Gareth Davies from Keep Wales Tidy, in reference to a large pile of rubbish in a gully between the housing estate and a main road.",
      "\"Often this isn't local residents, but rather people fly-tipping in other people's communities,\" he said.",

      "It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.",

    "story": [
      "Chris Pelkey died in a road rage shooting in Arizona three years ago.",
      "But with the help of artificial intelligence, he returned earlier this month at his killer's sentencing to deliver a victim's statement himself.",
      "Family members said they used the burgeoning technology to let Mr Pelkey use his own words to talk about the incident that took his life.",
      "While some experts argue the unique use of AI is just another step into the future, others say it could become a slippery slope for using the technology in legal cases.",
      "His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC.",
      "Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be.",
      "\"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\"",
      "\"I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues.",
      "The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona.",
      "The Arizona judge who oversaw the case, Todd Lang, seemed to appreciate the use of AI at the hearing. He sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.",
      "\"I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" Judge Lang said. \"I feel that that was genuine.\"",
      "Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing.",
      "Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.",
      "And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed.",
      "\"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said.",
      "But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets.",
      "While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.",
      "\"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.",
      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",

      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",

      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",

      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",

      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",

      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",

It means families having only handfuls of minutes to flee for their lives, from an area that might be hit immediately to one that might be hit later. Hundreds of thousands have done so repeatedly since the war began.",
      "Gaza was one of the most overcrowded places on earth before the war. Israel's plan is to force as many Gazans as possible into a tiny area in the south, near the ruins of the town of Rafah, which has been almost entirely destroyed.",
      "Before that happens, the UN humanitarian office estimates that 70% of Gaza is already effectively off limits to Palestinians. Israel's plan is to leave them in an even smaller area. The UN and leading aid groups reject Israeli claims that Hamas steals and controls food that comes into Gaza. They have refused to cooperate with a scheme proposed by Israel and the US that would use private security firms, protected by Israeli troops, to distribute basic rations.",
      "Far from Gaza, in London, I talked to Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of Unrwa, the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. He told me that he was running out of words \"to describe the misery and the tragedy affecting the people in Gaza. They have been now more than two months without any aid\".",
      "\"Starvation is spreading, people are exhausted, people are hungry... we can expect that in the coming weeks if no aid is coming in, that people will not die because of the bombardment, but they will die because of the lack of food. This is the weaponisation of humanitarian aid.\"",
      "If words are not enough, look at the most authoritative data-driven assessment of famine and food emergencies in the regular reports issued by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC. It is a joint venture by UN agencies, aid groups and governments that measures whether a famine is happening.",
      "The latest IPC update says Gaza is close to famine. But it says that the entire population, more than two million people, almost half of whom are children, is experiencing acute food insecurity. In plain English, that means they are being starved by Israel's blockade.",
      "The IPC says that 470,000 Gazans, 22% of the population, are in a classification it calls \"Phase 5 \u2013 catastrophe.\" The IPC defines it as a condition in which \"at least one in five households experience an extreme lack of food and face starvation resulting in destitution, extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death.\"",
      "In practical terms, the phase five classification, the most acute used by the IPC, estimates that \"71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers will need urgent treatment for acute malnutrition\".",
      "Thousands of tons of the food, medical aid and humanitarian supplies that they need are sitting only a few miles away, on the other side of the border in Egypt.",
      "In London I asked Mr Lazzarini whether he agreed with those who have accused Israel of denying food and humanitarian aid to civilians as a weapon of war.",
      "\"I have absolutely no doubt,\" he said, \"that this is what we have witnessed during this last 19 months, especially during this last two months. That's a war crime. The quantification will come from the ICJ [International Court of Justice] not from me, but what I can say, what we see, what we observe, food and humanitarian assistance is indeed being used to meet the political or military objective in the context of Gaza.\"",
      "I asked Mr Lazzarini whether the blockade, on top of a year and half of war and destruction, might amount to genocide. That is the accusation against Israel levelled by South Africa and other states at the ICJ in The Hague.",
      "\"Listen, by any account, the destruction is massive. The number of people who have been killed is huge and certainly underestimated. We have seen the systematic destruction also of a school, of a health centre. People have been constant pinballs within Gaza, moving all the time. So there is absolutely no doubt that we are talking about massive atrocities. Genocide? It could end up to genocide. There are many elements which could go in this direction.\"",
      "Israel's defence minister Israel Katz has made no secret of Israel's tactics. Last month Katz said that the blockade was a \"main pressure lever\" to secure victory over Hamas and to get the all the hostages out. The National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir agreed. He wrote that: \"The cessation of humanitarian aid is one of the main levers of pressure on Hamas. The return of aid to Gaza before Hamas gets on its knees and releases all of our hostages would be a historic mistake.\"",
      "Netanyahu's plans for another offensive, and the remarks made by Katz, Ben-Gvir and others, horrified Israeli families with hostages still inside Gaza. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum which represents many of them, said minister Katz was pushing an \"illusion... Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages.\"",
      "Dissident Israeli military reservists also protested, saying that they were being forced to fight again not for Israeli security but for the political survival of the Israeli government. In the air force reserve, 1,200 pilots signed an open letter saying that prolonging the war served mainly \"political and personal interests and not security ones\". Netanyahu blamed a small group of \"bad apples\" for the open letter.",
      "For many months Netanyahu and his government have also accused Mr Lazzarini of lying. One official report posted online in January of this year was headed \"Dismantling Unrwa Chief Lazzarini's Falsehoods\". It claimed that he had \"consistently made false statements which have profoundly misinformed the public debate on this issue\". Unrwa, Israel says, has been infiltrated and exploited by Hamas to an unprecedented degree. It says some Unrwa employees took part in the attacks of 7 October.",
      "Mr Lazzarini denies the personal accusations directed at him by Israel and the broader ones aimed at Unrwa. He says Unrwa investigated 19 staff named by Israel and concluded nine of them may have a case to answer. All 19 were suspended. Mr Lazzarini said that since then Unrwa had received \"hundreds of allegations from the State of Israel. Each time, as a rule-based organisation, we keep asking for substantiated information\". He said they had never received it.",
      "All wars are political, and none more than the ones between Israel and the Palestinians. The war engages and enrages the outside world as well the belligerents.",
      "Israel argues that self-defence justifies its actions since 7 October 2023 when Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others attacked Israel, killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Any other government, it says, would have done the same.",
      "Palestinians and an increasingly concerned and outraged chorus of states, including some of Israel's key European allies, say that does not justify the continuation of the most devastating assault on Palestinians since the war of 1948, when Israel gained its independence, which Palestinians call \"the catastrophe\".",
      "Even President Trump shows signs of distancing himself from Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that the people of Gaza must be fed.",
      "The allegation that the total denial of food to Gazan civilians is more evidence of an Israeli genocide against Palestinians has outraged Benjamin Netanyahu, his government and many Israeli citizens. It produced rare political unity in Israel. The leader of the opposition Yair Lapid, normally a stern critic of Netanyahu, condemned \"a moral collapse and a moral disaster\" at the ICJ.",
      "Genocide is defined as the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. The International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate body, has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister on war crimes charges, which they reject. The three Hamas leaders who were also the subject of ICC warrants have all been killed by Israel.",
      "It is not too soon to think about the longer-term impact of this devastating war, even though its end is not in sight. Mr Lazzarini told me that \"in the coming years we will realise how wrong we have been\u2026 on the wrong side of the history. We have under our watch let a massive atrocity unfold.\"",
      "It started, he said, with the Hamas attacks on Israel on the 7 October: \"The largest killing of Israeli and Jewish in the region since World War II\" had been followed by a \"massive\" military response by Israel.",
      "It was, he said, \"disproportionate, basically almost leading to the annihilation of an entire population in their homeland... I think there is a collective responsibility from the international community, the level, the passivity, the indifference being shown until now, the lack of political, diplomatic, economic action. I mean, it's absolutely monstrous, especially in our countries where we have said 'never again'.\"",
      "Ahead may be an attempt to realise Donald Trump's dangerous fantasy of Gaza as the Dubai of the Mediterranean, rebuilt and owned by America and without Palestinians. It has given shape to cherished dreams of Israeli extremists who threaten of the removal of Palestinians from the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean.",
      "Whatever lies ahead, it will not be peace.",

      "Putin had initially called for direct talks in Turkey's largest city \"without pre-conditions\", before Zelensky announced that he would go in person and expected the Russian president to travel as well.",
      "The US is also expected to send a high-level delegation.",
      "By confirming his visit to Turkey at Tuesday's briefing, Zelensky clearly sought to intensify pressure on Russia to respond. The Kremlin has already warned that exerting pressure on Moscow is \"useless\" and it does not respond to ultimatums.",
      "Russia has instead sought to focus on a long-term settlement that tackles what Moscow sees as the \"root causes\" of the war - a set of tough pre-conditions set before the 2022 invasion and repeatedly rejected by Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said while he was prepared to meet Putin in Istanbul his priority was to secure a 30-day ceasefire, which he said all Ukraine's allies - including the US - were agreed on.",

      "In 2022 dozens of people were arrested, many of them Reichsb\u00fcrger, for plotting to overthrow the German government in Berlin. They were accused of planning a violent coup, which included kidnapping the health minister, to create \"civil war conditions\" to bring down German democracy.",

      "Zambia's foreign minister has warned diplomats against interfering in the country's affairs, days after the US ambassador raised concerns about the \"systematic theft\" of drugs donated to the southern African state.",
      "Mulambo Haimbe said there was an \"increasing tendency\" by envoys to ignore diplomatic channels, and this could undermine the \"spirit of mutual respect\".",
      "He did not name anyone, but his comments were seen as being directed at the US ambassador to Lusaka, Michael Gonzales.",
      "Last week, Gonzales called a press conference to announce that the US was cutting $50m (\u00a337m) of health aid to Zambia because of the theft of life-saving medications that the US had provided for patients.",
      "He added that he had decided to go public after holding more than 30 fruitless meetings with senior Zambian officials.",
      "In his response, Haimbe said that addressing the government through the media amounted to interference and was in breach of diplomatic conventions.",
      "\"We remain open to addressing any matters of concern through appropriate diplomatic channels,\" the minister added.",
      "Last week, the US embassy said it had presented its findings of the alleged corruption to Zambian officials in April last year, and had offered help to stop further theft and to bring the culprits to justice.",

      "Zambia's Health Minister Elijah Muchima earlier said the problem of theft predated the current government, which took office in 2021.",
      "Muchima also said several Zambian officials had been sacked following the thefts identified by the US, and that \"an advanced digital stock tracking system\" had been set up to monitor the supply of medicines.",

    "story": [
      "As the noise and colour of a two-month election campaign subsides, a game of thrones between the two most powerful families in the Philippines resumes.",
      "President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, and his Vice-President, Sara Duterte, are embroiled in a bitter feud, and a battle for power.",
      "As allies they won a landslide victory in the last presidential election in 2022.",
      "But as their relationship has fractured - he accusing her of threatening to assassinate him, she accusing him of incompetence and saying she dreamed of decapitating him - this mid-term election has become a critical barometer of the strength of these two political dynasties.",
      "And the results were not great news for the Marcos camp. Typically incumbent presidents in the Philippines get most of their picks for the senate elected in the mid-term election. The power of presidential patronage is a significant advantage, at least it has been in the past.",
      "But not this time.",
      "Only six of the 12 winning senators are from the Marcos alliance, and of those one, Camille Villar, is only half in his camp, as she also accepted endorsement from Sara Duterte.",
      "Four of the senators are in the Duterte camp, including the president's sister Imee Marcos. Two were in the top three vote-winners, ahead of any Marcos candidate.",
      "For a sitting president, this is a poor result.",
      "Senators are elected on a simple, nationwide vote, which is a good indication of national opinion. The result could weaken the authority of the Marcos administration in the last three years of his term, and it casts doubt on the plan to incapacitate Sara Duterte by impeaching her.",
      "The Marcos-Duterte relationship has been deteriorating almost since the start of their administration three years ago. But it was only this year that it ruptured completely.",
      "The decision by the president's allies in Congress to start impeaching the vice-president was the first irreparable breach.",
      "Then in March President Marcos sent Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs. The police have also now filed criminal charges against her.",
      "The gloves were off. Impeachment would result in Sara Duterte being barred from public office, ending her ambition to replace President Marcos at the next election.",
      "Right now she is the frontrunner, and few doubt that, if successful, she would use the power of the presidency to seek vengeance against the Marcos's.",
      "But impeachment requires two thirds of the 24-seat senate to vote for it, which is why this mid-term election mattered so much to both camps.",
      "Politics in the Philippines is a family business. Once a family achieves political power, it holds onto it, and passes it around the various generations.",
      "While there are around 200 influential families, the Dutertes and Marcoses sit at the top of the pyramid.",
      "The Marcoses have been in politics for 80 years. The current president's father ruled from 1965 to 1986, imposing martial law, and plundering billions of dollars from the national purse.",
      "Bongbong Marcos' mother, Imelda, who at the age of 95 cast her vote in this election from a wheelchair, is an even more notorious figure, and not just for her shoe collection.",
      "His sister Imee has been re-elected to the senate, thanks to her decision to defect to the Duterte camp.",
      "His eldest son Sandro is a congressman, and his cousin Martin Romualdez is speaker of the lower house and a likely presidential candidate in 2028 - probably the reason why Bongbong Marcos was so keen to drive through the impeachment of Sara Duterte.",
      "In the president's home province of Ilocos Norte, his wife's cousin has been elected governor, his nephew elected vice-governor, and two other cousins elected as city councillors. Up there, Marcoses always win.",
      "Much the same is true of the Dutertes in their stronghold in Davao at the other end of the country.",
      "Even from his prison cell in The Hague, former President Duterte ran for mayor of Davao, and won easily, even though all voters got to see of him was a life-size cardboard cutout.",
      "His absence will not matter though, because the previous mayor was his son Sebastian, who now takes over the vice-mayor's job. Dutertes have been mayors of Davao for 34 out of the last 37 years.",
      "The problem confronting both camps is that the senators also typically come from big political families, or are celebrities in their own right \u2013 many candidates come from a media or showbiz background.",
      "They have interests and ambitions of their own. Even if officially allied with one camp or the other, there is no guarantee they will stay loyal, especially on the issue of impeachment.",
      "\"Senators in the Philippines are very sensitive to national public opinion, because they imagine themselves as vice presidents or presidents in-waiting,\" says Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist who runs WR Numero Research, which monitors public opinion.",
      "\"So, they are always trying to read the public mind, and side with public opinion because of their future political ambitions.\"",
      "In recent months public sentiment has not been on the president's side.",
      "Bongbong Marcos has never been a good public speaker, and his stage appearances in the campaign did little to lift his flagging popularity.",
      "His management of the economy, which is struggling, gets low marks in opinion polls, and his decision to detain former President Duterte and send him to the International Criminal Court is being portrayed by the Duterte family as a national betrayal.",
      "At an impromptu rally in Tondo, a low-income neighbourhood in Manila's port area, Sara Duterte played an emotionally-charged video of the moment her father was taken into custody at Manila's international airport and put on a private jet to The Hague. She portrayed this as unforgivable treatment of a still popular former president.",
      "\"They didn't just kidnap my dad, they stole him from us,\" she told the cheering crowd.",
      "Also on stage was President Marcos's elder sister Imee, who disagreed with the extradition and jumped ship to the Duterte camp \u2013 though most observers view this as a cynical move to capitalise on Duterte popular support, so she could lift her own flagging campaign to retain her senate seat.",
      "It worked. From polling low through much of the campaign, Imee Marcos managed to scrape into the \"magic twelve\", as they call the winning senators.",
      "What happens now is difficult to predict, but the Marcos camp certainly faces an uphill battle to get Sara Duterte impeached.",
      "Bongbong Marcos: The Philippine president battling the Dutertes",
      "Sara Duterte: The 'alpha' VP who picked a fight with Philippines' president",
      "Of the 24 senators, only a handful are automatically loyal to the president. The rest will have to be persuaded to go along with it, , and that won't be easy.",
      "This election has shown that the Dutertes still have very strong public support in some areas, and some in the Marcos election alliance are already on record as saying they oppose impeaching the vice-president. The same goes for the 12 senators who were not up for election this year.",
      "One bright spot for the president could be the surprise election of senators Bam Aquino and Francis Pangilinan, both from the liberal wing of politics.",
      "Few polls had predicted their wins, which suggest a public desire for politicians outside the Marcos-Duterte feud.",
      "Neither is a friend of the Marcos clan \u2013 liberals were the main opposition to the Marcos-Duterte team in the 2022 election.",
      "But they were strongly opposed to the strongman style of former President Duterte, and may fear his pugnacious daughter becoming president in 2028. That may be enough to get them to vote for impeachment.",
      "The impeachment trial is expected to start in July. The Dutertes can be expected to continue chipping away at the president's battered authority in public, and both camps will be lobbying furiously behind the scenes to get senators onto their side.",
      "No president or vice-president has ever been successfully impeached in the Philippines. Nor have any president and vice president ever fallen out so badly.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs used fame and violence to sexually abuse women, prosecutors have said in opening statements at the hip-hop mogul's trial, while the rapper's attorneys defended his \"swinger\" lifestyle.",
      "The 55-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",

      "His testimony was followed by a man who said Mr Combs abused his ex-girlfriend during paid sexual encounters with the couple.",
      "Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.",
      "After seating a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates on Monday morning, the government and Mr Combs' lawyers outlined their cases.",

      "She focused on the two central alleged victims in the case - Mr Combs' former girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, and another unnamed former girlfriend.",

      "At the heart of the government's case is a surveillance video that shows Mr Combs beating Ms Ventura and dragging her by the hair in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Combs said the video was evidence of Mr Combs' \"flawed\" character, but not of a larger criminal enterprise. \"Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,\" said Teny Geragos, Mr Combs' attorney.",
      "Ms Geragos said Mr Combs has a \"bit of a different sex life\" - and shifted the focus to the women accusing him, calling them \"capable, strong women\" who chose to stay with the rapper.",
      "They had \"the freedom to make the choices that they made\", Ms Geragos argued.",
      "Prosecutors' first witness, a former security guard named Israel Florez, worked at the hotel, the site of a surveillance video showing Mr Combs attacking his ex-girlfriend. The clip, which CNN released last year, was played for jurors on Monday.",
      "Mr Florez told jurors that morning on 5 March 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles he received a call about a \"woman in distress\" on the sixth floor.",
      "He said he found Mr Combs there in a towel, slouched on a chair with a \"devilish\" look on his face, and a broken vase on the floor. Ms Ventura sat cowering in the corner with her face covered, Mr Florez said.",
      "Mr Florez told prosecutors that Ms Ventura kept saying she wanted to leave, but Mr Combs told her she could not.",
      "He testified that Ms Ventura had a purple eye, but did not want to call police and she eventually left in a black SUV.",
      "Mr Florez alleged that later, to \"make it go away\", Mr Combs tried to hand him a wad of cash, but he declined.",
      "Attorneys for Mr Combs tried to poke holes in Mr Florez's claims, asking why he did not include certain details - like Ms Ventura's purple eye  - in an incident report he filed afterwards.",
      "His testimony was followed by Daniel Phillip, a former manager of male strippers, who said he met Mr Combs and Ms Ventura after his boss asked him to fill in as a stripper for a bachelorette party.",
      "But, Mr Phillip said, he was greeted at a hotel instead by Ms Ventura, who told him it was her birthday and her husband wanted to give her a gift.",
      "Mr Phillip told the court he would go on to have sex with Ms Ventura on several occasions - encounters that lasted as long as 10 hours, sometimes under the influence of drugs - as Mr Combs watched and filmed.",
      "He alleged that he witnessed Mr Combs attack Ms Ventura at least twice, including one time when he dragged her by her hair as she screamed \"I'm sorry\".",
      "Mr Combs then came back in the room with Ms Ventura and asked the two to have sex again in front of him, Mr Phillip said.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" he said. \"It came out of nowhere. I was terrified.\"",
      "Mr Phillip claimed on the stand that he did not call the police for fear that Mr Combs was \"someone with unlimited power\" and that he could \"lose his life\" for reporting it.",
      "The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday when Ms Ventura is expected to testify.",
      "At the crowded courthouse on Monday, Mr Combs' children - including his daughters - were seen holding hands. His mother also was photographed walking out of court along with his publicist.",

      "Poland's foreign minister says his country has evidence that Russia recruited people on the Telegram messaging service to carry out last year's massive shopping centre fire in Warsaw.",
      "Speaking to the BBC in an exclusive interview, Radek Sikorski said Moscow's actions were \"completely unacceptable\" and that a second Russian consulate in Poland had been closed as a result.",
      "His comments come after a Polish investigation concluded that the Marywilska shopping centre fire was orchestrated by Moscow's intelligence services.",
      "Russia denied its involvement, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accusing Poland of being \"Russophobic\".",
      "The May 2024 fire destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there belonging to Warsaw's Vietnamese community.",

      "\"It was by miracle that nobody was hurt, but this is completely unacceptable.\"",

      "Responding to the closure of the Krakow consulate, Peskov said: \"All these accusations are absolutely groundless, baseless.",
      "\"There are a lot of different accusations against Russia being voiced in Poland. This part is absolutely Russophobic and unfriendly towards our country.\"",
      "He added: \"As for the reduction of Russia's diplomatic presence in Poland, these are integral parts of a common chain aimed at curtailing the already deplorable state of bilateral relations. Poland chooses hostility and unfriendliness towards us.\"",
      "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services.",
      "Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, meanwhile, told state media: \"Warsaw continues to deliberately destroy relations, acting against the interests of citizens\".",

      "French film star G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was accused by the two women of groping them during work on a film in 2021. Depardieu had denied the allegations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal.",
      "A court in Paris found that one of the women, a set dresser named Am\u00e9lie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time.",
      "She told reporters afterwards she was \"very moved\" and satisfied with the verdict, which for her was \"a victory, a major step forward\".",
      "Depardieu was also convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah, which was not her real name.",
      "The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.",
      "Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer acting for the two women, said she hoped the verdict marked the end of impunity for an artist in the film industry.",
      "\"It's a victory for two women on a film set but it's a victory for all the women behind this case and I'm thinking of all of Depardieu's other victims,\" she told reporters.",
      "The lawyer also noted the case had come to an end hours before the Cannes film festival was due to start.",
      "The judge said there was no reason to doubt the word of the two women victims, who had told the court how Depardieu had touched them on intimate parts of the body, using lewd language.",
      "He placed Depardieu on a list of sex offenders and ordered him to pay compensation of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3840) each to Am\u00e9lie and Sarah for \"secondary victimisation\", a recent innovation covering the additional suffering for the women from the trial itself.",

      "This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.",
      "After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores.",
      "At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: \"It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.",
      "\"You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge G\u00e9rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.\"",
      "Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a \"misogynist\" and a \"case-study in sexism\".",
      "Depardieu's lawyer had demanded an acquittal and called the plaintiffs' team \"more militants than lawyers\".",
      "\"They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,\" he told the court.",
      "The first plaintiff - 54-year-old set decorator Am\u00e9lie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.",
      "The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.",
      "Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.",
      "At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: \"My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.",
      "\"A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.\"",
      "He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. \"These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.",
      "However earlier this month it was reported that he had begun working on a film directed by Fanny Ardant. Depardieu is playing a magician on a mysterious island, according to media reports.",

      "The unusual find was made as workers were clearing the building's basement ahead of its archives being moved to a newly created museum.",
      "The documents were sent by the German embassy in Tokyo and arrived in Argentina on 20 June 1941 inside 83 diplomatic pouches aboard a Japanese steamship, according to information gathered by court officials.",
      "They ended up in the Supreme Court that same year after they were confiscated by Argentine customs officials who had opened five pouches at random and found Nazi propaganda material inside.",
      "They were rediscovered last week by workers who were intrigued by a number of  wooden champagne crates they stumbled upon while moving archival material from the Supreme Court's basement.",
      "\"Upon opening one of the boxes, we identified material intended to consolidate and propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during [World War Two],\" the court said about the find.",

      "However, Argentine custom officials were suspicious because of the size of the shipment and alerted the Argentine foreign minister, fearing it could contain material which could endanger Argentina's neutral stance in World War Two at the time.",
      "Five of the pouches were opened at random and found to contain postcards, photographs and Nazi propaganda material.",
      "The German embassy in Buenos Aires requested that the pouches be sent back to its embassy in Tokyo - from where they had been sent in the first place - but an Argentine judge ordered in September 1941 that all of the 83 pouches be seized.",

    "summary": "The Philippines' mid-term elections saw fewer than expected senators elected from President Marcos' camp.",
    "story": [
      "Dominated by a fiery feud between two political dynasties, the Philippine mid-term elections have thrown up unexpected results that may shake President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr's hold on the senate.",
      "According to the latest count of 80% of the votes, Marcos allies appear to have captured fewer senate seats than expected.",
      "Meanwhile his rival, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who is detained in The Hague over his drug war that killed thousands, has been elected mayor of his family's stronghold.",
      "The fate of his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing an impeachment trial, remains in the balance.",
      "The mid-terms held on Monday saw 18,000 seats contested, from local officials to governors and senators. It served as a proxy war between Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte, who were one-time allies.",
      "The senate race, where 12 seats were up for grabs, was closely watched as it affects Sara Duterte's trial, which she has called \"political persecution\".",
      "The popular vice-president, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028, is facing the prospect of a ban from politics, should a jury made up of senators vote to impeach her.",
      "Many people had expected Marcos Jr's picks to win most of the 12 seats. But according to the latest count of 80% of the votes, only six from his camp appear to have won seats, and one of them has also been endorsed by the Dutertes.",
      "In the top five ranking - a barometer of public popularity - only one Marcos-backed candidate, broadcaster Erwin Tulfo, made it.",
      "Meanwhile, at the very top of the list is a Duterte loyalist - long-time aide Christopher \"Bong\" Go - while at number three is another Duterte ally, former police chief Ronald \"Bato\" dela Rosa.",
      "The Duterte camp appears to have won at least four seats. They include Marcos Jr's older sister Imee, who recently bolted from her brother's alliance to side with the Dutertes.",
      "What complicates things is that it is still unclear how Marcos' allies in the senate will move on Sara Duterte's impeachment. Their loyalty can shift, as senators also balance their own interests and ambitions with their political allegiances.",
      "Meanwhile, two people who are not affiliated with either camp appear to have also won senate seats.",
      "They are Paolo Benigno \"Bam\" Aquino, and an Aquino ally, Francis Pangilinan.",
      "Bam Aquino, the cousin of a former president, has in fact clinched second place in the rankings, in what he called a \"very, very surprising\" result.",
      "It marks the first time in years that voters had chosen outside the Marcos and Duterte dynasties.",
      "The Aquino family was the Marcoses' main political nemesis in the 1980s and early 1990s before the rise of the Dutertes.",
      "It was the assassination of opposition leader Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr in 1983 that galvanised protests against Ferdinand Marcos Sr - the current president's father - culminating in the Marcos family's ouster and exile in 1986.",

      "It was his arrest - approved by Marcos Jr - which pushed the rivalry between his daughter and the current president to boiling point, a few weeks after the president's allies in the House of Representatives voted to impeach Vice-President Duterte.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte was always expected to win as mayor, given the family has held the post since the mid-1980s.",
      "Duterte himself led Davao, a sprawling southern metropolis, for two decades before he was elected president in 2016. There, he showcased his drug war that he credited for the city's success, and won him the support of millions far beyond its borders.",
      "His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor, was elected vice-mayor, meaning he can discharge his father's duties in his absence. Another Duterte son, Paolo, was re-elected as congressman. His grandchildren won local posts.",
      "Duterte's name remained on the ballot as he has not been convicted of any crime. He beat the scion of a smaller rival political family.",
      "Maintaining a political base in Davao city in the south is crucial for the Dutertes - it is where they get the most voter support.",
      "The election was not just a battle between the two families, however.",

    "summary": "Trump says he'd be \"stupid\" to not accept the aircraft \"free of charge\", after Qatar denied it amounted to a gift.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has defended the White House plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar to be used as America's Air Force One presidential plane.",
      "\"They're giving us a gift,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday, adding that he would be \"a stupid person\" if he did not accept it.",
      "In an earlier statement, a Qatari spokesman said it would be \"inaccurate\" to refer to the plane as a gift. He said the transfer of an aircraft for \"temporary use\" was under discussion between the two countries.",
      "The news comes as Trump is set to visit Qatar this week as part of the first major foreign trip of his second term.",
      "Speaking on Monday, Trump said that the US had helped the other country \"a lot over the years in terms of security and safety\" and that he had \"a lot of respect for the leadership\" of the country.",
      "He went on to say it would be a \"very nice gesture\" if Qatar provided the US with a Boeing jet while his government continued to wait for two new ones to be provided directly by Boeing itself.",
      "The potential value of the plane and its handling has raised legal and ethical questions among critics on the political left and right.",
      "The US Constitution has a provision known as the Emoluments Clause, which restricts what gifts US presidents can accept from foreign governments. It was designed to prevent leaders from becoming beholden to foreign governments.",
      "On social media, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff from California quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept \"any present... of any kind whatever\" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.",
      "Congressman Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate, saying the plane could \"constitute the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government\".",
      "But there was criticism, too, from some of Trump's staunchest supporters.",
      "Daily Wire podcaster Ben Shapiro lambasted the plane deal on Monday as \"skeezy\".",
      "\"Is this good for President Trump?\" Shapiro said. \"Is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? The answer is no, it isn't.\"",
      "Far-right influencer Laura Loomer also criticised the move. She posted to say she would \"take a bullet\" for the president, but that any decision to accept the jet would be \"such a stain\" on the administration.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Sunday that \"any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's administration is committed to full transparency\".",
      "The White House's current fleet includes two Boeing 747-200B planes customised for presidential use with special communications equipment and features like a state room, office and conference room. The planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.",
      "Qatar is said to be offering a version of a Boeing 747-8, a much newer model that ABC News reports has been upgraded into a \"flying palace\".",
      "The plane, reported to be worth about $400m (\u00a3303m), would not be ready for use right away if provided to the US, as it would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials, sources told CBS, the BBC's US partner.",
      "Boeing has already been contracted to directly provide the White House with two 747-8s directly, but Trump complained earlier this year that the firm was behind schedule.",
      "His team negotiated to receive these during his first term in office, though Boeing has cautioned that they will not be available for two or three more years.",
      "I'm not happy with Boeing, Trump says over Air Force One",
      "I'm not happy with Boeing, Trump says over Air Force One",
      "Qatar - a country with which Trump has long had a positive relationship - has also previously given private jets as gifts to other countries, including Turkey.",
      "This would not be the first Trump-related deal with Qatar. Last month, his company signed a deal to build a luxury golf resort there, marking its first foreign deal since the Republican returned to office in January.",
      "According to CBS, the plane that Trump could acquire would be donated at the end of his term to his presidential library, which is a collection of artefacts related to a US leader's time in office.",
      "Air Force One planes usually carry over to other administrations. According to the National Archives, only the presidential library for Ronald Reagan has an Air Force One jet.",
      "Trump, a businessman-turned-president, has been no stranger to conflict-of-interest accusations since taking office in 2017. During his first term, critics accused him of enriching himself in a number of ways, including through his hotel in Washington DC. A lawsuit followed, but was never concluded.",
      "Commenting on the potential transfer of the plane, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told the BBC: \"It certainly stinks, but formally it's a transfer to the [US] government, not the office holder.\"",
      "However, the jet could be viewed as an illegal personal gift to Trump if he is able to use it in his private life after leaving office, Prof Super added.",
      "As for who could protest such a move - Congress could pass a resolution denouncing it, said Prof Super, albeit this would be unlikely given the Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, and it would not stop the actual transfer."

      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for.",
      "\"I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way. I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile.\"",
      "India cricket's governing body, the BCCI, praised Kohli for \"redefining the standards of excellence, leadership and commitment in Indian cricket\".",
      "BCCI president Roger Binny added: \"Virat Kohli's name will be remembered alongside the finest ever to have graced Test cricket.",
      "\"What set him apart was not just his hunger for runs, but his commitment to excellence in the toughest format of the game. His leadership marked a shift in how India competed overseas\u2014with aggression, belief and a refusal to settle for second best.",
      "\"He inspired a generation to take pride in the whites, and his impact on Indian cricket will be felt for decades to come.\"",
      "Kohli has long been regarded as one of the four batting greats of his era, alongside England's Joe Root, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, and has scored 30 Test centuries.",
      "Only Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar have scored more Test runs for India than Kohli, while he has the most centuries for an India captain with 20.",
      "But his most recent Test ton, 100 not out in the first Test against Australia in November, was his first in 15 innings across 16 months.",
      "During that series, he scored 190 runs in nine innings averaging just 23.75.",

      "It is hard to overstate Kohli's fame, stardom or influence. He is the biggest presence in the most powerful cricketing nation on the planet. Maybe his name does not travel globally like a Ronaldo or Messi, yet even those two titans will have no idea what it feels like to be Virat Kohli in India.",
      "As a batter, Kohli continued the talismanic lineage of Gavaskar, Azharuddin and Tendulkar. His cover drive is a work of art. In 2018, a Kohli net session in Adelaide went viral, the ball leaving the bat with sound of a pistol being fired. He is the first of the Fab Four to leave Test cricket and while his numbers do not stack up to Smith, Root and Williamson, Kohli is the most pleasing to watch.",
      "As a leader, Kohli dragged the India Test side into the 21st Century. Having more Test wins than any other India captain is statistically significant, though that pales when compared to what Kohli did for his team and Test cricket itself.",
      "It is not an exaggeration to say Kohli was the most important factor in upkeeping the relevance of the longest format when it could otherwise have been completely swallowed by the T20 leagues.",
      "Kohli follows Rohit Sharma into retirement as the regeneration of the India Test team continues. The XI that lines up to face England at Headingley in late June will have an unfamiliar feel. There may be more one-day internationals to savour. In that format, Kohli really is the GOAT.",
      "Even with the histrionics, everything he did was must-see. Without Kohli, Test cricket will be a poorer spectacle.",

      "\"I'm reminded of your thoughtful gesture 12 years ago, during my last Test. You offered to gift me a thread from your late father. It was something too personal for me to accept, but the gesture was heart-warming and has stayed with me ever since. While I may not have a thread to offer in return, please know that you carry my deepest admiration and very best wishes. Your true legacy, Virat, lies in inspiring countless young cricketers to pick up the sport.\" India batting great Sachin Tendulkar",

    "story": [
      "Poland has accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating a massive fire that nearly completely destroyed a shopping centre in the capital Warsaw last year.",
      "In a post on X, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland knows \"for sure\" that the blaze at the Marywilska shopping centre was caused by arson ordered by the Russian special services.",
      "Some of those responsible are already in custody, Tusk added, while all the others alleged to have been involved have been identified and are being searched for.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the allegations, but has previously denied accusations of sabotage in Europe.",
      "The fire in May 2024 destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community.",
      "Poland carried out a year-long investigation into the incident, which has now concluded the fire was organised by an unnamed person in Russia.",
      "A joint statement by Poland's justice and interior ministers said the actions of those in custody were \"organised and directed by a specific person residing in the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The two ministries added that they were co-operating with Lithuania \"where some of the perpetrators also carried out acts of diversion\".",
      "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services.",
      "Polish officials have said that these attacks have been part of a \"hybrid war\" waged by Moscow.",
      "Hybrid warfare is when a hostile state carries out an anonymous, deniable attack, usually in highly suspicious circumstances. It will be enough to harm their opponent, especially their infrastructure assets, but stop short of being an attributable act of war.",
      "Nato also believes Russia is waging \"hybrid warfare\" in Europe, with the aim of punishing or deterring Western nations from continuing their military support for Ukraine.",
      "Russia has denied repeated allegations by Nato countries that its secret services are engaged in sabotage operations across Europe.",
      "Back in March, Lithuanian prosecutors accused Russia's military intelligence service of being behind an arson attack on a branch of Ikea in the capital Vilnius last year.",
      "At the time, Tusk said Lithuania had confirmed Warsaw's \"suspicions that [those] responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services.\"",

      "Three months after the fire, a temporary shopping centre was opened by Marywilska's owners, where approximately 400 traders resumed operations.",
      "An alternative shopping centre in Warsaw, Modlinska 6D, was opened  in October 2024 with traders relocating their businesses to the new site."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygyjy7kz5o",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 01:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "summary": "Severe air pollution is obscuring visibility of the highest mountain peaks on Earth, hitting tourism hard.",
    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

      "For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.",
      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",
      "Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.",
      "The latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.",
      "India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.",
      "Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.",
      "The two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.",
      "While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.",
      "\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.",
      "Islamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.",
      "\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" a  foreign ministry statement said..",
      "Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.",
      "President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.",
      "The main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the \"ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first\".",
      "\"Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,\" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.",
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site\". This has caught the Indians by surprise.",
      "Delhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.",
      "Historically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".",
      "Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "The conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.",
      "But Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.\"",
      "It is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.",
      "The view from Pakistan is different.",
      "\"Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,\" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,\" Mr Gul says.",
      "Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.",
      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.",
      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",
      "Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.",
      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",

      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones Apple iPhones made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",

      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",

      "Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel.",
      "These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.",

      "Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler.",
      "In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\".",
      "As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan.",
      "\"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"",
      "Gil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster.",

      "\"You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.\"",

      "He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm.",
      "The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts.",
      "Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year.",
      "During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order.",
      "Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed.",
      "Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages.",

      "The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.",
      "In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave.",
      "As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.",
      "Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.",
      "Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\"",
      "What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said.",
      "Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked.",
      "\"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying\u2026\" he said.",
      "\"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"",
      "He repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\".",
      "\"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\"",

      "His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened.",

      "He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed.",
      "\"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"",
      "Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander.",
      "He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident.",
      "We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago.",
      "Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself.",

      "Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed.",

    "summary": "Many children in a Brazil town lost the ability to walk, so one scientist set about discovering why.",
    "story": [
      "Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk.",
      "The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome.",
      "Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents.",
      "Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024.",
      "Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics.",
      "\"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.",
      "Serrinha dos Pintos: a world of its own",
      "Where Santos is from in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other.",
      "They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why.",
      "One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirl\u00e2ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks.",
      "Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome.",
      "They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.",
      "At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence.",
      "The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were.",
      "Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable.",
      "Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say.",
      "But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family.",
      "\"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2\u20133%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5\u20136% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.",
      "A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.",
      "Long road to diagnosis",
      "Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region.",
      "She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from S\u00e3o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease.",
      "What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication.",
      "It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland.",
      "Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.",
      "\"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lol\u00f4, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan.",
      "Lol\u00f4, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks.",
      "But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "\"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos.",
      "The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "\"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan.",
      "Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor.",
      "As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers.",
      "This is the case for In\u00e9s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities.",
      "\"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says In\u00e9s, who is married to a second cousin.",
      "Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating.",
      "\"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says.",
      "Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.",
      "The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home.",
      "\"It's as if Santos is family,\" says In\u00e9s."

      "\"We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. I'm very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation,\" she said.",
      "As she prepared for last year's Miss World pageant, she said: \"I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.\"",
      "Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.",
      "It also has a high level of unemployment - 28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.",
      "Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: \"Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.",
      "\"But it's not just the rate of unemployment, it's also just the sphere of youth development.",
      "\"It's lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.\"",
      "Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.",
      "With Botswana's anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs - when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services - were actually reached.",
      "The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.",
      "Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy - something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.",
      "And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.",
      "While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.",
      "Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.",
      "According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.",
      "\"It hurts to know that it could be me next,\" she admitted.",
      "A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create \"peace desks\" at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.",
      "At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.",
      "This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season - this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.",
      "The minister reiterated - on several occasions, including before parliament in March - that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.",
      "But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.",
      "She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.",
      "\"We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age,\" Chombo said.",
      "\"We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.",
      "\"It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.\"",
      "She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs \"to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence\".",
      "\"I hear a lot of people say: 'Why do you speak of women more than men?'",
      "\"It's because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].",
      "\"But when we speak of gender equality, we're saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.\"",
      "Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her - saying that women had to work \"10 times harder\" to succeed.",
      "\"[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that it's not an easy thing.",
      "\"As women, we face so many pressures: 'A woman cannot do this. A woman can't do that.  A woman can't be young and in leadership.' I'm currently facing that.\"",
      "She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: \"She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.",
      "\"She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.\"",
      "Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history - but is also aware that her real work has only just begun.",
      "\"Impact. Tangible impact. That's what success would look like to me,\" she said.",
      "\"I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable. That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 01:05:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Charlie Hopkins was imprisoned in Alcatraz in the 1950s, where he spent three \"lonely\" years.",
    "story": [
      "When Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the \"deathly quiet\" the most.",
      "In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.",
      "Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.",
      "\"That's a lonely sound,\" Hopkins said. \"It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'\"",
      "Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. Another former inmate, William Baker, appeared to be alive as of last year.",
      "In an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape.",
      "Although it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison.",
      "When Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said.",
      "\"There was nothing to do,\" he said. \"You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.\"",
      "Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said.",
      "He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said.",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "At Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.",
      "A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.",
      "Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.",
      "His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.",
      "The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said.",
      "But that did not stop one of the inmates.",
      "In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said.",
      "He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later.",
      "As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said.",
      "\"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said.",
      "All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service.",
      "One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.",
      "A year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation.",
      "Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (\u00a345m) a year in revenue for park partners.",
      "The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.",
      "Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".",
      "Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order, Trump said.",
      "But experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.",
      "Hopkins agrees. \"It would be so expensive,\" he said.",
      "\"Back then, the sewage system went into the ocean,\" he added. \"They'd have to come up with another way of handling that.\"",
      "Hopkins left Alcatraz five years before it closed down for good. He had been transferred to a prison in Springfield, Missouri and given psychiatric medication that improved his behaviour and helped him heal psychological issues, he said.",
      "But the avid Trump supporter said he does not believe the president's proposal is serious.",
      "\"He don't really want to open that place,\" Hopkins said, adding that Trump was trying to \"get a point across to the public\" about punishing criminals and those who enter the US illegally.",
      "Hopkins was released in 1963, working first at a truck stop before taking on other jobs. He went back to his home state of Florida, where now he has a daughter and grandson.",
      "After several decades reflecting on his crimes and life in Alcatraz, he wrote a 1,000-page memoir, with nearly half of the book detailing his troubled behaviour, he said.",
      "\"You wouldn't believe the trouble I caused them when I was there,\" he said. \"I can see now, looking back, that I had problems.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 06:20:59 GMT",
    "summary": "It is a safeguard against unlawful imprisonment - but the White House is \"actively looking\" at pausing it.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a \"privilege\" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants.",
      "Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release.",
      "But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.",
      "What does habeas corpus mean?",
      "Scholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries.",
      "Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means \"you should have the body\" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained.",
      "Also known as the \"Great Writ of Liberty\", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.",
      "Is habeas corpus a right in the US Constitution?",
      "Article One of the US Constitution states that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\".",
      "While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.",
      "Has habeas corpus been suspended before?",
      "Abraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War.",
      "That led to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ.",
      "Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when \"the public safety may require it\".",
      "It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.",
      "After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.",
      "What do modern courts say about habeas corpus?",
      "The courts have found that both US citizens and non-citizens have the right to habeas corpus. In 2008, the US Supreme Court extended this to include non-citizens detained in a foreign prison - such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.",
      "But just because prisoners have the right to challenge their detention, it does not guarantee they will be able to leave custody.",
      "Succeeding with a habeas corpus petition is extremely rare - most people who are detained have been detained for lawful reasons, courts have generally found.",
      "Asadullah Haroon Gul was the first Guantanamo detainee to win a habeas corpus petition in 2021. He was transferred back to Afghanistan more than a decade after the US Supreme Court found that detainees had habeas corpus privileges.",
      "But as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants and student dissenters, habeas corpus has received renewed legal interest.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants being deported under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act must be given enough notice of their removal to file petitions. It temporarily blocked some deportations in Texas for this reason.",
      "Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained after becoming a leading figure in pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed his own habeas corpus petition, as he is in the middle of deportation hearings.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing is not being broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",

      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "She and Combs dated off-and-on from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "Security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 is expected to be a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw Ventura onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Combs denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who have said the women are \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",
      "The highly anticipated trial is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. For the first week, court will be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and 12 jurors were seated\u00a0along with six alternates on Monday, May 12. The selected group included 12 men and six women.",
      "Opening statements immediately followed, and the prosecutors' case against Combs started to take shape.",
      "\"To the public, he was Puff Daddy or Diddy, a cultural icon, a businessman, larger than life. But there was another side to him,\" one prosecutor said.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",
      "Elias E.

      "Sometimes the staff would ask, \"Is it commercial?\" and I would brutalize them, because rather than using their instincts, they were trying to predict the public's appetite, which I said then and say now, over and over again, simply isn't possible. Neither is using research to help make decisions. No amount of research on ideas is worth the paper (or computer screen) it's printed on. Data can tell you what has happened, not what can or will happen.\u00a0Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions. PowerPoint can be the enemy; structured information often narrows the sieve just when you need to broaden it out in the spaces between information and real understanding. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component. That's often the problem with MBA students, who come armed with all the business tools and case studies but little simple human instinct. I do not believe that using instinct rather than deep, hard numerical or fact-based data to help with decision-making is the lazier process. Too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal: Is it a good idea, and does it make any common sense?",
      "You rarely get the perfect project or the perfect script. In all my experience I probably haven't read ten scripts out of a thousand that are so fully realized, so utterly and incontrovertibly great that you just scream, \"Make it!\" One of those, though, was the day in 1970 that Leonard Goldberg, who had recently moved on from ABC to run a large television production company, called up and said, \"You must read this script right now.\" It was called Brian's Song, the story of the deep bond between a Black and a white pro football player, one who will die of cancer. I wept as I read it. I called him up and said, \"We can only screw it up from here\u2014it's perfect\u2014let's go.\" Often referred to as one of the finest television films ever made\u2014and one of the greatest sports films as well\u2014it was nominated for nine Emmys and won five. Another of those few times, Dan Curtis, a leading ABC daytime producer, sent me a manuscript of an as-yet-unpublished novel called The Kolchak Papers. I read it in two or three hours\u2014it was the contemporary tale of a vampire in Las Vegas\u2014and I told Dan, \"This is as good a story as I've ever read.\" And what a great idea: Las Vegas, a city most alive at night\u2014the perfect place for a vampire to live.",
      "Out of that novel we made The Night Stalker, which turned out to be so good that we held a screening for the senior ABC management, who all said, \"That's a great movie. We should release it theatrically!\" I fought against that, saying, \"Yes, it's a great movie, but it's a Movie of the Week, and that's where it belongs.\" We aired the film in early January 1972, and it became ABC's highest-rated Movie of the Week, drawing about 50 million people, a record. The Night Stalker spawned a sequel (The Night Strangler) and a television series (Kolchak: The Night Stalker), and it was followed by two more made-for-TV movies and a subsequent remake of the series. All that from one good idea!",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 10:14:20 -0400",
    "summary": "In his combination business memoir and personal journey, the former media exec opens up about topics he had vowed never to talk about, including his early relations with men, as well as his decades-long relationship with designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, a few steps from Manhattan's Little Island, the people enjoying sunshine on the High Line took little notice of the man who helped create this corner of the world, the legendary businessman Barry Diller.",
      "\"When you're up here, even though you're not up very high, you really are elevated, [with] a totally different perspective of the city,\" Diller said.",
      "Talk about different perspectives: At 83, Diller himself is now inviting people to take another look at him. Next week he'll release his memoir, more than ten years in the making. In \"Who Knew\" he names plenty of names, tells wild stories, and bares his soul about things he says he'd vowed never to talk about in public.",
      "In his preface he writes, \"When I was young, I was far too afraid. I'm no longer that. And I'm too old to care.\"",
      "Afraid of what? \"I was afraid of secrets being revealed,\" he said. \"I was afraid of, I thought I didn't qualify. I think, just afraid of revealing myself.\"",
      "Diller says he was in grade school when he first realized he might be gay. \"Eleven or twelve years old, or 13, I got on my bike, and I rode down to the Beverly Hills Public Library. And I looked for books on homosexuality. And everything I read was, like, horrible. And I got on my bike and I rode home and thought, I'm a condemned person. I mean, for a little kid, that's not great.\"",
      "He had his first sexual encounter at age 16. I asked, \"Did you tell your friends? Did you tell anybody about it?\"",
      "\"Of course not! Are you kidding? I didn't tell myself,\" Diller replied. \"I mean, I thought \u2013 oh, what did I think? I thought, Oh, I did that. I don't have to do it again.\"",
      "\"I did this thing with a guy, but that's the end of it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I don't need to do that again,\" Diller said. \"And then a month later, I did. And then I knew.\"",
      "But at the time, he thought it best to keep it a secret. He vowed never to lie about it, only to keep it quiet. He writes that, through his life, his sexuality was like an \"anvil on a wire\" hanging over his head. \"Yes, because I was afraid,\" he said. \"Listen, this is in the '60s and '70s. Well, I think probably I was being realistic that, first of all, my sexuality was confused. And I thought, Well, if I reveal it, what am I actually gonna reveal?",
      "\"I didn't want to risk what a lot of other people had risked, even at that time. I mean, talking about homosexuality, talking about bi-, whatever sexuality is, was something that scared the hell out of me,\" he said.",
      "In private, Diller lived in fear of being found out, but in public he was one of the gutsiest leaders in the game. As a junior executive at ABC, he pioneered the highly-successful movie of the week, and later created the even-more successful TV miniseries, with landmark events such as \"Roots.\"",
      "When \"Roots\" first aired in 1977, more than half the U.S. population tuned in. \"You really were having 30 to 40 to 50,000,000 people watching at one time, 'cause there was of course no recorder,\" he said. \"It was appointment viewing. And everyone in America came to the appointment.\"",
      "And then, the man who conquered TV went to the movies, becoming, at age 32, head of Paramount.",
      "Did he feel like he belonged? \"Oh my God, no,\" he said. \"When I became chairman of Paramount \u2013 and I was this kid from television, of all things \u2013 it was like, 'How in God's name did that happen? That is an accident of history that will be quickly corrected.'\"",
      "But the kid from TV knew how to tell a good story, and gave the green light to a string of films that have since become classics, like 1977's \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "It was during those early days at Paramount that Diller met fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. Interestingly, they didn't click at first. \"Yeah, the first time I met her, I never wanted to see her again, 'cause she was dismissive of me and whatever,\" he said. \"But then, the second time that we met, which was a few months later, within minutes, it was pure desire.\"",
      "\"It was a steamy romance,\" I said.",
      "\"Yes. Oh, yes, it was those things.\"",
      "\"And you make it clear \u2013 I mean, I'll just put it out there \u2013 your relationship with Diane is not just platonic.\"",
      "\"No. No. It didn't start that, no, no, no, no.\"",
      "\"You're lovers.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"It seems to me like one of the points you're trying to make in the book is that it doesn't have to be a mutually-exclusive thing \u2013 that you can be in love with Diane and, at the same time, be attracted to men?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Diller. \"I don't see anything mutually exclusive with that, no. I mean, other people may, but I don't. If I know that the person cares about me, I'm not jealous of anything else. So, that's just luck, I guess.\"",
      "Diller says he owes much of his professional success to luck as well. And he has had a lot of it: In the '80s, as the chairman of Fox, he created a fourth TV network, Homer Simpson and all.",
      "Asked if he gets bored by success, Diller replied, \"Yes, definitely. I mean, once it's there, what are you going to do with it?\"",
      "In the '90s, Diller switched gears again, investing in home shopping, and eventually scooping up a bunch of internet businesses that became household names, like Expedia and Match.com.",
      "And in-between, he and Furstenberg helped create the High Line, donating their time and tens of millions of dollars. \"It doesn't cure cancer,\" he said. \"It's not going to change the dynamics of the world, eradicate disease, or whatever. But it brings pleasure to people.\"",
      "He says he has a similar goal with this book: to share a good story. And that means telling the truth \u2013 to finally let go of a secret he's been holding onto for a lifetime.",
      "I asked, \"You do touch on these feelings of, Maybe I was wrong?\"",
      "\"I don't know that I was wrong about not talking about my private life; I think I was a coward,\" Diller said. \"And I don't like that. But that is the truth. I was. I did not have \u2013 and I wish I did \u2013 I did not have the courage, at that time, to make declarations.\"",
      "\"Does that weigh on you?\"",
      "\"I wouldn't call it weighing on me,\" he said, \"but it is something that, of course, I've thought \u2026\"\u00a0 He paused. \"But it didn't turn out so terribly.\"",
      "The same might be said of his personal life, too: Diller and von Furstenberg were married in 2001, and they're as strong as ever.",
      "He calls his relationship with her the bedrock of his life. \"Well, I don't know any better description than bedrock,\" Diller said. \"The best times for us are when it's just us. And after almost 50 years, how lucky do you get?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 09:39:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated actress talks about playing the activist whose 1990s lawsuit demanding equal pay with her male colleagues went all the way to the Supreme Court, and how her own mother inspired her performance.",
    "story": [
      "If you don't know the name Lilly Ledbetter, how's this for an introduction? \"Lilly Ledbetter did not set out to be a trailblazer or a household name,\" said President Obama in 2009. \"She was a good hard worker who did her job, and she did it well for nearly two decades before discovering that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work.\" Forty percent less, by most accounts.",
      "Now, a new film, \"Lilly,\" starring Patricia Clarkson, chronicles Ledbetter's David-and-Goliath-type fight for equal pay against her employer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, in Alabama.",
      "Asked what she knew about Ledbetter before reading the script, Clarkson replied, \"Well, that she was one of the most remarkable human beings ever put on this Earth, a true, true American hero. A grave injustice had been committed against her. But she was also dealing with misogyny, ageism. But yet, she was this amazing manager. She rose.\"",
      "A female manager at a tire factory in the 1970s was almost unheard of. But Ledbetter needed the money to help her husband support their two kids. In 1998, she found a list of names and salaries of her male counterparts, all of whom made far more than she did.",
      "As the movie depicts, Ledbetter found an anonymous note, left for her in her locker, that detailed the pay discrepancies. \"And she was devastated,\" said her daughter, Vickie Ledbetter Saxon. \"She told me she didn't know how she was going to get through the shift. She was humiliated.\"",
      "Ledbetter filed suit, and was awarded $3.8 million in back pay and damages. But a court of appeals overturned the verdict. She never saw a dime.",
      "Her case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where a 5-4 ruling in favor of Goodyear stated that she had waited too long to file a discrimination claim (the statute of limitations was just 180 days).",
      "\"She was extremely devastated by that,\" said Saxon. \"And I thought it was over, I really did.\"",
      "It wasn't. By then, Ledbetter was nearly 70, and became a symbol of unequal treatment in the workplace. She made it her life's mission to correct pay disparity, and she maintained her activism well into her 80s.",
      "In a speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Ledbetter said, \"Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental American principle.\"",
      "On January 29, 2009, President Obama signed his first piece of legislation: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which effectively ended the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims.",
      "Clarkson said, \"People care about her journey. It's like: I get you. I know who the hell you are. I know what you went through. I've been through it, too. And whether you're a man or a woman or you're Black or White or young or old, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, whether you were gay or straight, everybody struggles in this way.\"",
      "Clarkson has played a string of memorable characters, from a heroin addict in \"High Art,\" to the mom in \"Easy A.\" She says Hollywood is no exception.",
      "Asked if she believes she was paid equally throughout her career, Clarkson replied, \"Oh, no. Oh, no. No. When I was first working, I was paid scale, which is just the barest of minimum. Young men in the movie with me who had the same amount of words or scenes that I had were making a salary. But I was being paid scale. I didn't know that I was making way less to the dollar. But not anymore, baby!\"",
      "Clarkson says to become Lilly, she spent time in a New York City park: \"Every time I went somewhere, or I just would walk around the street, I was like, 'That's Lilly, that's Lilly, that's Lilly.' I mean, everybody, she's everywhere.\"",
      "She especially found Lilly in her own mother, Jackie Clarkson, a New Orleans City Councilwoman and Louisiana state representative. \"What I brought forth was the best of me, my mother, to play Lilly, because I had this shining example,\" she said. \"It's very hard for me to watch 'Lilly.' My mother is there. My mother is a very kindred spirit with Lilly.\"",
      "When she got the part, her mom was her first call. \"You know, 'cause I've played a lot of complicated women, and she was like, 'Oh, Patty. Oh, Patty. This is so glorious. This is wonderful. You're finally gonna be in a movie everybody can see!'\"",
      "Clarkson says playing Ledbetter is the privilege of her life.",
      "Asked what she learned about herself by playing Lilly, Clarkson said, \"I need to always strive to care more, to be better, to try to be a better human being, to be a better citizen.\"",
      "I said, \"I think an experience that one has watching this film and seeing her story is to think, 'Would I rise to the occasion over and over? If I were called upon, would I be that brave?'\"",
      "\"I don't know that I would,\" said Clarkson. \"If I had lost the settlement, I would have been like, 'I'm done.'\"",
      "Both Jackie Clarkson and Ledbetter died last year. Lilly Ledbetter screened the film just days before her death, before Clarkson could meet her.",
      "Asked what she would say to Ledbetter if she could, Clarkson replied, \"You lived an exceptional life with very little. And that people can be exceptional with very little. My mother was, too. They're gonna be dancing. Happy Mother's Day, Lilly, Mom!\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's ever-changing tariffs have caused some\u00a0confusion for Americans, as higher prices and expectations of empty store shelves threaten to change the ways consumers stock up on essentials.",
      "Assuaging concerns among consumers and on Wall Street\u00a0\u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 a U.S. agreement with China,\u00a0announced on Monday\u00a0by the White House, would effectively reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "President Trump also recently announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

    "summary": "A House Republican bill would require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or be enrolled in school for at least 80 hours a month.",
    "story": [
      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "There are exceptions for the work requirement, however. The bill states that people who are under 19 years old as well as women who are pregnant or who are under postpartum medical care are among those who can receive a waiver.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

      "In February, President Trump moved to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption by imposing a 120% tax, or a flat fee of $100 on packages. When the exemption was eliminated on May 2, tariffs of up to 145% became applicable to packages from China worth $800 or less.",
      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order stated.",

American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",

      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",

As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",

      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",

      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-april-2025-inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 10:31:45 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-china-trump-trade/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 10:17:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rent-apartments-zillow-homes/",
    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 17:07:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the pandemic, the monthly rent for a typical apartment around the U.S. has surged almost 30% to $1,858, Zillow data shows.",
    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",
      "\"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "As a Biden administration ban on so-called \"junk fees\" took effect Monday, Ticketmaster said it will start displaying the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping.",
      "Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC's action.",
      "\"Ticketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing to become the nationwide standard so fans can easily compare prices across all ticketing sites,\" Ticketmaster Chief Operating Officer Michael Wichser said in a statement.",
      "Additional improvements",
      "Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added.",
      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world's largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping.",
      "Cracking down on bots",
      "The company also says it plans to step up its fight against\u00a0ticket bots, or automated software used by resellers to bulk-buy mass quantities of tickets. Complaints about these systems came to a head during the November 2022 presale to\u00a0Taylor Swift's Eras tour, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift's upcoming stadium tour.",
      "The company at the time said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "\"We now block an average of 200 million bot attempts every day, stopping them from stealing tickets meant for real fans,\" Ticketmaster said in a statement. \"In 2024 alone, we blocked over 53 billion bot attacks, a more than 5x increase from 2019.\"",
      "Monopoly trial",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",
      "President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \"commonsense\" changes to the way live events are priced.",
      "Under the order, the FTC must ensure \"price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process\" and take enforcement to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct.",
      "\"Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years \u2014 no matter what your politics are \u2014 knows that it's a conundrum,\" said Kid Rock, who joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump signed the order.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 14:14:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The White House says the U.S. and China have agreed to suspend for 90 days most of the tariffs imposed against each other over the last couple months.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",
      "UBS Global Wealth Management projects the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports will ultimately settle around 30% to 40%.",
      "Even with the contours of a U.S-China deal potentially in place, Americans today face an overall effective tariff rate of 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab.",

    "summary": "President Trump's sudden and unpredictable tariffs have caused tremendous concerns among small business owners, whose livelihoods are now in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "Beth Benike is a mom, a veteran, and a small business owner \u2013 and she's sounding the alarm. \"I've been telling all of my friends and family that anything you want for Christmas, to get it right now, especially if you're buying for children. If you are buying any baby products at all, get them while they're here, because they're gonna be gone.\"",
      "After a decade serving in the Army, stationed in Bosnia, Kuwait, Iraq and beyond, Benike started Busy Baby, a Minnesota company that designs and sells placemats and utensils for babies and toddlers. All her products are made in China. And now, those products are subject to President Trump's 145% tax on Chinese imports.",
      "\"We have three months' worth of products sitting at the factory,\" Benike said. \"And now, in order to get it here, we need $230,000 on top of what we've already paid for the product, just to get it in the country.\"",
      "\"Can you afford that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" Benike replied.",
      "\"So, what do you do?\"",
      "\"First, I sat on my kitchen floor and cried,\" Benike said. \"And when I was on the floor in the kitchen, my son came in to show me something or tell me something, and he saw me sitting there, crying. My eight-year-old son. \u2026 And he put his arms around me and just hugged me. And, like, I realized I'm not gonna let him see this. This is not what we're gonna be.\"",
      "The tariffs hit just after Benike struck a deal to sell Busy Baby products at Target and Walmart. To produce enough inventory, she took out a loan from the Small Business Administration. \"That loan is partially SBA-financed, and then partially leveraged against my house,\" Benike said. \"So, if I can't stay in business and pay those loans, I lose the house.\"",
      "Inside Benike's warehouse, this is what's left:",
      "Once this inventory is sold, Benike said, \"then we're out of product. Then we're sold out. We've got nothing more coming in.\"",
      "One of the retailers Benike supplies is Little Roo's, in Chaska, Minnesota. Owner Marissa Held-Nordling says she has seen shopper behavior change since tariffs were introduced. For the first time ever, she is allowing customers to stockpile baby registry gifts, like Benike's Busy Baby mats. That way, family and friends can still get what they need, often for baby showers months away.",
      "\"You can't just do a registry anymore, because the products aren't guaranteed that it's still going to be on the shelf,\" said Held-Nordling. \"So, at this point I'm allowing people to come in and fill a bin, and they can get their exact colors \u2026 and then I close the bin and I take this product off my website.\"",
      "While the U.S. and China begin trade talks, economists still expect most goods to get more expensive \u2013 or even go out of stock, from clothing to electronics to toys. Yale's Budget Lab says tariffs could add nearly $5,000 a year to families' household expenses.",

      "Trump says there are no tariff exceptions in his trade war, despite electronics exemptions",
      "Kyla Scanlon, an economic analyst and author of \"In This Economy? How Money & Markets Really Work,\" said, \"It's probably a smart time to take advantage of this weird, uncertain moment to make sure that you have what you need, just in case prices do get more expensive. If you don't need something right away, a lot of financial advisors would recommend that you do start padding your emergency fund, and putting some money to the side.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are these tariffs necessary to rebalance the global economy?\"",
      "\"I don't think this was necessary,\" Scanlon laughed. \"Targeted tariffs are okay. But when you do broad, blanket tariffs on everything, and when the rate is confusing, when small businesses don't know how to invest, they don't know what they should be spending money on \u2013 it's just not a good economic environment.\"",
      "The legality of the Trump administration sidestepping Congress to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. President Trump says he imposed these tariffs in part to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "When asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" if there were discussions about giving relief to small businesses, Trump replied, \"They're not going to need it. They're gonna make so much money, if you build your product here.\"",
      "But Benike says that's impossible \u2013 that manufacturing her products in the U.S. is too expensive: \"The cost of land is higher here. The cost of insurance, the building, electricity, employees. And these factories that are producing now in the U.S., the raw materials they're bringing in are being tariffed as well.\"",
      "It's an untenable situation, even for someone as successful as Benike. Just last week, she was recognized for her company's success \u2013 while she worried about its survival.",
      "\"I was in D.C. to receive my Small Business Person of the Year Award at the fanciest hotel in D.C., with my son in his adorable little suit and bow tie,\" she said. \"And I just sat there feeling defeated. Where I would've loved to have celebrated that, now I have to prove it.\"",
      "Still, she's not giving up. She's drawing inspiration from a phrase she picked up in the military: Improvise, adapt and overcome.",
      "\"So, Plan B is figuring out how to become a global brand,\" she said.",
      "\"And not sell in the United States?\" I asked.",
      "\"For now,\" Benike said, adding, \"It'll come back some day.\"",
      "\"You have faith?\"",
      "\"I do. I have faith. It'll come back some day. This can't possibly last forever.\"",

A spokesperson for the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S. suggested in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday that the U.S. was the one to reach out and initiate talks.",

      "The CPSC is an independent agency that regulates the safety of consumer products, from toys to appliances. It's the group that often handles recalls of items such as kitchen ranges that can set fires and steam cleaners that have burned users.",
      "In his statement, Trumka said he was given no reason for his firing, but that his dismissal came after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to work at the agency. Trumka, who was appointed to a 7-year term by President Biden in 2021, said he pushed back against DOGE because \"if these people are allowed in to govern our agency, they will gut it and the result will turn back the clock on product safety.\"",
      "He added, \"CPSC's livesaving work is far too important to take this lying down.\"",
      "In addition to Trumka, two other commissioners on the five-person Consumer Product Safety Commission were fired on Thursday,\u00a0according to the Washington Post. All three were Democrats, the publication said.",
      "Trumka expounded on the firings in an interview Friday with CBS News.",
      "\"On Wednesday, we had a public commission meeting, where we said there's no financial reason, no logical reason, to get rid of anyone at our agency, because their lifesaving work is to important to compromise,\" Trumka told CBS News. \"And just the next day, DOGE was in our building. They asked if we would allow them to implant at  our agency. They asked for our answer to that by 6 p.m. We said 'no.' And moments later, we were fired by email from the president.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, however, in a press briefing Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the CPSC falls under the executive branch, giving the president the right to fire employees there.",
      "Consumer Reports issued a statement condemning the CPSC firings, and said that the commissioners should be reinstated immediately.",
      "\"This is an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country's product safety watchdog,\" said William Wallace, director of safety advocacy for Consumer Reports, in an email. \"Anyone who cares about keeping their family safe should oppose this move and demand that it be reversed.\"",
      "Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and three other Democratic senators \u2014 Maria Cantwell of Washington; Ed Markey of Massachusetts; and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut \u2014 also objected to the firings in a May 9 letter to Mr. Trump, calling the dismissals \"illegal.\"",
      "\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure toys are safe for our kids and the products Americans use everyday don't have hidden hazards,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"It conducts thousands of investigations and issues crucial recalls .... This move is dangerous and illegal.\"",
      "DOGE firings",
      "DOGE has sought to cut federal workers in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But many of its firings have had to be reversed, either because the group mistakenly fired essential workers \u2014 like bird-flu experts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 or after a court ruled the dismissals were illegal.",
      "DOGE's savings have largely been wiped out\u00a0by costs related to those issues as well as lost productivity, according to a recent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",

      "Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged in April, as steep tariffs on China make it too costly for many U.S.-based retailers to import goods from the country.",
      "President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with Beijing in April, hiking tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145%. China retaliated with 125% levies on Americans goods.",
      "As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier, data released Friday from China's General Administration of Customs shows. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social that the levies on China could come down to 80%.\u00a0The lower rate \"seems right,\"\u00a0wrote the president, ahead of U.S.-China\u00a0trade negotiations set to kick off this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses. Many consumers, meanwhile, are unlikely to afford price hikes from steep tariffs at a time when they are already squeezed financially.",
      "Upending trade patterns",
      "Some business owners say they are skipping orders they would normally have already placed with Chinese factories, as they wait and see where tariff rates on China and other countries settle.",
      "Mr. Trump in April announced a bevy of country-specific tariffs, which he later placed on hold \u2014 with the exception of those on China \u2014 for\u00a090 days. A 10% tariff in place on all imports to the U.S. remains in effect. Businesses say the 10% baseline tax is a challenge, but far easier to absorb than duties over 100%.",
      "April's shakeup in the flow of goods around the world comes as many retailers rethink their supply chains, and some take steps to reduce their reliance on China, with steep levies in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese imports from the U.S. dropped more than 13% compared with April 2024. Beijing could bring down its 125% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, if trade negotiations between the two countries progress this weekend.",

    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

    "story": [
      "Steep new U.S. tariffs on imports are rattling businesses large and small, with many companies planning to absorb the higher costs by hiking prices for customers. Not footwear company Keen.",
      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

      "News of a potential deal inflated investor confidence Thursday, with markets making gains in early trading. Following the trade deal announcement, the S&P 500 soared 55 points, or 1%, to 5,686 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408 points, or 1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3%.",
      "More trade deals are also in the works, according to President Trump.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation. Mr. Trump imposed levies of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods.",
      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",

      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",

      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

      "Xinis has set a hearing for May 16 to hear further arguments about the government's privilege invocations, as well as to hear arguments from Abrego Garcia's attorneys on their desire for more fact-finding in the case.",
      "Xinis told a Justice Department attorney during a hearing last month that if the Trump administration does assert privileges, justifications must be provided for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, under war powers",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote that all depositions were completed by the end of last week, but said they are not satisfied with the answers they have received.",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants, mostly Venezuelans, sent by the Trump administration to CECOT in March.",
      "\"The Court should reject the Government's efforts to hide behind the state secrets privilege and compel all Defendants from DHS and DOJ to fully respond to written discovery and all deponents from those departments to fully answer deposition questions,\" the attorneys wrote to Judge Xinis, adding later that \"the state secrets privilege is not for hiding governmental blunders or malfeasance.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that he intends to place holds on President Trump's political nominees to the Justice Department in response to a Qatari-offered jet for the president's use, while calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.",
      "\"In light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the attorney general personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees until we get more answers,\" Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.",
      "Mr. Trump is making his first international trip of his second term this week, where he arrived in Saudi Arabia Tuesday before visiting Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the coming days. Meanwhile, an unprecedented offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate a jumbo jet for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane has sent shockwaves through the political sphere back home.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the possible gift \"so corrupt\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"would give a double take,\" while calling it a \"grave national security threat.\"",
      "The minority leader outlined a number of requests of the Justice Department, calling on its Foreign Agent Registration Act unit to disclose all activities by Qatari foreign agents inside the U.S. that could benefit Mr. Trump or his family's organization, while urging that the American people \"deserve to know the facts.\"",
      "Schumer asked who would install security measures on the jet, how the measures would be verified, what modifications would be needed to ensure its safety, along with who would pay for the installations and how much would they cost. He also asked what Qatar is being offered in return, while calling on the attorney general to testify before the House and Senate to explain why the gift does not violate any ethics law or the emoluments clause, which prohibits government officials from accepting compensation from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.",
      "\"Until the attorney general explains her blatantly inept decision, and we get answers to these questions, I will place a hold on all political nominees to the Department of Justice,\" Schumer said.",
      "The practical impact of the holds remains unclear. The holds would be expected to slow the nominations by requiring Senate Republicans to take each procedural vote rather than moving forward with the nominees under an expedited timeframe. And Justice Department nominees aren't voted on en bloc like military promotions, further delaying the process.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the Qatari government had \"graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,\" while noting that the details were still being worked out. And the president defended accepting the gift of the plane Monday, saying \"I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\" He added that it would \"go directly\" to his presidential library when he leaves office.",
      "But Democrats have vehemently denounced the offer, while a number of Republicans have called the ethics and national security implications of the potential gift into question.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who was asked whether Mr. Trump should reject the Qatari jet, told reporters Tuesday that he didn't know whether there had been an official offer yet. But he added that he thinks there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be further discussed.",

      "The Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Agriculture committees are scheduled to meet Tuesday on their proposals that include changes to Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts. But major divisions among Republicans remain on several issues, including how to overhaul Medicaid and a tax deduction expiring in December.",
      "Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee, who were responsible for finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts, released the long-awaited details of their plan Sunday. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that achieving those savings would not be possible without cuts to Medicaid. Democrats have hammered Republicans on the issue, while Republicans have vowed to protect the benefits of eligible recipients.",
      "The changes to Medicaid laid out in the legislation include imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children.",
      "The committee did not lower the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention between moderates and conservatives. In recent weeks, Republicans had considered moving more of the cost sharing to the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "The exclusion is sure to rankle more conservative members who have demanded steep cuts to Medicaid spending, especially for those covered by the expansion. Republican Rep.

    "story": [
      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't expect to be reckoning with another health care crisis.",
      "In March, as President Trump and congressional Republicans escalated a nationwide debate over whether to slash health care for poor and disabled Americans, the Democratic governor had to tell state lawmakers that California's health care costs had spiraled out of control due to major Medicaid initiatives he backed \u2014 including the nation's largest expansion of taxpayer-financed health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "His top officials at the state Department of Finance quietly disclosed to California lawmakers in a letter that the state had borrowed $3.4 billion to pay health insurers, doctors, and hospitals caring for patients enrolled in California's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Facing rising health care costs amid a deepening state budget crisis, Newsom now must contemplate rolling back coverage and benefits.",
      "The second-term governor faces a tough political decision: renege on his promise to achieve universal health care and strip coverage from millions of immigrants who lack legal status or look elsewhere for budget cuts. With nearly 15 million low-income or disabled residents enrolled in Medi-Cal, California has more to lose on health care than any other state. Yet even as Newsom has condemned Mr. Trump's approach to tariffs and environmental policies, he has been tight-lipped on health policy.",
      "Complicating his political tightrope: Polling shows that providing health care coverage for immigrants without legal status has tepid support. And any resulting budget trouble could harm his political legacy should he run for president in 2028.",
      "\"We all know that the cuts are definitely coming,\" said Carlos Alarcon, a health and public benefits analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, which has helped spearhead a decadelong campaign in California to expand Medicaid to eligible immigrants without legal status. \"The governor should keep his commitment \u2014 we'll be very disappointed if we see cuts and rollbacks. When times get hard, it's always our marginalized and underserved communities that lose out.\"",
      "California allows any low-income adults to enroll in Medi-Cal if they earn 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 a year or less, regardless of immigration status. But the costs have been dramatically higher than expected.",
      "Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown first expanded Medi-Cal to people age 19 and younger without legal status, but he expressed reluctance to go further because of potential costs. Newsom signed bills into law adding people age 20 and older. An estimated 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are now covered, and costs have soared to $9.5 billion per year, up from $6.4 billion estimated in November. The federal government chips in roughly $1.1 billion of that total for pregnancy and emergency care.",
      "\"We can expand out of the graciousness of our heart to everywhere and anywhere, but the moment these resources run out, now everybody loses. We're hitting that breaking point,\" said California Assembly member David Tangipa (R-Fresno). \"Either we get fiscally responsible, or there's not going to be services for anybody \u2014 and that includes the Californian and the undocumented immigrant.\"",
      "Democratic leaders responsible for approving the state budget declined interviews. In a statement, state Sen. Mar\u00eda Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), who championed the expansion in the legislature, said, \"Rolling back this progress would be a harmful and shortsighted decision.\"",
      "Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment for immigrants without legal status, imposing cost-sharing measures such as drug copays or premiums, or restricting benefits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified to protect relationships at the state Capitol.",
      "However, it's unlikely Newsom will slash funding in his budget revision set for release on May 14. Instead, cuts would follow if congressional Republicans approve a budget deal with major reductions in federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"This is going to be very problematic for the governor. Budget cuts will disrupt the lives of millions of immigrants who just got health care, but the governor has got to do something, because this is not sustainable,\" said Mark Peterson, an expert on health care and national politics at UCLA. \"The prospect of cutting other places in order to support immigrants living in the country illegally would be a hard political sale; I don't see that happening.\"",
      "Should Newsom, along with the Democratic-controlled legislature, be forced to make cuts, he could argue he had no choice. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have threatened states like California with the latest U.S. House proposal cutting Medicaid funding by 10 percentage points for states that provide coverage for immigrants without legal status. For Newsom, political analysts say, Mr. Trump could make an easy scapegoat.",
      "\"He can blame Trump \u2014 there's only so much money to go around,\" said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican political analyst in California who specializes in Latino issues. \"It's making people look at the health care that they can't afford and ask, 'Why the hell are we giving it for free to people who are here illegally?'\"",
      "The exorbitant cost has come as somewhat of a surprise.",
      "In Newsom's first budget proposal as governor \u2014 in which he called for expanding Medi-Cal to young adults without legal status \u2014 his administration estimated it would cost roughly $2.4 billion annually to extend benefits to all eligible people regardless of status. But the latest figure reported to legislators was nearly four times as much.",
      "Newsom declined to respond to questions from KFF Health News, instead referencing previous comments that leave the door open to scaling back Medi-Cal. The governor noted \"sober\" discussions with lawmakers and said cutting Medi-Cal is \"an open-ended question\" that the president will heavily influence.",
      "\"What's the impact of Donald Trump on a lot of these things? What's the impact of federal vandalism to a lot of these programs?\" Newsom asked rhetorically in December, suggesting it's unclear whether he'll be able to sustain the expansion to immigrants without legal status in future years.",
      "Newsom expanded Medi-Cal in three phases, starting with immigrants ages 19 to 25, who became eligible in 2020, resisting pressure from health care advocates for one big, costly expansion. He argued doing it incrementally would ultimately save California money.",
      "\"It is the right thing morally and ethically,\" Newsom said in 2020. \"It is also the financially responsible thing to do.\"",
      "Record budget surpluses in recent years allowed Democrats to continue. Older adults ages 50 to 64 became eligible in 2022, and Newsom closed the gap the following year, approving coverage starting in 2024 for the biggest group, those ages 26 to 49.",
      "But the costs have grown tremendously while the budget picture has soured, according to a KFF analysis of the most recent 2023 records available from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal.",
      "Aside from children, it was more expensive to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants without legal status than to legal residents. For instance, Medi-Cal paid L.A. Care, a major health insurer in Los Angeles, an average of $495.32 monthly to provide care for a childless adult without legal status and $266.77 for a legal resident without kids.",
      "Not only were immigrants without legal status more expensive, California footed most of the cost. The state paid roughly between 60% and 70% of health care costs for a childless adult immigrant covered by L.A. Care, and about 10% for a legal resident without kids. Those costs don't encapsulate the entire cost of providing care, which can vary depending on where Medi-Cal patients live, and grow higher when filling prescriptions, going to the dentist, or seeking mental health care.",
      "These payments also differ by insurer, but the trend holds across the state's Medi-Cal health insurance plans. Patients in most of the state can choose from more than one health plan.",
      "Children without legal status in many cases were cheaper to cover than children who were legal residents. Generally, kids are healthier and require less care.",
      "Mike Genest, who served as finance director under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, argued that the state should have planned for the immense price tag.",
      "\"The idea that we'd be able to afford in the long run paying for health care for all these undocumented people \u2014 it's beyond unsustainable,\" Genest said.",
      "While costs are high now, the expansion of Medi-Cal will result in long-term savings to taxpayers and the health care system, said Anthony Wright, who previously lobbied for the expansion as the head of the nonprofit Health Access and is now fighting Medicaid cuts as the executive director of Families USA, based in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"They're going to be showing up in our health care system regardless,\" Wright said. \"Leaving them without health insurance is just going to end in more crowded emergency rooms, and it's going to cost even more. It doesn't make any sense economically for them to be uninsured; that takes critical revenue from clinics and hospitals, just causing more problems.\"",

      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, was taken into ICE custody earlier this month after a May 5 traffic stop in Dalton, where she lives with her family. Local police cited her for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers.",
      "But the Dalton Police Department and the city's prosecutor announced on Monday they had reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Officials said the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving.",
      "Arias Cristobal is now facing deportation and remains detained at the Stewart ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, according to the agency's online system for tracking detainees. Her father, Jose Francisco Arias Tovar, is also being held there. ICE arrested him last month, also following a traffic stop, his family said.",

      "In a statement before Monday's announcement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Arias Cristobal an \"illegal alien\" who had \"admitted to illegally entering the United States.\" McLaughlin said Arias Cristobal's father, Arias Tovar, \"self-admitted that he is in the country illegally.\"",
      "Federal officials have not disputed that Arias Cristobal and her father lack criminal records.",
      "\"[The] family will be able to return to Mexico together,\" McLaughlin said in her statement. \"Mr. Tovar had ample opportunity to seek a legal pathway to citizenship. He chose not to. We are not ignoring the rule of law.\"",

He said local officials notified her lawyers of the dismissed charges but did not alert ICE.",

Free alleges that during February's election, the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together. In doing so, Free argues, the DNC used procedures that gave male candidates an advantage over female candidates, violating the party's charter.",

Representatives for Hogg and Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state lawmaker, argued it's up to the DNC chair to interpret whether voting procedures are consistent with the rules.

      "What is bitcoin mining \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors \u2014 known as miners \u2014 who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.",
      "The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor.",
      "But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine.

    "summary": "The Trump administration has offered refugee status to dozens of Afrikaners from South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "A plane carrying dozens of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport on Monday, a State Department official said, after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States.",
      "The group \u2014 which includes families with children \u2014 was greeted at the D.C.-area airport by U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar. Landau told reporters the group has faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa \u2014 which the country's government has denied.",
      "Landau said the new arrivals were \"carefully vetted\" in South Africa prior to their arrival. They departed\u00a0Johannesburg via a charter plane on Sunday.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent \u2014 particularly Afrikaners, who are largely descended from Dutch settlers \u2014 to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program.",
      "The administration and its allies, including South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, allege members of South Africa's White minority have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government, including through a controversial law that allows the government to take private land in some circumstances.",
      "\"South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social in February.",
      "The South African government has strongly denied any discrimination, and argues the land seizure law respects private property rights and only targets land that isn't used or doesn't serve the public interest. Land ownership has long been a sensitive issue in South Africa, which was ruled by its White minority under the apartheid system until the mid-1990s.",
      "\"It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the U.S. from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,\" South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation said in a February statement.",
      "Landau also cited attacks on South African farmers in recent years, saying the new arrivals have faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government argues attacks in the country's rural farming communities are not racially targeted and are part of South Africa's broader crime problem.",
      "The Trump administration has also clashed with the South African government over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa.",
      "The South Africans moved through the refugee process at an unusually fast clip, arriving in the United States after a few months, even though the process frequently takes years.",
      "They also arrived in the United States despite a broader effort by the Trump administration to suspend the refugee admission program \u2014 a move that has drawn court challenges.",
      "Refugee group declines to help resettle South Africans",
      "The federal government typically relies on nonprofits to help resettle refugees in the United States, but at least one group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, said Monday it will not assist with the South African arrivals.",
      "Episcopal Bishop Sean Rowe said the government informed the group \u2014 which receives federal grants \u2014 that it would be expected to assist the South Africans. The group opted against assisting and will instead wind down its work with the government, he said, citing the group's \"steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation.\"",
      "\"It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,\" Rowe said in a statement.",
      "Some other refugee resettlement groups have indicated they are willing to work with the South Africans.",
      "Church World Service CEO Rick Santos criticized the government for restricting most other refugee admissions, but said the group \"remains committed to serving all eligible refugee populations seeking safety in the United States, including Afrikaners who are eligible for services,\" in a statement to the Associated Press.",

      "The entry of Feenstra, who has represented Iowa's 4th Congressional District since 2021, could set up a possible high-profile Republican primary that may come to include Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird\u2014widely regarded within GOP circles as President Trump's preferred choice, if she decides to jump into the fray.",
      "Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand entered the race for governor Monday morning. A Democrat has not won the Iowa governor's office since 2006, giving the left long odds at being able to break the GOP's widening winning streak in the politically important Midwestern state.",
      "Feenstra's campaign and Sand's bid mark the first major moves towards the office on both sides and in turn make them the leading candidates in their respective party primaries at this early point.",
      "Other potential GOP candidates are Mike Bousselot, a state senator; Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig; state representative Bobby Kaufmann; and Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley.",
      "The Iowa race could be one of the most closely watched gubernatorial races in the state and nationally next year. Iowa is a training ground for operatives and presidential hopefuls looking to 2028. Unlike many other states, governors in Iowa are not term-limited which can restrict the ability of ambitious candidates to try to win an open seat statewide. That means next year will offer a relatively\u00a0 rare opportunity for Iowa politicians.",

    "summary": "The White House says the U.S. and China have agreed to suspend for 90 days most of the tariffs imposed against each other over the last couple months.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",

      "Eva Steege may have seemed like an unlikely combattant in the pushback against mass firings by the Trump administration. The 83-year-old retired Lutheran pastor was in hospice, unable to walk, when she was asked to join a group seeking to block the administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "\"It took us about five minutes to decide that that was a good thing to do,\" her husband Ted Steege, 82, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "When Eva died in March, Ted took her place in the lawsuit which, to this point, has prevented the agency's dismantling and yielded hundreds of pages of internal communications shedding new light on DOGE's effort to slash the federal workforce. Steege has become one face of the human toll wrought by the chaos and scope of the mass federal firings that marked the Trump administration's first 100 days in Washington.",
      "\"We saw an opportunity, not just to gain something that we were entitled to, but also to do something that will change lives for lots of dedicated workers and for people all around the country who have suffered injustices, quiet things that nobody ever notices,\" Ted Steege said.",
      "The injustice the couple faced originated with Eva's decision in her 60s to fulfill a lifelong dream of becoming a pastor. To afford her seminary school tuition, Steege said the couple sold their house and took on $43,000 in debt.",
      "For years, they dutifully paid down the debt but, as of January, still believed they owed about $17,000. On the advice of Lutheran Social Services, the couple approached the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for help enrolling in a federal loan forgiveness program.",
      "Established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the bureau, known as the CFPB, is tasked with protecting consumers from financial fraud and shady lending practices. Workers reviewing the Steeges' case discovered the Steeges didn't need loan forgiveness at all \u2014 that in fact they had overpaid and were owed more than $15,000 in refunds.",
      "Filled with hope, the couple planned on meeting with CFPB staffers on Feb. 10. That morning the Trump administration issued a stop work order effectively shutting down the agency.",
      "\"An email came that said, sorry we have different directives,\" Steege said. \"We can't meet with you.\"",
      "A grieving husband joins the court battle over DOGE firings",
      "Now, he's fighting to restore the bureau's functions by staving off the mass firing of its employees. The battle is playing out in federal court, where earlier this month appellate judges issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's latest effort to slash the workforce.",
      "The ruling came after a flurry of filings in the case made public a trove of emails, internal chats and sworn employee declarations. The documents revealed a frantic push in April by agency leadership and DOGE officials to fire nearly 1,500 employees \u2014 about 90% of the CFPB's staff.",
      "Helping to carry out the mass dismissals was a 25-year-old DOGE official named Gavin Kliger, who has helped implement cuts across at least half a dozen federal agencies. Kliger has no federal government experience prior to working for DOGE.",

In a statement, a White House spokesperson disputed the idea that Kliger \"managed\" the firings at CFPB, but did not clarify his role. In an internal chat made public in the court filings, messages show Kliger claiming he would \"be running this operation.\"",
      "According to sworn testimony from a CFPB employee, Kliger allegedly demanded staffers prepare firing notices for 36 hours straight, \"screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough, calling them incompetent.\"",

      "The Hamas statement said the release was part of ongoing mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, reopen crossings into the Israeli-blockaded Palestinian territory and resume the delivery of aid. It did not say when the release would happen, but two Hamas officials told The Associated Press they expected it to take place within 48 hours.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it was aware of Hamas' plan to release Alexander, \"as a gesture to the Americans,\" in a statement to CBS News on Sunday.",
      "\"The United States has informed Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of the hostages under the original Witkoff outline \u2014 which Israel has already accepted,\" the office said, referencing terms negotiated by Steve Witkoff, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East.",
      "\"Israel is preparing for the possibility that this move will materialize,\" the statement continued. \"According to Israeli policy, the negotiations will take place under fire with a commitment to achieving all war goals.\"",
      "Witkoff confirmed late Sunday in a message to CBS News that Hamas had agreed to release Alexander.",
      "Alexander is a 20-year-old Israeli-American\u00a0national who grew up in New Jersey and was a soldier in the Israeli military when Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. He was abducted from a military base where he was stationed near the Gaza border \u2014 one of 251 people taken hostage that day from southern Israel, while 1,200 more were killed.",

I look very much forward to that day of celebration!\"",

We express our deepest gratitude to President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. administration for their tireless work to make this happen.",
      "\"We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop. We hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families. No hostage should be left behind.\"",
      "The hostage families forum had said earlier that it was \"embracing and supporting the Alexander family,\" and that Edan's release \"must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages.\"",

      "\"You've given the families of all the hostages hope,\" the statement said. \"Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.\"",
      "As fighting escalated at the military base on the morning of Oct. 7, Alexander sent a message to his mother, telling her that he had shrapnel caught in his helmet from surrounding explosions but found a protected area. His family lost contact with him after 7 a.m., The Associated Press reported.",
      "\"He told me even though things were already getting dangerous around him. That was the last time I heard my son's voice. I cannot describe the pain of not knowing where your child is or how is he,\" Alexander's mother, Yael Alexander, told CBS New York in October.",
      "She and his father, Adi Alexander, met with former President Joe Biden and President Trump late last year to push for a deal that would free all of the hostages still being held in Gaza. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that fewer than two dozen hostages were believed to be alive. Alexander was thought to be among them.",
      "As attempts to reach a permanent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas have drawn on, militants have periodically freed hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. About 100 hostages were returned to Israel during a brief pause in fighting in November 2023, just over a month after the Oct. 7 attack prompted Israel to declare war on Hamas and begin bombarding Gaza.",
      "Some of the people freed in that first exchange said they had seen Alexander in captivity. His grandmother, Varda Ben Baruch, told the Associated Press at the time that hostages had said her grandson kept his cool and encouraged them that everyone would be released soon.",
      "Fewer than 50 living people have been released from Hamas captivity since the temporary ceasefire in November 2023.",
      "Militants released 30 of the people between January and March of this year, as part of another exchange agreement with Israel that took place in several stages. Although family members of those in ongoing captivity have repeatedly pleaded with American and Israeli leaders to solidify a deal prioritizing the hostages' safe return, Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas in March and renewed its offensive in Gaza, where Palestinian officials said the death toll has risen to almost 53,000.",

    "summary": "Trade discussions between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng ended after a weekend of prolonged negotiations.",
    "story": [
      "\"Substantial progress\" was made in sensitive talks between the U.S. and Chinese delegations\u00a0this weekend over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy, the U.S. treasury secretary said on Sunday.",
      "Scott Bessent, along with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland over two days. In his statement Sunday, he offered scant information on exactly what negotiations entailed, but said more details would come at a briefing Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, Greer suggested that an agreement had been reached but provided no details. He and Bessent briefly addressed reporters once talks had wrapped at the stately villa that serves as the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, but did not take questions.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer said.",
      "But he also stressed that a top Trump administration priority means closing the U.S.\u00a0trade deficit\u00a0with China, which came to a record $263 billion last year.",
      "The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the first day of meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",
      "\"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\"",
      "The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union \u2013 the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

Jonathan Nichols, from the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, led the team. In a statement shared with NASA, he said their findings blew him away.",
      "\"We wanted to see how quickly the auroras change, expecting them to fade in and out ponderously, perhaps over a quarter of an hour or so,\" said Nichols. \"Instead, we observed the whole auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second.\"",
      "Learning more about the variability Nichols' team observed will help scientists better understand how Jupiter's atmosphere works, according to NASA.",
      "Webb's images of Jupiter may have also opened doors to new questions about the universe. When compared to images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which uses different wavelengths of light to capture them, scientists discovered that certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts.",
      "\"This has left us scratching our heads,\" Nichols told NASA. \"In order to cause the combination of brightness seen by both Webb and Hubble, we need to have a combination of high quantities of very low-energy particles hitting the atmosphere, which was previously thought to be impossible. We still don't understand how this happens.\"",

      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",

      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",
      "Gates, who is turning 70 years old this fall, said this move marks the beginning of the \"last chapter\" in his career. But he certainly hopes he's around to see the impact it makes.",
      "\"Well, I wish I had even more time. But I have to say, 'OK, this is the last part of my life. And I'm a steward of these resources,'\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should make sure that it's well spent. And now this is the last stage of all that.\"",
      "When asked if he'll miss his billion-dollar fortune, Gates chuckled.",

      "\"In light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the attorney general personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees until we get more answers,\" Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.",
      "Mr. Trump is making his first international trip of his second term this week, where he arrived in Saudi Arabia Tuesday before visiting Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the coming days. Meanwhile, an unprecedented offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate a jumbo jet for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane has sent shockwaves through the political sphere back home.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the possible gift \"so corrupt\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"would give a double take,\" while calling it a \"grave national security threat.\"",
      "The minority leader outlined a number of requests of the Justice Department, calling on its Foreign Agent Registration Act unit to disclose all activities by Qatari foreign agents inside the U.S. that could benefit Mr. Trump or his family's organization, while urging that the American people \"deserve to know the facts.\"",
      "Schumer asked who would install security measures on the jet, how the measures would be verified, what modifications would be needed to ensure its safety, along with who would pay for the installations and how much would they cost. He also asked what Qatar is being offered in return, while calling on the attorney general to testify before the House and Senate to explain why the gift does not violate any ethics law or the emoluments clause, which prohibits government officials from accepting compensation from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.",
      "\"Until the attorney general explains her blatantly inept decision, and we get answers to these questions, I will place a hold on all political nominees to the Department of Justice,\" Schumer said.",
      "The practical impact of the holds remains unclear. The holds would be expected to slow the nominations by requiring Senate Republicans to take each procedural vote rather than moving forward with the nominees under an expedited timeframe. And Justice Department nominees aren't voted on en bloc like military promotions, further delaying the process.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the Qatari government had \"graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,\" while noting that the details were still being worked out.

    "story": [
      "President Trump's ever-changing tariffs have caused some\u00a0confusion for Americans, as higher prices and expectations of empty store shelves threaten to change the ways consumers stock up on essentials.",
      "Assuaging concerns among consumers and on Wall Street\u00a0\u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 a U.S. agreement with China,\u00a0announced on Monday\u00a0by the White House, would effectively reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "President Trump also recently announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

    "story": [
      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "There are exceptions for the work requirement, however. The bill states that people who are under 19 years old as well as women who are pregnant or who are under postpartum medical care are among those who can receive a waiver.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order stated.",
      "The end of the de minimis exemption has upended the business models of companies like\u00a0Shein and Temu, leaving U.S. consumers\u00a0unable to procure\u00a0\u00a0affordable fashion from the popular e-commerce sites. Temu has\u00a0halted shipments\u00a0of goods from China to the U.S., and is now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based customers' orders and avoid tariffs.",
      "\"Temu's pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model. All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch last week.",

      "President Trump is delivering remarks Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit as the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including what it touted as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, announced multiple economic and defense agreements, an indication of Mr. Trump's intent to deepen U.S.-Saudi ties, despite long-held concerns from State Department reports and human rights groups about its restriction of civil liberties and political rights.",
      "Speaking at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, the president said it's a \"tremendous honor\" to be invited back to Saudi Arabia, where his first foreign trip took place in 2017, and called MBS a \"friend.\"",
      "\"The U.S.-Saudi relationship has been a bedrock of security and prosperity,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Today, we reaffirmed this important bond, and we take the next steps to make our relationship closer, stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"",
      "Specifically, the president and crown prince signed agreements for judicial cooperation between the Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Department of Justice, coordination between the Pentagon and Saudi Ministry of Defense for modernization and development of the capabilities of the Saudi armed forces; and an international partnership program between the Saudi Ministry of Interior and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
      "The package of agreements includes \"extensive training and support to build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical services,\" according to the White House. It also includes billions of dollars in investments in U.S. data centers.",
      "The president arrived in Saudi Arabia earlier Tuesday, the first stop on a four-day trip to the Middle East for Mr. Trump. The trip is his first of his second term. The president also visited Saudi Arabia before any other nation during his first term in the White House \u2014 bucking the tradition for presidents to make their first foreign trip to the United Kingdom, one of the United States' strongest allies.",
      "After Air Force One was escorted into landing by Saudi fighter jets, Mr. Trump was greeted on the tarmac at the airport in Riyadh by the kingdom's de facto ruler, the crown prince. After a coffee ceremony, Trump then went to the Royal Court, where he and bin Salman descended a lavender carpet as trumpets sounded to mark the president's arrival.",
      "Following the arrival ceremony, the president attended a delegation meeting and bilateral meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump complimented the Crown Prince in remarks during their bilateral meeting, calling him \"wise beyond his years.\" The president also said that the Saudi prince is considering a purchase of $600 billion of military equipment but joked that it could be $1 trillion.",
      "The two leaders also participated in a business lunch with notable CEOs including Elon Musk, Larry Fink, and Stephen Schwarzman. Mr. Trump said the business leaders are expected to walk away from the visit \"with a lot of checks.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The president and the crown prince held private talks earlier Tuesday which were expected to span a wide range of topics, from Iran's nuclear program to the war in Gaza and keeping oil prices in check.",
      "But the visit also focused on business, as the president has looked to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner. And Joining Mr. Trump at the investment summit were expected to be some high-profile business leaders, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments's Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Later this week, Mr. Trump will travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar has offered to donate a jumbo jet donated by the royal family of Qatar for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended accepting the gift of the plane, saying Monday \"I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",

    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss.

      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

      "Drug manufacturers that \"fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing\" voluntarily will have the prices imposed on them through new rules, which the White House says it is directing the Department of Health and Human Services to propose.",

No specific class of drugs is being targeted, they said, but they are planning to focus on drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices.",
      "Americans pay significantly more than citizens of other countries do for many of the same pharmaceutical drugs. Experts have blamed it on a range of factors, including a complex web of insurers, middlemen and providers that underpin the U.S. health care system, unlike other countries, which set prices through government-run health care systems.",
      "Industry's response to order",
      "The drug industry has opposed \"most favored nation\" pricing as a \"deeply flawed proposal,\" calling it \"importing socialized medicine\" and claiming it could upend small and mid-size biotech companies in the U.S.",
      "\"Applying other countries' antiquated approach to how they value \u2014 and pay \u2014 for medicines will stall investment across America's biotech companies, risk access to vital treatments and cures for millions of American patients, and lead to fewer American jobs,\" John F. Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said in a statement Monday.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Mr. Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \"upper hand\" in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",

      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-state-catholic-church-feds-child-abuse-reporting-law-priests/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 15:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Priests are required to report child abuse or neglect to Washington state law enforcement after learning about the crime through confessions.",
    "story": [
      "The Catholic Church and federal government reacted vehemently to new legislation in Washington state that requires priests to report child abuse or neglect to law enforcement after learning about the crime through confessions.",
      "Gov. Mike Ferguson signed the controversial bill into law last week, making it mandatory for all clergy to report child abuse, without exemptions for information disclosed during confession. Confessions were previously considered privileged.",
      "The Archdiocese of Seattle \u2014 which was made up of 160 priests and 90 permanent deacons\u00a0as of 2024\u00a0\u2014 said it will excommunicate priests who comply with the legislation. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice called the law \"anti-Catholic\" in a statement announcing a probe into the policy, just days before the Vatican selected the first pope from the United States.",
      "The Seattle Archdiocese in a statement, warned that breaking the confidence of confession is grounds for a priest to be kicked out of the church, essentially reiterating the rules already established for Catholic clergy.",
      "\"Catholic clergy may not violate the seal of confession \u2014 or they will be excommunicated from the Church,\" the Archdiocese said. \"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential and protected by the law of the Church.\"",
      "Too many victims",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice said it had opened a civil rights investigation into Washington's law, focusing on how it was developed and eventually passed. It suggested the legislation could be at odds with the First Amendment, with Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon saying the legislation \"demands that Catholic Priests violate their deeply held faith in order to obey the law.\"",
      "In the text of Washington's reporting law, \"clergy\" refers collectively to everyone ordained for religious duties in any religion, but confession as a practice is singled out because of the secrecy around it.",
      "Ferguson's office addressed the federal probe in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this 'investigation' from the Trump Administration,\" the statement said.",
      "Washington lawmakers are not the first to try to mandate clergy members to report child abuse, especially as the Catholic Church has increasingly faced public reckonings over sex crimes since the turn of the century. Although a majority of U.S. states already have abuse reporting mandates in place for religious leaders, each of those laws includes a provision exempting information learned through confession.",
      "California tried in 2019 to propose a bill that would have required clergy to report abuse without that exemption, but the church fought its passage and the legislature eventually put it on hold.",
      "The legislation was originally proposed by Washington State Senator Noel Frame, whose jurisdiction includes Seattle. After two earlier attempts to pass this bill failed because of disagreements about whether confessions should be exempt from reporting mandates, the final version passed during the legislative session this spring.",
      "\"Far too many children have been victims of abuse,\" said Frame in a statement once the latest bill had passed in the state Senate. \"The Legislature has a duty to act and end the cycles of abuse that can repeat generation after generation. When kids ask for help, we need to be sure that they get help. It's time to pass this bill once and for all.\"",
      "The seal of confession",
      "Thomas Plante, a psychologist and Santa Clara University professor who has worked with the church for decades and written extensively about child sexual abuse among clerics, said removing exemptions for confession could have unintentionally adverse effects.",
      "Plante told CBS News that the \"absolute\" confidentiality understood to apply in church confessions has, in his experience, encouraged people who have committed crimes to come clean to a priest who has then referred them to a psychologist such as himself.",
      "He said multiple patients were referred to him this way over his career, and he then reported the situation to authorities as a medical professional.",
      "\"The seal of confession, which is sort of a global thing that's been going on for several thousand years, is basically that anything you say under the seal is in complete confidence, and it gives people a place to talk about stuff they can't talk about anywhere else,\" Plante said. \"That's one advantage. People that are involved in a crime or abuse or anything else, they do have a place in the Catholic Church to talk about it with 100% confidentiality.\"",
      "Without that assurance, Plante said he suspects priests in Washington will stop offering confession and instead direct people to seek that service at churches in nearby states.",
      "\"And I think that would be a terrible tragedy,\" he said.",
      "Confession is a core principle in Catholicism. It calls for private conversations where congregants or laypeople divulge their wrongdoings to a priest, and, in turn, receive forgiveness on behalf of God. Anything said during the exchanges is kept secret.",
      "Technically, priests, through their religious oaths, are bound to a seal of confidentiality after hearing confessions, and the church forbids them from sharing the information learned in those sessions with others. Catholic doctrine explicitly prohibits them from notifying authorities even after someone has confessed to a crime.",
      "The Seattle Archdiocese said they agree \"with the goal of protecting children and preventing child abuse\" and are committed to reporting it, as long as the information is acquired in a setting outside of confession. It also accused the state of Washington of violating constitutional protections for religious establishment and free exercise of religion.",
      "\"With this law, the State of Washington is specifically targeting religious conduct by inserting the government into the Catholic tradition, namely, the highly defined ritual of the Sacrament of Reconciliation,\" the Archdiocese said.\"The state is now requiring priests to violate an essential element of the rite, the confidential communication between the priest and penitent in which the absolution of sin is offered.\"",
      "Washington's new law requires priests to share information from confession only if the person confessing admits to abusing a child.",
      "Last year, while Washington's current governor, Ferguson, was still the state's attorney general, he pushed to investigate Catholic church leadership in Seattle, Spokane and Yakima for allegedly using charitable funds to cover up allegations of child sex abuse by clergy. But the probe faced challenges as the church refused to cooperate, arguing it did not need to obey subpoenas for its records.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Kim Kardashian\u00a0took the witness stand Tuesday in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery in which a masked gang made off with $10 million worth of her jewelry as she visited the French capital. Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",
      "During Tuesday's testimony, Kardashian also responded directly to one of the defendants after she was read an apology letter in court.",
      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",
      "At the central Paris courthouse where the trial is taking place, there was intense security and crowd control measures in place. The court opened early to allow journalists and members of the public access ahead of Kardashian's afternoon appearance.",
      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing is not being broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "Kardashian's lawyers said she was determined to testify in person about the night she was allegedly tied up and robbed at gunpoint while she was in Paris for Fashion Week. Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "As they fled, they dropped a diamond and platinum cross that was found the next morning by a local resident. The rest of the haul has not been recovered.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery. Khedache, now 69, is accused of masterminding the heist. Known as \"Old Omar,\" he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was, but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "Khedache wrote to Kardashian in 2017, while he was in custody, to apologize. Her lawyers said he wrote after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "\"I want to reach out to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my actions, how much I was moved and touched to see your tears,\" Khedache wrote. \"Of course, we cannot undo the past but I hope this letter will make you gradually forget the traumatism you experienced through my fault.\"",
      "Kardashian wept as she listened, then said: \"I appreciate the letter. I forgive you for what happened. That said, it doesn't change my trauma nor the fact that my life was changed forever.\"",
      "Khedache responded: \"Your forgiveness is like the sun lighting me up. Thank you.\"",
      "Yunice Abbas, the 71-year-old who has already admitted in court that he was the lookout, told Kardashian: \"I formally, sincerely apologize.\"",
      "In court on April 29, he expressed \"total regret\" for his part in the heist. He said he understood afterward that, \"when you steal a lady's purse, it can be traumatic\" for her.",
      "A police officer who testified for the prosecution told the court Kardashian appeared \"traumatized\" in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.",
      "Lawyers for some of the accused expressed concern as the trial opened last month that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "Chloe Arnoux, who represents Khedache, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you, journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "Kardashian's lawyer Michael Rhodes said in April that the reality TV star and entrepreneur had ''tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system,'' and ''wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",

About a year of that time was spent in custody on remand as he awaited trial.",

      "Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of gas, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.",
      "Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.",
      "Sexual fluid found on Sindall's body could not be scientifically analyzed until recently.",

    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

      "\"The final end of the universe is coming much sooner than expected but fortunately it still takes a very long time,\" said lead author Heino Falcke.",
      "A trio of scientists at Radboud set out to calculate when the most \"durable\" celestial bodies \u2014\u00a0white dwarf stars \u2014 would eventually die out.",
      "They based their calculations on Hawking radiation, named after celebrated British physicist Stephen Hawking.",
      "Hawking postulated in the mid-1970s that black holes leak radiation, slowly dissolving like aspirin in a glass of water -- giving them a finite lifetime.",
      "The Radboud scientists extended this to other objects in the universe, calculating that the \"evaporation time\" depends on density.",
      "This enabled them to calculate the theoretical dissolution of the longest-lasting body, the white dwarf.",

      "If dark energy is constant, an idea first introduced by\u00a0Albert Einstein\u00a0in his theory of relativity,\u00a0 scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still. If dark energy ebbs with time, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\"",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",

At least five candidates backed by his family were also among those leading the race for 12 Senate positions, in a stronger-than-expected showing in Monday's midterm elections. Pre-election surveys had indicated only two of them would emerge victorious.",

      "Sara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will lose her job and be disqualified from holding public office forever. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of the 24 senators to vote in her favor.",
      "The official election results will be known within a week. But the partial and unofficial count by election watchdog Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting showed Duterte garnering more than half a million votes in his stronghold Davao City, nearly eight times more than his closest rival.",
      "His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, is also leading the unofficial vote count in the race for Davao vice mayor. His eldest son, Paolo, who is seeking reelection as a member of the House of Representatives, and two grandsons in local races were also in the lead, in an indication of the family's continued influence.",
      "\"Duterte landslide in Davao!\" his youngest daughter Veronica posted on Facebook.",
      "Duterte, nicknamed \"the Punisher\" and \"Dirty Harry,\" served as Davao's mayor for two decades before becoming president. He has been in the custody of the International Criminal Court since March, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over a brutal war on illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead during his 2016-2022 presidency. He was arrested at Manila's airport after arriving from Hong Kong, with police taking him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating mass killings that happened under his crackdown on illegal drugs.",
      "The impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions. Duterte supporters slammed Marcos' government for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.",
      "Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.",
      "Sara Duterte had told reporters after voting Monday that she was in talks with her father's lawyers on how he could take his oath as mayor despite being behind bars. She had said the vice mayor, widely expected to be Sebastian, would likely be the acting mayor.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has offered refugee status to dozens of Afrikaners from South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "A plane carrying dozens of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport on Monday, a State Department official said, after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States.",
      "The group \u2014 which includes families with children \u2014 was greeted at the D.C.-area airport by U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar. Landau told reporters the group has faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa \u2014 which the country's government has denied.",
      "Landau said the new arrivals were \"carefully vetted\" in South Africa prior to their arrival. They departed\u00a0Johannesburg via a charter plane on Sunday.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent \u2014 particularly Afrikaners, who are largely descended from Dutch settlers \u2014 to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program.",
      "The administration and its allies, including South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, allege members of South Africa's White minority have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government, including through a controversial law that allows the government to take private land in some circumstances.",
      "\"South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social in February.",
      "The South African government has strongly denied any discrimination, and argues the land seizure law respects private property rights and only targets land that isn't used or doesn't serve the public interest. Land ownership has long been a sensitive issue in South Africa, which was ruled by its White minority under the apartheid system until the mid-1990s.",
      "\"It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the U.S. from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,\" South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation said in a February statement.",
      "Landau also cited attacks on South African farmers in recent years, saying the new arrivals have faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government argues attacks in the country's rural farming communities are not racially targeted and are part of South Africa's broader crime problem.",
      "The Trump administration has also clashed with the South African government over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa.",
      "The South Africans moved through the refugee process at an unusually fast clip, arriving in the United States after a few months, even though the process frequently takes years.",
      "They also arrived in the United States despite a broader effort by the Trump administration to suspend the refugee admission program \u2014 a move that has drawn court challenges.",
      "Refugee group declines to help resettle South Africans",
      "The federal government typically relies on nonprofits to help resettle refugees in the United States, but at least one group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, said Monday it will not assist with the South African arrivals.",
      "Episcopal Bishop Sean Rowe said the government informed the group \u2014 which receives federal grants \u2014 that it would be expected to assist the South Africans. The group opted against assisting and will instead wind down its work with the government, he said, citing the group's \"steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation.\"",
      "\"It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,\" Rowe said in a statement.",
      "Some other refugee resettlement groups have indicated they are willing to work with the South Africans.",
      "Church World Service CEO Rick Santos criticized the government for restricting most other refugee admissions, but said the group \"remains committed to serving all eligible refugee populations seeking safety in the United States, including Afrikaners who are eligible for services,\" in a statement to the Associated Press.",

    "summary": "Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is awaiting trial for alleged crimes against humanity, was expected to win the race for Davao mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Even though he is detained in The Hague, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was among candidates who vied for some 18,000 national and local seats in Monday's midterm elections that analysts say will decide if he and his family continue to hold political power.",
      "Duterte has been in custody of the International Criminal Court since March, awaiting trial for alleged crimes against humanity over a brutal war on illegal drugs that has left thousands of suspects dead during his 2016-2022 presidency. It hasn't stopped him from running for mayor of his southern Davao city stronghold.",
      "Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.",
      "Duterte is widely expected to win as Davao mayor, a position he held for over two decades before becoming president. He had received half a million votes, against 60,000 for his closest rival, according to a partial and unofficial count of 62% of the votes, CBS News partner BBC reported.",
      "It's less clear how Duterte can practically serve as mayor from behind bars.",
      "Over 68 million Filipinos were registered to vote Monday for half of the 24-member Senate, all the 317 seats in the House of Representatives and various positions in provinces, cities and municipalities.",
      "Polls closed at 7 p.m. local time, and unofficial results started to be reported a few hours later. Official results would be announced within a week.",
      "The spotlight is on the race for the Senate that could determine the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.",
      "She faces an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over accusations of plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and corruption involving her office's intelligence funds. She has denied the allegations, saying they were spread by her political opponents to destroy her.",
      "Sara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will be removed as vice president and disqualified from holding public office. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of the 24 senators to vote in her favor.",
      "\"The 2025 midterm elections will be crucial because the results will set the pace for what will happen next, which family or faction will dominate the elections in 2028,\" said Maria Ela Atienza, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines.",
      "If Sara Duterte is convicted in the impeachment trial, it could signal the end of the Duterte family holding key positions in the country, she said. Other family members running in the election include Rodrigo Duterte's youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, who is now running for vice mayor and widely expected to win. The partial and unofficial count also put Sebastian in the lead, BBC reported.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte's eldest son Paolo is seeking reelection as a member of the House of Representatives. Two grandsons are also running in local races.",
      "The impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions.",
      "Earlier Monday, Sara Duterte voted in Davao while Marcos cast his ballot in his northern hometown, Batac City.",
      "She told reporters after casting her ballot she would accept the will of the electorate if candidates she backed did not win.",
      "Speaking about her father's expected win: \"Definitely, he will not be here, our expectation is the vice mayor (Sebastian) will be the acting mayor,\" she said.",
      "Marcos, in a video message on election eve, had urged Filipinos to vote and make their voice heard.",
      "Her father's spiritual adviser and close political ally, televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, is also running for a Senate seat despite being detained on charges of sexual abuse and human trafficking. He is also wanted in the U.S. on similar charges.",
      "Voting was marred by pockets of violence. In Silay City in central Philippines, police reported that two people died and seven others were hurt in a shooting. In the southern New Corella municipality, supporters of two candidates vying for mayor engaged in a gunfight, leaving two dead and two wounded. In southern Basilan, seven people were killed in suspected election-related shootings. Several others were also injured in shootings in other parts of the country.",
      "Fights between supporters of rival candidates also delayed balloting in some constituencies. In Manila, some voters complained their names were missing from the list in their precinct. Others grumbled about the long queue in stifling heat.",
      "Voter Reymark Marquez said the Marcos-Duterte team that won in 2022 failed to deliver on promises. He said the midterm elections are \"beyond Duterte versus Marcos but about choosing the right leaders.\"",
      "\"I think what is at stake in this election is the future of the next generation,\" Diana Joy Acosta, a 32-year-old new mother, said after casting her vote in a school in metropolitan Manila's Mandaluyong City. For her baby's future, she hopes for an end to corruption and the election of politicians with integrity.",

    "story": [
      "The United States suspended imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday.",
      "Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement that the screwworm, which is a parasite that could be fatal, was recently detected in remote farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border.",
      "\"The protection of our animals and safety of our nation's food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance,\" she said in a statement. \"Once we see increased surveillance and eradication efforts, and the positive results of those actions, we remain committed to opening the border for livestock trade. This is not about politics or punishment of Mexico, rather it is about food and animal safety.\"",
      "Mexico's Agriculture Secretary, Julio Berdegu\u00e9, said on social media that he had spoken with Rollins, who had informed him of the decision.",
      "\"We don't agree with this measure, but we're confident we'll reach an agreement sooner rather than later,\" Berdegu\u00e9 said.",
      "On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has spent the past few months scrambling to offset tariff threats by President Trump, described the Trump administration's decision as \"unfair.\" She said she hoped the suspension would not result in another economic blow for her country.",
      "\"We do not agree with this measure,\" she said at her morning press conference. \"The Mexican government has been working on all fronts from the very first moment we were alerted to the screwworm.\"",
      "What is a screwworm?",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals' skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal.",
      "Mexico's Health Ministry issued an epidemiological alert this month after the first human case of screwworm myiasis was confirmed on April 17 in a 77-year-old woman living in the southern state of Chiapas. Also this year, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department issued a warning in January about animals that may have been impacted by the dangerous \"maneater\" parasites.",
      "The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November following the detection of the pest but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country.",
      "But there has been an \"unacceptable northward advancement\" of the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"Additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly,\" the statement added.",
      "Over the last two years, screwworm has spread north throughout Panama and into Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and now Mexico, the department said.",

    "summary": "The White House says the U.S. and China have agreed to suspend for 90 days most of the tariffs imposed against each other over the last couple months.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",
      "UBS Global Wealth Management projects the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports will ultimately settle around 30% to 40%.",

It did not say when the release would happen, but two Hamas officials told The Associated Press they expected it to take place within 48 hours.",

      "Economist Peter St. Onge discusses fears of a recession and the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on 'The Will Cain Show.'",
      "The nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from the Federal Reserve that have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report.",
      "\"If you look at the amount of federal regulation, the amount of federal taxes, if anything\u2026 the economy has gotten less friendly toward big business, and toward rich people,\" economist Peter St. Onge told Fox News Digital in a May phone interview. \"What's actually been happening is that the Fed has been driving income inequality. And, I think for a long time, Republicans were sort of in denial \u2013 not just Republicans, but sort of free market types were in denial \u2013 and they didn't want to talk about income equality.\"",
      "\"I think they should absolutely talk about it, because what's causing it is not free markets,\" he said. \"It's something that I think everybody should oppose, which is government manipulation of the monetary system.\"",
      "St. Onge was reacting to data showing that billionaires' share of the GDP increased from 14.1% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2025, as reported by Johns Hopkins University economic professor Steve Hanke.",

      "The Federal Reserve is America's central bank, which sets monetary policies and oversees banks. It acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from the president or Congress when enacting policies.",
      "St. Onge explained to Fox News Digital that \"debt is a rich man's game\" and that billionaires have benefited financially since the pandemic as the Fed worked to \"manipulate interest rates\" down below market value, which subsidized loans.",
      "\"During COVID, you could get a mortgage for, you know, three, three and a half percent, when inflation was running higher than that,\" he explained. \"You were literally being paid to borrow money, which is not a free market outcome.\u2026 So it makes loans cheap and the rich overwhelmingly borrow money.\"",
      "ELON MUSK WARNS FEDERAL RESERVE MAY FACE DOGE AUDIT",
      "The average debt for the top 5% of Americans sits at about $600,000, he said, while the average debt for the vast majority of Americans is roughly $74,000.",
      "\"That's about a nine times difference,\" he said of the data. \"So if you make loans too cheap, you are giving nine times more money to rich people.\u2026 If you make loans cheap, you're functionally giving $9 to rich people for every $1 to give everybody else.\"",
      "Assets are even more skewed, he explained, with the top 5% of Americans holding $7.8 million in assets compared to the average American's $62,000 \u2013 notching 130 times the difference between the two demographics, he said.",
      "\"The value of a stock or even a house are based on the future stream of income, and those are all discounted by the interest rate,\" he said. \"And so pretty close to mechanically, if you cut interest rates in half \u2013 long-term interest rates \u2013 you are doubling the value of stocks.\"",
      "The nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from the Federal Reserve that have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report. (Jason Reed/File Photo/Reuters)",
      "St. Onge pointed to the American economy in the 1970s and the early 2000s, outlining that growth \"took a big step down\" in the 2000s while asset values, such as housing prices and the stock market, skyrocketed.",
      "\"The reason is because, since the 1970s, the Fed has very aggressively held rates low, and so this has caused all those assets to go up. So stocks have gone up, housing has gone up. And again, those are rich men's games. Overwhelmingly, people who own stocks are rich. Housing is even more skewed.\"",
      "\"So if you've got a nine times difference on loans between the bottom 50% and the top 5%, and then you've got 130 times on assets, then the Fed manipulating rates down \u2013 they're not doing it to make rich people rich, hopefully \u2013 but that's sort of the consequence of doing that,\" he said. \"Holding long-term interest rates low is to shower money on rich people and to shower it in proportion to which they're rich, right? So the most extreme version of that is going to be billionaires.\"",

      "\"In 2020, billionaires' share of GDP was 14.1%. Now, it's 21.1%. The Fed increased the money supply, asset prices went up, & guess who owns the assets? Billionaires. By ignoring the money supply, the Fed is an ENGINE OF INCOME INEQUALITY,\" he posted to X in April of his findings.",
      "The Federal Reserve acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from President Donald Trump or Congress when enacting policies. (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)",
      "\"Take the Federal Reserve\u2019s excessive money printing during the pandemic,\" Hanke said in an interview published by the think tank in April. \"The transmission mechanism of monetary policy roughly dictates that changes in the money supply are followed by changes in asset prices in 1\u20139 months\u2019 time, changes in real economic activity in 6\u201318 months\u2019 time, and finally changes in the price level in 12\u201324 months\u2019 time.\"",
      "\"Thanks to the Fed\u2019s helicopter money drops beginning with COVID, the annual growth rate of the US broad money supply peaked at 18.1% per year in May 2021,\" he added. \"Lo and behold, the transmission mechanism followed \u2013 the S&P 500 reached a local maximum in December 2021 (6 months later), and inflation peaked at 9.1% per year in July 2022 (14 months later).\"",

      "St. Onge said the Fed's policies have been political in nature, while remarking he would welcome \"naive\" Democrats who bang the proverbial campaign drum of income inequality to jump onto the \"end the Fed bandwagon.\"",
      "\"They have a naive argument where they look at rich people and they say, \u2018Hey, this is so terrible. We live in this dog-eat-dog jungle of an economy,'\" St. Onge said of Democrats who campaign on income inequality. \"And that is inaccurate,\" he added, citing Federal Reserve policies that have amplified income inequality.",

      "What sets the Ability Hand apart?",
      "When it comes to prosthetic hands, there are a lot of options out there, but the Ability Hand brings some truly unique features to the table. Here's a look at what makes it stand out from the rest:",
      "One of the most impressive features of the Ability Hand is its integrated pressure sensors in the fingertips. When you grip something, these sensors detect how much force you're applying and send a gentle vibration to your arm, giving you sensory feedback. This means users can handle delicate objects with greater confidence and precision, something that was previously impossible with traditional prosthetics.",
      "The Ability Hand offers an impressive variety of grip patterns, 32 in total, with 19 ready to use right now. Whether you need a strong power grip for lifting or a delicate pinch for picking up small items, this hand adapts easily. Customized grips are also available for those who want something tailored.",
      "Weighing just 1.08 pounds lighter than the average human hand, the Ability Hand is comfortable for all-day use. All five fingers flex and extend naturally, and the thumb can rotate both electrically and manually, allowing for a wide range of motions that feel intuitive and lifelike.",
      "Charging is simple with a USB-C port, taking about an hour to fully charge. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours, depending on use. A neat bonus: you can even charge your phone directly from the Ability Hand. The hand is also compatible with most third-party control systems, including EMG pattern recognition and force-sensitive resistors, making it a flexible option for many users.",
      "Durability is key for any prosthetic, and the Ability Hand doesn't disappoint. Each finger is designed to withstand blunt force impacts without breaking. Plus, it's water-resistant with an IP64 rating, so it can handle everyday spills and splashes without worry.",

      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",

      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",

      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",
      "The road ahead",
      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "A person texting on their phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "When you are abroad, reliable messaging becomes even more critical. SMS is the most dependable option and works almost everywhere, making it a safe choice for staying connected. MMS, on the other hand, can be inconsistent overseas due to differences in network standards and carrier agreements. RCS is even less predictable outside your home country, as it relies on mobile data or Wi-Fi and often does not function while roaming unless your carrier specifically enables it for international use.",

      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",

      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "Why this technology matters",
      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot represents an exciting fusion of robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and medicine. It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company\u2019s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within. With strong funding and a growing portfolio of patents, Robeaut\u00e9 is poised to make a lasting impact on the future of neurosurgery.",

      "When sending photos from an iPhone to an Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.",

      "Which messaging apps preserve photo quality?",
      "Several third-party messaging apps, such as FaceBook Messenger and Telegram, allow you to keep your photo files at their original size, ensuring that quality doesn't decrease. However, not all messaging apps are created equal. Several, such as WhatsApp, still somewhat reduce image quality, although it is still a higher quality image transfer than you would see via MMS.",

However, while Snapseed can upscale the resolution of your photographs, it won't be able to restore any data that has been lost during the photo compression process. It's a free app, and I found it to be one of the easiest ways to upscale image quality on your iPhone.",

Thankfully, with the introduction of RCS messaging on iPhones, you can now send uncompressed images, significantly improving quality. Additionally, utilizing cloud services like Google Photos or third-party messaging apps can help maintain image clarity.

      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "27-inch light-field display (Looking Glass)",
      "How it works",
      "The\u00a0Looking Glass 27 uses light-field display technology, which projects multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. This allows for \"Super Multi View\" experiences, where everyone around the screen can see a slightly different angle, just like in the real world. It\u2019s a step beyond traditional 3D displays, offering richer depth cues and a more natural viewing experience.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The display can showcase single images, 3D videos or interactive applications, and it\u2019s flexible enough to handle everything from quick model previews to fully interactive group experiences.",

      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

      "Looking Glass has made it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to build, test and deploy 3D applications. Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets.

    "story": [
      "Driverless semitrucks raise questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry.",
      "Aurora, a leader in autonomous vehicles, has officially deployed its driverless trucks on Texas roads, marking a key milestone in the evolution of transportation.",
      "This development raises important questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What's happening?",
      "Aurora's autonomous trucks now operate on routes between Dallas and Houston, hauling commercial loads.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "This isn't just a test program; it's a full deployment of driverless technology. Additional trucks will start operating on public roads in New Mexico and Arizona by the end of 2025, traveling at speeds ranging from 25 to 75 mph.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries. A third-party audit by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards. This audit also praised Aurora's safety culture and oversight practices.",

      "THE FUTURE OF TRUCKING ROLLS FORWARD IN SHELL'S EXPERIMENTAL BIG RIG",
      "Industry pushback: OOIDA and Teamsters raise concerns",
      "The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), representing over 150,000 truckers, strongly questions Aurora's safety claims.",
      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",
      "\"Exemptions from FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) safety rules weaken proven standards,\" OOIDA argues. The association wants mandatory crash and disengagement reporting and warns against removing trained drivers from the cab entirely.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union representing more than 1.2 million workers in North America, shares similar safety concerns.",
      "\"The Aurora Driver can't operate in severe weather like ice, unplowed snow or torrential rain,\" said Matt McQuaid, communications project manager for the Teamsters. He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",
      "Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\"",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "Industry voices weigh in",
      "John D. Esparza, president of the Texas Trucking Association, praised Aurora for its rigorous safety protocols,\u00a0saying, \"Their attention to safety is evident. The pursuit of perfection is necessary.\"",
      "Jeff Farrah, CEO of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, emphasized the broader significance:\u00a0\"Autonomous trucks are a triumph of American ingenuity and will ease supply chain issues.\"",

      "Aurora's deployment of autonomous trucks in Texas offers a glimpse into the future of transportation. The benefits of increased efficiency and the potential for safer roads are compelling. However, it's crucial to keep a close eye on how this technology develops. We need independent verification of safety claims and a proactive approach to managing the impact on jobs. The key will be ensuring that as driverless trucks hit the roads, we also support the workers affected by this transition.",

      "An \"agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,\" the U.S. official said. \"We are encouraged by today\u2019s outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\"",

The Trump administration vehemently opposes a uranium enrichment program on Iranian soil.",
      "\"Iran is trying to save its enrichment operation at a lower level and also not accepting any pressure to halt its anti-Israel stance. Khamenei's speech [Saturday] highlighted that second point. But at this point, the main issue is dismantling Iran's uranium enrichment,\" Soghom told Fox News Digital.",
      "Khamenei also lashed out at Israel during his Saturday speech in Tehran, declaring about Israel\u2019s war campaign to root out Iran-backed Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip that \"The people of Gaza are not facing Israel alone\u2014they are facing America and Britain.\"",
      "Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran, told Fox News Digital that\u00a0\"The Iranians, like last round, sound more downcast than the U.S. side, describing talks as difficult.\"",
      "In 2018, President\u00a0Trump withdrew from former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because the accord failed to prevent Tehran from building a nuclear weapons device, according to the first Trump administration.",

      "President Trump\u2019s\u00a0Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently stressed that\u00a0Iran cannot have an enrichment program during an interview with Breitbart News prior to Sunday\u2019s bargaining session.",
      "Witkoff said \"First of all, we\u2019re never doing a JCPOA deal where sanctions come off and there\u2019s no sunsetting of their obligations. That doesn\u2019t make sense. That was a mismatched procedure in JCPOA. We believe that they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon. We believe in all of that. That was not JCPOA. JCPOA had sunset provisions that burned off the obligations and burned off the sanctions relief at inappropriate times. It\u2019s never going to happen in this deal.\"",
      "Brodsky said that \"All in all, both sides want to keep the process moving. The Iranians will usually say and do enough to earn another meeting as they stand to lose more by this process breaking down than the U.S. government. The negotiating process is as important to the Iranians as the agreement itself as the process offers insulation from the impact of sanctions\u2014with the rial strengthening since talks started\u2014and protection from a military strike.",
      "\"This is why Iran will want these negotiations to continue for as long as possible. They will try to wear out and exhaust U.S. negotiators into concessions, which the Trump administration should reject. As President Trump said in a different context, Tehran does not have the cards here.\"",

The Europeans faced intense criticism when they agreed\u2014independent of the U.S.\u2014to allow the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium during the nascent phase of atomic talks during the early years of this century.",
      "Brodsky said\u00a0\"The original sin of U.S. decision-making on Iran\u2019s nuclear program was when the Obama administration changed the U.S. position from zero enrichment to tolerating enrichment at 3.67%. That laid the groundwork for Iran to retain the capability to continue to use its nuclear program to extort the United States and ultimately build a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "The nuclear expert noted, \"That should end today, and recent comments from President Trump, Special Envoy Witkoff, and Secretary Rubio hopefully signal that this era is over. House and Senate Republicans were also very clear on this point over the last week. The Iranians say they want a durable deal. But a JCPOA 2.0\u2014tolerating enrichment at 3.67% and no dismantlement of nuclear facilities\u2014would not be one.",
      "\"The Iranians are engaged in all kinds of gimmicks to dress up a variation of the same concessions they offered to President Obama. That should be unacceptable to American negotiators.\"",

      "Former Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita, Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort, and strategist and pollster Tony Fabrizio round out the team backing Berisha, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0LaCivita has compared Trump and Berisha, saying they are both \"unfairly prosecuted and persecuted by a government that has no regard for Democracy.\"",
      "When asked by Syri TV\u2019s Cim Peka why the Albanian election is important for the world, LaCivita said that \"one of the things that many of us know in the United States is that the Soros family is very active in politics around the globe, and it\u2019s not just regular politics, it\u2019s destabilizing politics.\" LaCivita said that the family thrives \"in an environment where the governments are insecure and they found the perfect home unfortunately in Albania, and they found the perfect prime minister in Edi Rama.\"",

      "The Socialist Rama is hoping to win a fourth consecutive term as PM in Sunday's election on a promise of bringing Albania into the European Union while the country still faces major problems of graft and corruption.",
      "LaCivita explained that calling out Soros\u2019 involvement was important \"because it has an impact on Albania\u2019s future.\" He said that Berisha\u2019s campaign is \"about the Albanian people,\" explaining that their \"biggest desire is to be able to work, live, and raise a family and have a future and so any time that there are individuals or that there are organizations that want to create an atmosphere that make that difficult, to me they\u2019re the actual enemy and those are the people that we wage campaigns to actually defeat.\"",

      "When Fox News Digital spoke to Berisha in April about the impediments he faced in the May 11 elections, he named the sanctions placed against him by the Biden administration for allegations of corruption in 2021. \"I\u2019m not able to meet with Albanian Americans, which are so numerous, and in this election, for the first time, they have the right to vote for the party and candidate they prefer in their country of origin,\" Berisha explained.",

      "To date, there appears to be no movement on sanctions against Berisha. In April, the State Department did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether it would consider lifting sanctions against Berisha, and whether the sanctions in place impeded free and fair elections in Albania. A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Thursday that \"the Department has nothing to report on this designation at this time.\"",
      "Berisha\u2019s race has been fraught by other complications, including being stripped of his legal immunity in December 2023 and held under house arrest until November 2024. Berisha is currently awaiting trial on corruption charges.",
      "Berisha told Fox News Digital that the charges were the product of lawfare leveled against him by Rama and Soros.",
      "Berisha is not the only opposition candidate who has faced charges in the lead-up to elections. Former Albanian president Ilir Meta was also arrested on corruption allegations in October 2024.",

The regime stands accused of jailing opposition leaders on fabricated charges, weaponizing state institutions, and silencing dissent in a country where citizens are increasingly afraid to speak freely.\"",
      "Nesho claimed that \"the Albanian people are being denied the basic democratic rights to organize, vote, and oppose the government without fear. This system of repression, critics say, is supported\u2014either tacitly or directly\u2014by elements of the Biden administration and global actors like Alex Soros, who have worked to undercut the opposition and prevent free and fair elections, much like the political persecution seen in the United States against former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Saying that the \"election could mark a turning point,\" as \"a true grassroots movement is rising\u2014ready to challenge state corruption and restore Albania\u2019s path to freedom, development, and democratic self-determination,\" Nesho called \"on the Trump administration to closely monitor these elections and send a clear message to Tirana: America is watching.\"",

      "Nesho said \"the United States must stand firmly on the side of democracy and the rule of law. The Albanian people deserve free elections, not another manipulated outcome enforced through fear and political imprisonment.\"",

      "\u201cI am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,\u201d Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.",

    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday he is placing a hold on all Trump Justice Department nominees as he seeks answers on the administration's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar to be used as Air Force One.",
      "\"In light of the deeply troubling news of a possible Qatari-funded Air Force One, and the reports that the Attorney General personally signed off on this clearly unethical deal, I am announcing a hold on all DOJ political nominees, until we get more answers,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor.",
      "The minority leader presented a list of questions and demands he says the Trump administration must respond to before he lifts his hold on nominees.",
      "\"President Trump has told the American people this is 'a free jet.' Does that mean the Qataris are delivering a ready-on-day-one plane with all the security measures already built in? If so, who installed those security measures, and how do we know they were properly installed?\" Schumer asked. \"If this is, as President Trump promised, a free jet, will the Qataris pay for those highly sensitive installations, or will American taxpayers cover the cost?\"",
      "Schumer can\u2019t block these nominees with this tactic, but he can slow down their consideration. It\u2019s not really clear if the judicial nominees would have already been held for other reasons, considering that the vast majority of Trump nominees have already been held in this way.",
      "The Office of Legal Counsel at the DOJ prepared a memo declaring that the acceptance of the plane was legal, a senior DOJ official told NBC News on Monday. The DOJ declined to release the memo, which Attorney General Pam Bondi approved.",
      "Schumer, in his remarks Tuesday, called on Bondi to testify before Congress to explain the conclusion that there is no conflict and answer a number of questions related to the potential gift.",
      "\u201cThe attorney general must testify before both the House and Senate to explain why gifting Donald Trump a private jet does not violate the emoluments clause \u2014 which requires congressional approval \u2014 or any other ethics laws,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cUntil the attorney general explains her blatantly inept decision and we get complete and comprehensive answers to these and other questions, I will place a hold on all political nominees to the Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "Schumer also accused DOJ of not \"doing its job\" when it comes to the Foreign Agent Registration Act, saying that the unit that oversees adherence to the law needs to enforce it and disclose information to the public \"not just on this luxury plane deal, but all deals involving foreign countries in the Middle East and President Trump, his family and the Trump Organization.\"",
      "Reached for comment Tuesday, a White House spokesperson said: \u201cSenator Schumer and his anti-law-and-order party are prioritizing politics over critical DOJ appointments, obstructing President Trump\u2019s Make Safe Again agenda. Cryin\u2019 Chuck must end the antics, stop Senate stonewalling, and prioritize the safety and civil rights of Americans.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Before leaving for his trip to the Middle East on Monday, Trump defended his decision to accept the airplane gift, which he called \u201ca very nice gesture.\u201d He also said it would eventually be decommissioned and be given to his presidential library.",
      "\u201cNow I could be a stupid person and say, \u2018Oh no, we don\u2019t want a free plane,\u2019\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cI would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.\u201d",
      "Boeing had already been working on a plan to deliver Air Force One replacements, but the process has been delayed and has been over-budget. The company\u2019s CEO told CNBC in January that it was working with Elon Musk to deliver them sooner than expected.",
      "Meanwhile, some legal experts have questioned how a\u00a0gift from Qatar that would follow Trump out of office could be permissible under the emoluments clause. Democrats and even some Trump allies have suggested the jet could be perceived as a conflict of interest.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a close ally of the president's, told CNBC on Tuesday that \"the plane poses significant\u00a0espionage and surveillance problems.\"",
      "Some Democrats have also questioned Bondi's involvement in the matter as she has previously lobbied for the government of Qatar.",
      "\u201cShe was a paid agent of the Qatari government, a lobbyist before she became attorney general,\" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Tuesday. \"We have questions that we\u2019ve asked about how she cleared her ethics statement on her relationship with Qatar, and I think that this plane deal is really with that front and center.\"",
      "Lawmakers and former intelligence officials note the massive spying risks posed by such a gift from a foreign government and the long history of gifts that turned out to be more than they appeared.\u00a0In 1945, for example, Soviet children gifted the U.S. ambassador in Moscow a wooden carving of America's Great Seal, and a listening device inside the object was discovered seven years later.",
      "Accusations that Trump has unlawfully benefited from foreign entities are nothing new. They arose during his first term but the legal question was never resolved before he left office.",
      "At issue in those cases were claims under the\u00a0emoluments clauses, which are anticorruption provisions that prevent the president from receiving payments from the states or gifts or payments from foreign officials.",
      "There is no Supreme Court precedent on the subject to guide lower courts on how the clauses can be enforced or even who can sue."

    "story": [
      "After months of delays, Erik and Lyle Menendez may be one step closer to learning if they'll be free.",
      "The brothers have each spent more than three decades in prison for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, and they\u2019ve been waiting since October to be heard on a prosecutor\u2019s recommendation that their sentences of life without the possibility of parole be reduced to 50 years to life.",
      "That recommendation, if approved by Los Angeles County Superior Judge Michael Jesic after what is expected to be two days of hearings beginning Tuesday, would make Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, eligible for parole immediately.",
      "A decision on the matter has been hamstrung by forces inside and outside the courtroom.\u00a0Those delays have helped fuel an increasingly bitter debate over a question at the heart of the criminal justice system: What does someone convicted of first-degree murder have to do to show they\u2019ve been rehabilitated?",
      "George Gasc\u00f3n, the former Los Angeles County district attorney who recommended that the brothers be resentenced, believed that they had been exceptional inmates.",
      "In an interview last year with \u201cDateline\u201d and in court filings, Gasc\u00f3n and his deputies pointed to the college courses the brothers have completed; to the green space \u201cbeautification\u201d project they established at the Southern California prison where they\u2019re incarcerated; and to the assistance they've provided to inmates with severe disabilities.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n also pointed to state law that requires authorities to consider how old inmates were when they committed their crimes. If they were younger than 26 \u2014 the age at which the part of the brain responsible for behavior control is considered fully mature \u2014 California law mandates that inmates be given a \u201cmeaningful opportunity for parole during their natural life.\u201d",
      "When the brothers fatally shot Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez on Aug. 20, 1989, Lyle Menendez was 21. Erik Menendez was 18.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s position has been championed by some high-profile celebrities and relatives of Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez who have continued to speak out on behalf of the brothers.",
      "\"I know Lyle and Eric,\" Anamaria Baralt, a cousin, said outside a Los Angeles courthouse last week. \"I've seen their journeys, and they are absolutely well-suited for this process, for resentencing, and I have no doubt that if we stay fair throughout these proceedings that we will see them out.\"",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n was voted out in November, and his successor, Nathan Hochman, has taken a very different view of the case.",
      "After seeking a delay for a resentencing hearing that had originally been scheduled in December, Hochman has said that he and his deputies spent months reviewing thousands of pages of trial transcripts, prison records and other documents associated with the case.",
      "In March, Hochman revealed that he did not believe Erik and Lyle Menendez had taken full responsibility for their crimes and moved to withdraw Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s recommendation. The district attorney cited a list of 16 \u201cunacknowledged lies\u201d that he said the brothers have told about the murders, including their claim that they killed their parents in self-defense. (Jesic has denied Hochman's attempt to withdraw.)",
      "When the brothers were tried in the early 1990s, Lyle testified that they fatally shot their parents after he confronted his father about sexually abusing Erik and Jos\u00e9 appeared to threaten him.",
      "They\u00a0claimed a legal doctrine known as \u201cimperfect self-defense.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors described the killings as cold-blooded \u2014 Lyle reloaded his shotgun before he shot his mother in the face \u2014 and financially motivated. The proceedings ended with a mistrial when the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict.",
      "During their second trial, Lyle declined to testify after authorities intercepted letters that showed him encouraging people to lie for the defense, including a girlfriend whom he asked to falsely claim that she\u2019d been sexually assaulted by his father, according to an appeals court decision. A ruling from the California Supreme Court also barred the brothers from claiming imperfect self-defense.",
      "On March 20, 1996, they were convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "In addition to their self-defense claim, Hochman has also included Lyle\u2019s apparent deception involving the girlfriend on his list of 16 unacknowledged lies. During a hearing last month, the deputy district attorney handling the resentencing argued that the brothers have offered a variety of excuses for their actions.",
      "\u201cWhat did you not hear once?\u201d said the prosecutor, Habib Balian. \u201cWe lied.\u201d",
      "An attorney for the brothers, Mark Geragos, called Balian's presentation a \"dog and pony show\" and accused him of relitigating the first trial.",
      "That hearing was supposed to determine whether Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced. But the proceedings ended with Geragos accusing the prosecution of bias and saying he would seek to have the district attorney removed from the case.",
      "During a hearing last week, Geragos withdrew that motion and prosecutors pointed to a new development that they said supports their claim that the brothers have not been sufficiently rehabilitated. Recent evaluations conducted by psychologists found that the brothers pose a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of violence if released from prison.",
      "The evaluations, known as comprehensive risk assessments, are confidential and were conducted as part of a separate clemency request the brothers made to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Speaking after last week\u2019s hearing, Geragos said that violations cited in the evaluations do not constitute the kind of serious felony crimes required to deny their resentencing bid. And he said that the prosecution\u2019s claims have sought to \u201cundercut what is 35 years of remarkable work by both brothers.\u201d",
      "If Jesic denies resentencing, the brothers still have two other paths to freedom \u2014 their application for clemency and a separate petition that challenges their convictions and seeks a new trial.",
      "CORRECTION\u00a0(May 13, 2025; 10.35 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated who Hochman is. He is Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s successor as Los Angeles County district attorney, not predecessor."

    "story": [
      "Consumer prices climbed last month at the slowest pace since February 2021, as the inflationary effects of President Donald Trump's tariffs had yet to hit Americans' wallets.",
      "The Consumer Price Index, which tracks a variety of costs throughout the economy, rose 2.3% year on year in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March.",
      "Analysts said the slower price growth may still not prompt the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with managing inflation, from lowering interest rates. Trump has repeatedly called for the central bank to do so, bashing its decision last week to hold rates steady.",
      "The latest inflation reading is \"likely a welcome reprieve for the Fed; however, the larger tariff-related price adjustments are likely to come over the next few months,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday. \"Consequently, we still anticipate them remaining on the sidelines in the near term.\"",
      "Even as the pace of price growth has slowed, consumers now report unprecedented levels of uncertainty amid fast-changing headlines about how Trump\u2019s tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "\u201cTariffs are now on top of consumers\u2019 minds, with mentions of tariffs reaching an all-time high,\u201d the Conference Board, which releases a closely watched monthly consumer-sentiment survey, said late last month. \u201cConsumers explicitly mentioned concerns about tariffs increasing prices and having negative impacts on the economy.\u201d",
      "The White House's back-and-forth tariff announcements are likely to have a whipsawing effect on inflation readings for months to come, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Asset Management financial group.",
      "\"A clear read on the inflation trend won\u2019t be visible for several months yet,\" she wrote in a note Tuesday. \"This prolonged inflation uncertainty likely implies a prolonged Fed pause.\"",
      "Stock markets appeared to shrug off the inflation report, with the three major U.S. indexes largely flat in Tuesday morning trading.",
      "Trump has asserted that there is \"virtually no inflation,\" and some major consumer categories are indeed seeing price declines. Today, regular unleaded fuel costs about $3.16 per gallon, down from $3.62 a year ago, according to AAA. Overall energy costs are also slightly lower, government data show, though some analysts have warned the decreases could reflect slower energy demand \u2014 a trend that could reverse during the summer months.",
      "Grocery price growth also saw its sharpest slowdown since 2023 last month, largely driven by falling egg costs. Prices for that staple have settled at a much higher level than just months ago, however, and economists expect Trump's trade war to ripple across supermarket shelves in sometimes hard-to-predict ways over the coming months.",
      "Inflation, at any rate, is still hotter than many households would like and has hovered just above the Fed's 2% target level for nearly the past year. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d inflation measure, which strips out food and energy, was up 2.8% in April, the same rate as in March.",
      "Housing continues to be a major culprit: Shelter costs are one-third of the CPI report, and they've have continued to rise, although not as quickly as during the Biden administration. While 12-month rent growth has slowed, at 4% it is about equal to pre-pandemic highs. The BLS\u2019 official measure of overall housing costs is also at 4%, higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "In general, uncertainty continues to reign from Main Street shops to executive boardrooms, spanning fireworks distributors, border towns and travel agencies.",
      "\u201cIt is currently hard to judge the underlying pace of growth of the U.S. economy,\u201d Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler said in remarks Monday, because Trump\u2019s tariffs continue to distort economic data.",
      "Her comments were prepared before the 90-day U.S.-China tariff pause unveiled Monday, but even the reduced 30% effective import tax on Chinese goods is still expected to put pressure on what Americans pay for many items. The Yale Budget Lab estimated Monday that consumers will continue to face an average effective tariff\u00a0of 17.8%, the highest since 1934.",
      "\u201cGiven these expected price increases, real incomes will fall, and operating costs will rise, which will lead consumers to demand fewer final goods and services and firms to demand fewer inputs,\u201d Kugler said. \u201cUltimately, I see the U.S. as likely to experience lower growth and higher inflation.\u201d"

      "BEIJING \u2014 The U.S.-China\u00a0tariff cuts, even if temporary, address a major pain point: Christmas presents.",
      "Nearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales last year came from the Christmas holiday season,\u00a0according to CNBC calculations based on data from the National Retail Federation. The period saw a 4% year-on-year sales increase to a record $994.1 billion.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "\u201cWith the speed of Chinese factories, this 90-day window can resolve most of the product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season,\u201d Ryan Zhao, director at export-focused company Jiangsu Green Willow Textile, said Monday in Chinese, translated by CNBC.",
      "His company had paused production for U.S. clients last month. He expects orders to resume but not necessarily to the same levels as before the new tariffs kicked in since U.S. buyers have found alternatives to China-based suppliers in the last few weeks.",
      "U.S. retailers typically place orders months in advance, giving factories in China enough lead time to manufacture the products and ship them to reach the U.S. ahead of major holidays. The two global superpowers\u2019 sudden doubling of tariffs in early April forced some businesses to halt production,\u00a0raising questions\u00a0about whether supply chains would be able to resume work in time to get products on the shelves for Christmas.",
      "\u201cThe 90-day window staves off a potential Christmas disaster for retailers,\u201d Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said Monday.",
      "\u201cIt does not help Father\u2019s Day [sales] and there will still be impact on back-to-school sales, as well as added costs for tariffs and logistics so prices will be going up overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But U.S. duties on Chinese goods aren\u2019t completely gone.",
      "The Trump administration added 20% in tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year in two phases, citing the country\u2019s alleged role in the\u00a0U.S. fentanyl crisis. The addictive drug, precursors to which are mostly produced in China and Mexico, has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S.",
      "The subsequent tit-for-tat trade spat saw duties skyrocketing over 100% on exports from both countries.",
      "While most of those tariffs have been paused for 90 days under the new deal the U.S. and China announced Monday, the previously imposed tariffs will remain in place.",
      "UBS estimates that the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products now stands around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties imposed in past years.",
      "For running shoes produced in China, the total tariff is now 47%, still well above the 17% level in January, said Tony Post, CEO and founder of Massachusetts-based Topo Athletic. He said his company received some cost reductions from its China factories and suppliers, but still had to raise prices slightly to offset the tariff impact.",
      "\u201cWhile this is good news, we\u2019re still hopeful the two countries can reach an acceptable permanent agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed to our Chinese suppliers and are relieved, at least for now, that we can continue to work together.\u201d",
      "U.S. retail giant\u00a0Walmart\u00a0declined to confirm the impact of the reduced tariffs on its orders from China.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by the progress made over the weekend and will have more to say during our earnings call later this week,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNBC. The U.S. retail giant is set to report quarterly results Thursday.",
      "China\u2019s exports to the U.S.\u00a0fell more than 20% in April\u00a0from a year ago, but overall Chinese exports to the world rose 8.1% during that time, official data showed last week. Goldman Sachs estimated around\u00a016 million Chinese jobs\u00a0are tied to producing products for the U.S."

      "The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d alum\u2019s post was the first he had uploaded since Dec. 10. At the time, he promoted \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d arriving on Netflix and shared a video of him talking about why the adaptation was meaningful. He also included behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew making the movie on set.",

In response to her claims, Justin Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, sent a statement to TODAY.com referring to the accusations as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "About a week later, on Dec. 31, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against the actor and his production company, Wayfarer Studios. In the lawsuit, she alleged that there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d her attorney said in a statement shared with NBC News. She also named producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel in the lawsuit.",

      "\u201cWhat I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It\u2019s what keeps us silent,\u201d Lively shared.",
      "She added, \u201cI acknowledge that many people don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It\u2019s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It\u2019s a pretty simple thing.\u201d",
      "In addition to attending Hollywood events, she has also remained active on Instagram, sharing multiple posts about \u201cAnother Simple Favor.\u201d",

      "When Morgan Wallen quickly left the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stage after performing on the NBC show earlier this year, viewers were left wondering why he was in such a rush. The singer finally gave a brief answer.",
      "In case you missed it, Wallen performed two songs on the March 29 episode of \"SNL.\" He then walked off the stage right after hugging guest host Mikey Madison at the end of the show.",
      "Normally, performers stick around to chat with the host and the show's cast while the credits roll, so Wallen's hasty departure raised some eyebrows.",
      "While appearing on the May 11 episode of the \"Sundae Conversation with Caleb Pressley\" podcast, Wallen briefly spoke out about the controversy.",
      "Pressley brought up the subject by asking Wallen if he's handy around the house.",
      "\u201cCould you fix a TV if it was on\u00a0'SNL'?\u201d he asked.",
      "After laughing, the singer said, \u201cI could change it for sure.\u201d",
      "Now that Wallen was warmed up, Pressley took the opportunity to ask him why he didn't stick around after the show ended.",
      "\u201cSeriously,\u00a0'SNL,' did they make you mad?\u201d he asked.",
      "\u201cNo, no, I was just ready to go home. I'd been there all week,\" Wallen replied.",
      "Hours following Wallen's appearance on \"SNL,\" he took to Instagram to share a photo of a plane and captioned the post, \"Get me to God's country.\" He even started selling merchandise with the phrase on it.",
      "Pressley referenced the post in the interview, saying, \"You had to get your plane. Get me to God's country.\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Wallen replied.",
      "A few days after the star's speedy exit from \"SNL,\" Kenan Thompson offered his opinion on the controversy during an interview with Entertainment Tonight.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds when they decide to do stuff like that. I don\u2019t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way,\u201d he said.",
      "Thompson teased that he thought Wallen \"had to go to the potty or something.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a spike in the norm. We\u2019re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody\u2019s saying, \u2018Good job, good job, good job.\u2019 So when there\u2019s a departure from that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hmm, I wonder what that\u2019s about?\u2019\u201d he said.",

That\u2019s SRK\u2019s reality in India,\u201d actor Zainne Saleh, who starred in \u201cDeli Boys\u201d recently, tells TODAY.com. \"For context, think of cultural icons from another era \u2014 The Beatles or Michael Jackson. That\u2019s the level of adoration felt for him by millions around the world.\u201d",

      "He was one of three Bollywood stars who made their Met Gala debut this year, alongside Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, per the Associated Press. Other known figures in India also returned to the Met Gala this year, like Isha Ambani, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Natasha Poonawalla.",
      "But it was Khan\u2019s presence that sparked controversy, as some fans felt he had been downgraded from one of the world's most famous men to just another Met Gala attendee by journalists seemingly not familiar with his legacy.",
      "In one viral clip that stirred a reaction, a journalist asked Khan's name. Then, during Khan\u2019s interview with Vogue red carpet live stream, Sabyasachi, the designer of Khan's outfit for the evening, clarified his level of fame to interviewers Teyana Taylor and Ego Nwodim.",
      "\u201cJust to give you a little bit of context, Shah Rukh Khan is probably one of the most famous men in the world. His fan following is legendary and we nearly had a stampede outside of the hotel when he came out,\u201d Sabyasachi told the interviewers.",

Franco believes that fans picked up on \u201cthe energy that was given.\u201d He says that \u201cthe energy level was just very, very minimal.\u201d",
      "The chatter about the moment has been spreading around the Internet quickly, with many fans upset about the way his interviews were conducted.",
      "\u201cShah Rukh Khan getting barely 3 seconds at the Met Gala is criminal, but that interviewer not knowing who he was? Truly embarrassing, outrageous and disrespectful,\u201d one fan tweeted.\u00a0 Another called not knowing who he is as \u201ccultural erasure.\u201d",
      "Other commentators didn\u2019t see the issue. One tweeted, \u201cThere was NOTHING disrespectful about the Shah Rukh Khan interview at the Met Gala with Ego and Teyana. Did they need to kiss his a-- to be okay? Y\u2019all need to check yourselves, designer included. no one was humbling him for y\u2019all to do all that.\u201d",
      "Saleh says, more than anything, the controversy pointed to a \u201ccultural disconnect.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that someone can be so beloved yet still so virtually unknown within a media space as massive as the American one. It\u2019s a reminder of how fragmented global fame still is \u2014 and how moments like this, with a little help from social media, can spark meaningful conversations across cultures,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cIt all goes back to a successful song is a song that people can relate to,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cAnd then when they relate to it, they sing along with it; and when they sing along with it, they\u2019re a part of the concert.

      "Hamas agreed to release Edan Alexander, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen believed to be the last living U.S. citizen who remains captive in Gaza, weeks after saying it had lost contact with the group holding him hostage.",
      "His release is part of \u201cthe steps being taken to achieve a ceasefire, open the crossings, and allow aid,\u201d Khalil al-Hayya, head of Hamas\u2019 negotiating team, said in a statement Sunday. Al-Hayya did not provide information on Alexander\u2019s condition.",
      "Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, confirmed the agreement to NBC News and said he is traveling to Israel to secure Alexander\u2019s release.",
      "\u201cWe are picking him up probably tomorrow,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cThere was a long negotiation with lots of people to thank.\u201d",
      "He went on to describe this as a gesture of goodwill toward President Donald Trump, adding that it is a big moment \u201cin large part\u201d because of Trump.",
      "\u201cThe family is ecstatic,\u201d Witkoff said.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social account, the president said he hopes Alexander's release signifies a step toward ending the war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"I am grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen,\" Trump wrote. \"This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators \u2014 Qatar and Egypt \u2014 to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.\"",
      "The Hostage Family Forum released a statement on behalf of Alexander's family confirming that they were informed of the agreement. They are \"in ongoing contact with the U.S. administration\" regarding his potential release in the coming days.\u200b",
      "Alexander was serving in the Israel Defense Forces when he was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, along with roughly 250 others.",
      "Hamas previously agreed to release Alexander in March along with the bodies of four other dual nationals. But weeks later the militant group said it lost contact with group holding him.",
      "At the time, Hamas blamed the issue on Israeli strikes that hit the area where Alexander was allegedly being held.",
      "Hamas and Israel agreed to a temporary ceasefire in January, which led to the release of hostages in exchange for freeing Palestinians in Israeli custody. It also saw an influx of aid for Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.",
      "But the fragile ceasefire fell apart in March after negotiations stalled on how to expand the pause in hostilities into a sustainable end to the war.",
      "Al-Hayya added on Sunday that Hamas was ready to negotiate \"and exert serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war.\"",
      "Gaza's future is unclear after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week that the country's security Cabinet approved a plan to capture the entire enclave. Under this plan, more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza would be \"moved\" out of the strip as Israel's military launched operations to defeat Hamas.",
      "This plan was made public after a full-blown blockade on aid into the strip by Israel reached its third month. Representatives for the United Nations and Palestinians accused Israel of using aid as a \"weapon of war\" at the\u00a0International Court of Justice last month.",
      "Disagreements on how to approach the situation in Gaza as well as Iran has led to tension between Trump and Netanyahu, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge.",
      "While Netanyahu wants to continue a military approach, Trump sees an opportunity to make a deal with a now-weakened Iran, the sources told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu denied the reports on Sunday, insisting in a video on X that his relationship with Trump was \"excellent.\" He added that the two allies see \"eye-to-eye on almost everything.\""

    "story": [
      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.",
      "Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and successful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

      "In his first public comments since the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause on most of their levies in trade talks over the weekend, Xi said Beijing was ready to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries in the face of \u201crising geopolitical tensions and bloc confrontation, unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "While Trump has allies such as El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and Argentinian President Javier Milei, he has alienated much of Latin America with his threats to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal and his derogatory comments about immigrants, said B\u00e1rbara Fern\u00e1ndez Melleda, an assistant professor in Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cIt seems that Donald Trump is certainly Latin American-adverse, and the way he\u2019s been speaking about the Latin American community in the United States has been really sad for us,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, not just in Latin America, is that countries are saying, 'Well, if these big countries are getting hostile, we should just find other partnerships.'\u201d",
      "China played up those tensions in the lead-up to the forum, rejecting the idea of Latin American and Caribbean countries being in anyone\u2019s \u201cbackyard.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the people of Latin America and the Caribbean seek are independence and self-determination, not the so-called new Monroe Doctrine,\u201d Assistant Foreign Minister Miao Deyu was quoted as saying by Chinese state media, referring to the 19th-century U.S. approach to the region as its \u201csphere of influence\u201d that Trump has been accused of trying to revive.",
      "The Cuban ambassador to China, Alberto Blanco Silva, told NBC News after Xi\u2019s speech that he viewed China \u201cas a factor of stability, balance and opportunity \u2014 not only for the world, but also for Latin America.\u201d",
      "China is Latin America\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the United States, and Latin America is the biggest destination for Chinese outbound investment outside Asia. Last year, total trade between China and Latin America exceeded $500 billion for the first time, up from $12 billion in 2000.",
      "Beijing has also been cultivating Latin American ties with an eye on Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy it views as a breakaway province. Most of Taiwan\u2019s few remaining diplomatic allies are in the region, and China peeled away one of them \u2014 Honduras \u2014 in 2023.",
      "Chinese influence in Latin America can be seen in the electric vehicles on its roads as well as massive infrastructure projects, such as the $1.3 billion Chancay port in Peru.",
      "While there are concerns and criticism around such projects, Latin American countries\u2019 relationship with China \u201cseems to be more symmetrical than we are used to,\u201d especially when compared with the U.S. and former colonial rulers in Europe, Fern\u00e1ndez Melleda said.",
      "Xi said Tuesday that China would import more from Latin America, encourage Chinese companies to increase investment and provide 66 billion yuan ($9.1 billion) in fresh credit to support Latin American and Caribbean financing.",
      "The Chinese leader also said he wanted to deepen Latin America\u2019s involvement in Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Colombian\u00a0President Gustavo Petro, who in January agreed to accept U.S. deportation flights after Trump threatened him with sweeping tariffs, said Monday that his country would join Belt and Road.",

      "BEIJING \u2014 The U.S.-China\u00a0tariff cuts, even if temporary, address a major pain point: Christmas presents.",
      "Nearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales last year came from the Christmas holiday season,\u00a0according to CNBC calculations based on data from the National Retail Federation. The period saw a 4% year-on-year sales increase to a record $994.1 billion.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "\u201cWith the speed of Chinese factories, this 90-day window can resolve most of the product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season,\u201d Ryan Zhao, director at export-focused company Jiangsu Green Willow Textile, said Monday in Chinese, translated by CNBC.",
      "His company had paused production for U.S. clients last month. He expects orders to resume but not necessarily to the same levels as before the new tariffs kicked in since U.S. buyers have found alternatives to China-based suppliers in the last few weeks.",
      "U.S. retailers typically place orders months in advance, giving factories in China enough lead time to manufacture the products and ship them to reach the U.S. ahead of major holidays. The two global superpowers\u2019 sudden doubling of tariffs in early April forced some businesses to halt production,\u00a0raising questions\u00a0about whether supply chains would be able to resume work in time to get products on the shelves for Christmas.",
      "\u201cThe 90-day window staves off a potential Christmas disaster for retailers,\u201d Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said Monday.",
      "\u201cIt does not help Father\u2019s Day [sales] and there will still be impact on back-to-school sales, as well as added costs for tariffs and logistics so prices will be going up overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But U.S. duties on Chinese goods aren\u2019t completely gone.",
      "The Trump administration added 20% in tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year in two phases, citing the country\u2019s alleged role in the\u00a0U.S. fentanyl crisis. The addictive drug, precursors to which are mostly produced in China and Mexico, has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S.",
      "The subsequent tit-for-tat trade spat saw duties skyrocketing over 100% on exports from both countries.",
      "While most of those tariffs have been paused for 90 days under the new deal the U.S. and China announced Monday, the previously imposed tariffs will remain in place.",
      "UBS estimates that the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products now stands around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties imposed in past years.",
      "For running shoes produced in China, the total tariff is now 47%, still well above the 17% level in January, said Tony Post, CEO and founder of Massachusetts-based Topo Athletic. He said his company received some cost reductions from its China factories and suppliers, but still had to raise prices slightly to offset the tariff impact.",
      "\u201cWhile this is good news, we\u2019re still hopeful the two countries can reach an acceptable permanent agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed to our Chinese suppliers and are relieved, at least for now, that we can continue to work together.\u201d",
      "U.S. retail giant\u00a0Walmart\u00a0declined to confirm the impact of the reduced tariffs on its orders from China.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by the progress made over the weekend and will have more to say during our earnings call later this week,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNBC. The U.S. retail giant is set to report quarterly results Thursday.",
      "China\u2019s exports to the U.S.\u00a0fell more than 20% in April\u00a0from a year ago, but overall Chinese exports to the world rose 8.1% during that time, official data showed last week. Goldman Sachs estimated around\u00a016 million Chinese jobs\u00a0are tied to producing products for the U.S."

      "LONDON \u2014 A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and supply drones to Russia\u2019s military, according to messages shown to a London court that painted their fugitive leader as a wannabe James Bond.",
      "Jan Marsalek \u2014\u00a0who has been named as a key suspect in Germany\u2019s biggest postwar fraud case \u2014 is alleged to have led the team of six Bulgarians who were sentenced Monday at London\u2019s famous Old Bailey courthouse.",
      "When German payment company Wirecard collapsed in 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, Marsalek, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, went on the run and an international manhunt was launched for the Austrian national, who remains at large.",
      "Messages revealed in court made it clear he was in Moscow as he referred to meetings with the GRU and the FSB state security service, at their headquarters building known as the Lubyanka, and at a \u201cbonding exercise with the FSB guys at the shooting range.\u201d He even posed for a selfie in Russian military fatigues.",
      "Court documents also showed that, while he was on the run, he directed a ragtag group of amateur operatives: Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44; and Ivan Stoyanov, a 33-year-old mixed martial arts fighter known as \u201cThe Rock.\u201d",
      "Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30, described by prosecutors as \u201choneytrap\u201d agents, and competitive swimmer Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 39, made up the rest of the ring that carried out activities that, British police said, put lives and national security at risk.",
      "The spies conducted surveillance for the Russians targeting journalists, diplomats and dissidents in Britain, Austria, Spain and Montenegro, and they were paid handsomely for their services, prosecutors said.",
      "Using law enforcement grade devices called \u201cIMSI grabbers,\u201d prosecutors said they targeted the Patch Barracks, a U.S. base in Stuttgart, Germany, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to operate Patriot missile air defense batteries. This would have helped Russians to target them when they returned to Ukraine to operate the missile batteries, the court heard.",
      "However, following an investigation by Britain\u2019s MI5 spy service, they were arrested on Feb. 8, 2023, as they prepared to return to Germany with the devices hidden in a second-hand Chrysler.",
      "NBC News has contacted Russia\u2019s Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, known as GU, for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said the unit did not work directly for Russian intelligence and their members were motivated by financial gain. Investigators traced $225,000 but believe at least the same amount was paid in cryptocurrency, they said.",
      "In his sentencing, Judge Justice Hilliard said the large amounts of money paid to the six Bulgarian spies demonstrated the \u201cvalue\u201d of their covert activities to Russia.",
      "\u201cSome of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.\u201d",
      "However, prosecutors said that Roussev led the spy ring from a rundown guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a seaside town on the east coast of England, where he stashed his huge collection of spy equipment, much of which he had adapted himself.",
      "Roussev pleaded guilty to spying for Russia in November and was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Dzhambazov was jailed for 10 years and two months and Stoyanov for seven years and seven months.",
      "Ivanova was found guilty in March along with Gaberova and Ivanchev. She was jailed for nine years and eight months. Gaberova and Ivanchev were sentenced to eight years each.",
      "As the sextet awaited sentencing, court documents revealed over 80,000 messages had been recovered from Roussev and Dzhambazov on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, following their arrest on Feb. 8, 2023.",
      "They shed light on the lifestyle of Marsalek in Moscow, revealing he partied with intelligence officers and naked girls, got cosmetic surgery to hide his identity and said he wanted to \u201coutperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "In a bid to show he was \u201cnot an anti-Western ideologue,\u201d Roussev\u2019s defense lawyers introduced messages with Marsalek which, they said, showed their client was \u201cfixing for money\u201d like \u201ceverything else Mr. Roussev does.\u201d",
      "The messages, which were not introduced by prosecutors as part of their Russian espionage allegations, showed the pair discussed a request to help evacuate U.S. and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan during the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from the country in August 2021.",
      "\u201cInteresting request from our (sort of) friends at the CIA,\u201d Marsalek said. \u201cThey urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know anyone who\u2019s a bit rogue and operates large-scale airplanes?\u201d",
      "The objective was \u201cto evacuate about 1,000 Afghan nationals\u201d and \u201c80 US citizens\u201d to Albania, in a deal he said was agreed between the Albanian and U.S. governments.",
      "Roussev said he would ask his father\u2019s pilot contacts in Africa and Marsalek replied: \u201cAmerica needs you, pax Americana rests on your broad and manly shoulders.\u201d",
      "Roussev later said the flight left Kabul shortly before an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a bomb outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killing 170 people and 13 American service members.",
      "Defending Roussev in court, King\u2019s Counsel Mark Summers said the request had come via a private company.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the pair were not acting on a humanitarian basis or at the direct request of the U.S. government.",
      "It remains unclear whether Roussev was successful in ensuring a flight.",

      "In a June 2021 exchange, Marsalek asked whether African diamond sellers wanted guns in exchange or cash. \u201cThey usually buy guns, a lot of them,\u201d noting that he wasn\u2019t sure if rebel forces or the government would benefit from the deal. \u201cAllegedly only government, but who knows, this is Africa,\u201d he said.",
      "Three months earlier, Roussev messaged Marsalek to say he had been approached to supply 886,000 tons of wheat annually to the Cameroon government at a \u201cvery low price\u201d from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.",
      "Describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d considering the volume, he said that weapons and Sputnik COVID vaccines would likely be part of the transaction.\u201d Guns and sputnik = no problem,\u201d Marsalek replied. \u201cCan pretty much organize anything they need except nukes,\u201d he added, with a laughing emoji. \u201cEven the nukes if they pay.\u201d",
      "Other messages offered glimpses of Marsalek\u2019s life in exile and his efforts to stay ahead of authorities, including facial reconstruction.",
      "In May 2021, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m trying to improve my skills on a few fronts, languages is one of them. In my new role as an international fugitive, I must outperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "Four months later, in September of that year, Marsalek apologized for being out of touch, saying he was \u201cstuck between the mafia, half of Russia\u2019s ambassadors, the GRU, a dozen naked girls and some deep-state guys whose names no one knows who forced me to drink a bottle of gin.\u201d",
      "Months later, he told Roussev he had \u201canother cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently.\u201d",
      "\u201cSleep well, sleep is the best fix for this condition,\u201d Roussev replied."

    "summary": "The U.S. and China said they had agreed to a 90-day pause on most of the tariffs they have imposed on each other since last month.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States and China announced a 90-day pause on most of their recent tariffs on each other, fueling hopes on Wall Street of a cooldown in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "The combined U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China\u2019s levies on U.S. imports will fall to 10% from 125%, the countries said early Monday morning.",
      "Officials met in Geneva over the weekend for their first face-to-face talks since President Donald Trump's shock tariff rollout on April 2, when he imposed 84% duties on Chinese imports, adjusted them to to 125% soon afterward, and hiked them further to 145% a day later.",
      "The new 30% rate is the sum of the 20% duty Trump imposed early in his second term over alleged Chinese failures to curb fentanyl flows and the 10% universal tariff he has applied to nearly all foreign imports.",
      "Markets surged on news of the detente. The broad-based S&P 500 was trading 3.1% higher Monday afternoon, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 1,100 points, a roughly 2.7% gain. The tech-focused Nasdaq surged 4.1%.",
      "European indexes posted modest gains Monday. Markets across Asia had upbeat sessions as well ahead of the news, anticipating some kind of trade agreement and also welcoming a ceasefire between India and Pakistan that largely seems to be holding. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index soared on news of the U.S.-China agreement, closing more than 3% higher.",
      "Yet some analysts have urged caution, noting that tariffs remain far higher than before Trump regained office. That suggests many consumer goods \u2014 from cars and groceries to fireworks \u2014 are set to see price hikes. Federal data is set to provide a fresh inflation snapshot on Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cThe full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients Monday, noting that the 90-day countdown \u201cshould keep uncertainty high for both investors and businesses.\u201d",
      "The U.S.'s effective tariff rate would now be 17.8%, the highest since 1934, which Yale Budget Lab researchers estimated Monday would dent households' annual purchasing power by $2,800.",
      "The United States has a larger goods trade deficit with China than with any other country, and Trump has often accused it of \u201cripping off\u201d the U.S. through unfair trade practices. Unlike other U.S. trading partners, Beijing responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs and other countermeasures that escalated into a dizzying game of one-upmanship.",
      "The dueling import taxes were \u201cthe equivalent of an embargo,\u201d which neither side wanted, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \u201cWe do want trade, we want more balanced trade, and I think that both sides are committed to achieving that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bessent, who represented the U.S. in the talks with Beijing along with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, rejected suggestions that negotiating right away would have been more productive than triggering a tariff spat that caused global financial turmoil, saying that a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d effort to rebalance trade would not have worked.",
      "The U.S. and China now have \u201ca mechanism to avoid the upward tariff pressure,\u201d Bessent told CNBC Monday. \u201cI would imagine that in the next few weeks we will be meeting again to get rolling on a more fulsome agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Greer noted that separate discussions on fentanyl were \u201con a very positive track.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the agreement was an  \u201cimportant step\u201d and \u201ccreates favorable conditions for further narrowing differences and deepening cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is hoped that the U.S. will build on the foundation of this meeting, continue to work in the same direction with China\u201d and \u201ccompletely correct its unilateral tariff practices,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "Bessent emphasized that the U.S. does not want a broad-based \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China, preferring instead a \u201cstrategic decoupling, because we realized during Covid that efficient supply chains were not secure supply chains,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cSo with steel, with semiconductors, with medicines, with a couple of other strategic categories, we are going to have to become self-reliant again.\u201d",
      "Tariff impacts are already being felt across the United States, with  shipping volumes from China falling sharply since early April. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said Monday that the 90-day reprieve was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d that it hoped could \u201ccreate the long-term predictability our customers need.\u201d",
      "The agreement is also good news for small and medium-sized businesses \u201con both sides of the Pacific,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. It should be \u201ca very big relief for struggling small Chinese exporters, some of which have already lost U.S. orders for weeks,\u201d while American buyers are gaining some breathing room over surging costs, he said in emailed comments.",
      "The agreement exceeded expectations and has \u201crekindled global hope,\u201d said Wang Wen, dean of the\u00a0Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. But Xu and Wang both cautioned that many difficult issues remain to be resolved.",
      "\u201cThis situation is a major test of the political wisdom and negotiation capability of the decision-makers in both China and the U.S.,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Ahead of the bilateral talks in Geneva, Trump had expressed willingness to slash tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 80%, saying that level \u201cseems right\u201d but leaving the decision to Bessent.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t get any higher,\u201d Trump told reporters late last week. \u201cIt\u2019s at 145, so we know it\u2019s coming down.\u201d"

      "The pontiff spoke with Holt after he made an impassioned plea for peace and expressed solidarity with imprisoned journalists in his first news briefing since becoming pope. Leo called for \u201cthe precious gift of free speech and of the press\u201d to be protected.",
      "Leo, 69, was elected last week as the first pope from the United States.",
      "While the bulk of the\u00a0audience appeared to consist of the legion of journalists who descended on the Vatican from around the world to cover Leo\u2019s selection, Holt said there also appeared to be a few non-reporters in the crowd who brought along babies to be blessed, and that the new pope happily obliged.",
      "There was also somebody who brought over a baseball for Leo to sign. The pontiff\u2019s family says he grew up a fan of the Chicago White Sox."
